![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BookCoverconradgthumb2001.jpg)Thank you for reading *Hell Around the Horn*. I thought that it was a story worth telling, about a time and a remarkable group of people who should not be wholly forgotten. I hope that you found that reading the book was worth your time.

I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on the Hell Around the Horn. Whether you loved or hated the book, or fell somewhere in between, your comments and perspectives are valuable and I would love to hear them. Please contact me through the [Contact page](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/contact/) on the blog. I will respond to all emails and would love to hear from you.

Feel free to return to the on-line retailer where you bought the book and post a review. It need not be more than a line or two and it will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks again,

Rick Spilman
