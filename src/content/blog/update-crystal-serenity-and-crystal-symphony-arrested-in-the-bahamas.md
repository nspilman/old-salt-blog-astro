![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/02/cserenity.jpg)In late January, we [posted about how the cruise ship *Crystal Symphony*](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/01/cruise-ship-crystal-symphony-diverted-to-bahamas-to-avoid-arrest/), which had been bound for Miami, suddenly changed course and diverted to the Bahamas, after a United States federal judge ordered the ship seized over a lawsuit regarding unpaid fuel bills. Not long after, the *Crystal* *Symphony* followed the *Serenity*‘s example.

Admiralty law has caught up with the errant ships. Both the [*Crystal Serenity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Serenity) and [*Crystal Symphony*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Symphony) are now in Freeport, Bahamas and both ships have been arrested for unpaid bills.

As we posted previously, Crystal Cruises is a subsidiary of [Genting Hong Kong Ltd](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/1/24/how-a-billionaires-cruise-empire-imploded-in-hong-kong)., which filed for insolvency last Wednesday, petitioning the Supreme Court of Bermuda to wind up the company and appoint provisional liquidators. It said its cash was expected to run out around the end of January and it had no access to further funding.

Peninsula Petroleum Far East filed a lawsuit in a federal court in South Florida against Crystal Cruises and Star Cruises, also owned by Genting, for owing a combined total of more than $4.6 million in unpaid fuel bills.

There are no passengers currently onboard either ship.
