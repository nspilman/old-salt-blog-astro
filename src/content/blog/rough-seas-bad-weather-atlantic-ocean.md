I love the videos shot and produced by [maritime vlogger JeffHK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGpdSarF_FdCygiA1tOl6Cg/featured). He describes himself as a sailor with a passion for photo/videography and drones who do vlogs while traveling the world on a mega container-ship.

This has been a rough week, so his video of rough weather in the Atlantic on an OOCL container ship seems especially appropriate. The storms at sea have both a fury and a beauty that seems somehow far preferable to what has been going on ashore.
