[HMS *Victory* to replace *Trident* and *Ark Roya*l](http://www.newsbiscuit.com/2010/10/26/hms-victory-to-replace-trident-and-ark-royal/)

*HMS Victory, Nelson’s flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar, is to be brought back into service, replacing Trident and the Ark Royal.*  
  
*‘As the centre-piece of the Strategic Defence Review, HMS Victory will once again give Britain dominance on the high seas,’ said Defence Secretary Liam Fox. ‘The upgraded crew quarters will boast proper toilet facilities to replace the eighteenth-century poop deck, and the refurbished ship’s decks will accommodate the crack carrier pigeon squadron forming a new communications system. The pigeons will reside in an updated crow’s nest.’*

*The Victory will be the first in a planned fleet of naval vessels to be known as the Heritage Fleet. Admiralty Chiefs are known to be considering the addition of HMS Pinafore and are believed to have commissioned a feasibility study for the Tudor battleship Mary Rose, which has submarine capability.*
