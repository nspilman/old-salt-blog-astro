![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/01/ecoclipper.jpg)The Dutch firm [EcoClipper](https://ecoclipper.org/) has plans to launch retrofitted and purpose-built sailing vessels to carry cargo and passengers on a variety of international routes. Today, they announced that they have started to raise capital in cooperation with blockchain partner Bondex, to fund a fleet of sailing cargo ships, one vessel at a time. From their [press release](https://ecoclipper.org/News/press-release-dutch-windship-company-opens-funding-round/):

*It takes substantial investments to build a global sustainable sailing ship fleet. However the strategy of EcoClipper is based on investing in one ship at a time. As such, a series of investment tranches are offered through certificates in the EcoClipper Coöperatie U.A. The first tranche is aiming for €140,000, to purchase the first retrofit vessel. The second and third tranche will bring the financing to almost one million Euros. Follow-up rounds will become larger as the community of the company grows.  Investments for the first tranche start at 50 certificates for a total price of €350. Investors in the early rounds purchase certificates for a discount, while also investing in the future growth of the company.*

*EcoClipper is a shipping company founded in 2018 by Jorne Langelaan, a sail cargo Captain and co-founder of [Fairtransport](https://fairtransport.eu/). EcoClipper is developing a fleet of sailing ships offering emission-free transport and travel worldwide. EcoClipper Coöperatie U.A. was launched in the autumn of 2021,  to offer a more inclusive and democratic structure to investors, team members and clients. The cooperative acts as a holding company, owning the operations company and the future ships. For more information on the business details see the [Information Memorandum, downloadable here.](https://ecoclipper.org/invest/)*

EcoClipper has developed a [prototype purpose-built steel sailing vessel](https://ecoclipper.org/prototype/) based on the design of the Dutch clipper ship, *Noach*, built in 1857 in Kinderdijk. Dubbed the Prototype500, the ship would be a square-rigged three-masted engineless ship with a sail area of 976 m2 and a cargo deadweight of 500 tonnes. Whether a ship of this size would prove to be economically viable or sustainable remains to be seen.
