Bruce Power nuclear power plant Ontario

Last Friday, the [Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission](http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/) approved a plan for [Bruce Power](http://www.brucepower.com/pagecontent.aspx?navuid=1) to ship 1,600 tonnes of radioactive waste,  in the form of 16 decommissioned nuclear reactors,  across the Great Lakes, though the St. Lawrence Seaway and across the Atlantic Ocean to Sweden for recycling.    The plan faces considerable Canadian and international opposition.   Members of the Canada’s nuclear regulator and representatives of Bruce Power are expected to be called before a Canadian Commons committee to be grilled over plans to ship used the used radioactive generators through the Great Lakes.
