*Announcing Inspired Insanity and I will solo sail the world, non-stop this time.The start date is July 2015. Life is on a fast track. INSPIRED INSANITY has been undergoing more refits: new bulkheads, reinforced mast step, boom….I will use celestial navigate the world this time.The long distance radio, SSB will be used for weather, contact, sail mail…sticking to my guns to be totally intuned with the ocean, the stars, the clouds and weather patterns. Most of history, ocean navigators have used their senses, sextant, compass, and intuition to navigate.The SSB is old technology but reliable.I want to gain those skills. Along the way OceansWatch surveys and research along with other surveys of wildlife, water quality will be done. My greatest desire is to hone the skills of become a writer. So…Hang on to your shorts. Get involved. Keep an eye on this website as life is happening.*
