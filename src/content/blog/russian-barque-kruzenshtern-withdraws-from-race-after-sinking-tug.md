The Russian four-masted barque [*Kruzenshtern*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruzenshtern_\(ship\)) has been forced to withdraw from the [Falmouth Tall Ships Regatta](http://www.sailtraininginternational.org/events/2014-falmouth-royal-greenwich-tall-ships-regatta-)[,](http://www.sailtraininginternational.org/events/2014-falmouth-royal-greenwich-tall-ships-regatta-) after it was involved in the sinking of a tug in the Danish port of Esbjerg last week. The *Kruzenshtern,* ex-*Padua*, was built in 1926 and is one of the largest tall ships in service.  [*The Packet*](http://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/news/11410363.Biggest_tall_ship_pulls_out_of_regatta_after_sinking_tug_in_Denmark/)  reports that the barque was permitted to continue its journey to Germany, but an investigation into the sinking has been launched by authorities.

On August 4, the tugs *Dive Master* and *Svitzer Helios* were assisting the *Kruzenshtern* as it departed the port of Esbjerg.  A hawser between the barque and the tug *Dive Master* fouled on being released, pulling the tug toward the sailing ship. *[Diver Master](http://www.vesselfinder.com/news/2263-Tug-sinks-in-an-accident-with-a-tall-ship)* [capsized and sank in 10 metres of water](http://www.vesselfinder.com/news/2263-Tug-sinks-in-an-accident-with-a-tall-ship) near Fano Island.  The tug crew was rescued without serious injury.  Thanks to Ulrich Rudofsky for contributing to this post.
