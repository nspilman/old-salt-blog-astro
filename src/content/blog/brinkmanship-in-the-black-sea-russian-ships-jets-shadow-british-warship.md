![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hmsdefender.jpg)Yesterday, more than 20 Russian aircraft and two coastguard ships shadowed the Royal Navy destroyer, [HMS *Defender*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Defender_\(D36\)), sailing near Crimea. Moscow’s defence ministry said a patrol ship fired warning shots and a jet dropped bombs in the path of HMS *Defender* as it sailed some 12 miles (19km) off Crimea’s coast. The UK government rejected Russia’s account of the incident and denied that any warning shots had been fired.

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57583363) reports that HMS *Defender* was sailing from Odessa in southern Ukraine to Georgia. To get there, it passed south of the Crimea peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that has not been recognized internationally.

While Moscow claims the peninsula and its waters are Russian territory, the UK says HMS *Defender* was passing through Ukrainian waters in a commonly used and internationally recognized transit route.

A source told BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale that the *Defender* was not there to pick a fight but to make a point – to assert its right to freedom of navigation in international waters.
