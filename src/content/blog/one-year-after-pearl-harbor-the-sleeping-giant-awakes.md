Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor  reportedly wrote in his diary, “I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.” Whether or not the Admiral actually penned those words is [subject to debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto%27s_sleeping_giant_quote), however, there is no doubt that the attack did awaken a sleeping giant — the industrial might of the United States.

On December 7, 1942, exactly one year after the attack on Pearl Harbor, American shipyards launched 25 ships, 15 for the US Navy, including the [Essex Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex-class_aircraft_carrier) aircraft carrier [USS *Bunker Hill*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bunker_Hill_\(CV-17\)) and the 45,000-ton battleship [USS *New Jersey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_New_Jersey_\(BB-62\)). The [British Movietone newsreel](https://youtu.be/hbUd6w4X1w8) below described the launchings on Pearl Harbor Day in 1942 as “only a fraction of Roosevelt’s mathematical certainty of the fate in store for Japan.”

Despite the view by many that the Pearl Harbor attack struck the death knell for battleships, the *New Jersey* went on to have a long and storied career. During World War II, *New Jersey* shelled targets on Guam and Okinawa, and screened aircraft carriers conducting raids in the Marshall Islands. During the Korean War, she was involved in raids up and down the North Korean coast, after which she was decommissioned.

She was briefly reactivated in 1968 and sent to Vietnam to support US troops before returning to the mothball fleet in 1969. Reactivated once more in the 1980s as part of the 600-ship Navy program, *New Jersey* was modernized to carry missiles and recommissioned for service. In 1983, she participated in US operations during the Lebanese Civil War.

The [USS *New Jersey* is now a museum ship in Camden, New Jersey](https://www.battleshipnewjersey.org/). Here is a video from a year ago about the construction and launching of the USS *New Jersey* narrated by the museum’s curator, Ryan Szimanski.
