*BMW Oracle won the America’s Cup as victory in Sunday’s second race off Valencia against Swiss holders Alinghi gave them an unassailable 2-0 lead in the best-of-three series.*

*The victory means the Golden Gate Yacht Club of San Francisco will now defend the America’s Cup in the 34th staging of an event which dates back to 1851.*
