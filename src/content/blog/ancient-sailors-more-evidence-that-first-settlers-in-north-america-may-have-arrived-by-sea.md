More evidence that the [first travelers to the Americas may have been sailors](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/coopers-ferry-first-americans/).

The classic theory of the arrival of early people in North America was the Clovis model. The theory was that early humans migrated to North America by walking over an Alaskan landbridge from Asia around 13,000 years ago. Roughly 14,000 years ago, the landbridge became passible due to the retreat of ice due to rising temperatures. 

Now, a [team of archeologists working in Cooper’s Ferry, Idaho](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6456/891) have uncovered artifacts dating back to 16,000 years ago, well before the landbridge was clear of ice. Whomever these early humans were, they did not walk from Asia. They most likely arrived by boat. Evidence suggests that glaciers retreated from the Pacific coast around 17,000 years ago which would have allowed early Asian sailors to make their way up the Columba River valley to Cooper’s Ferry. 

The Asian origins of these early sailors is also reinforced by the discovery at Cooper’s Ferry of spearheads very similar to spearheads found in Japan from the same time period. The spearheads are of a significantly different design than Clovis spearheads. 

The discoveries at Cooper’s ferry add significantly to existing evidence that early migrants to North America came by sea. Artifacts discovered in 1976 in [Monte Verde, Chile, dating back 14,500 years](https://anthropology.net/2008/05/08/earliest-known-archaeological-evidence-of-americans-found-in-monte-verde-chile/), suggest pre-Clovis settlers who most likely traveled by water. Since then various sites along the Pacific coast, including Cedros Island, Mexico and Calvert Island, off British Columbia, have suggested settlement by pre-Clovis mariners.
