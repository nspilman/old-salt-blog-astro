USS Recruit, 1917, Union Square, NYC

Perhaps no warship is unsinkable, but the several USS *Recruits* came close, primarily because they were based entirely on land.  In 1917, the 200′ [USS *Recruit*, also known as the *Landship Recruit*,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Recruit_\(1917\)) was built in [Union Square, in the middle of New York City.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2289739/The-battleship-Union-Square-How-200ft-boat-ended-middle-downtown-Manhattan-WWI.html) USS *Recruit* was a wooden dreadnought battleship, commissioned as vessel of the U.S. Navy and manned by a crew of trainee sailors. She was used for recruiting and training during World War I.  The New York Times reported at the time that the “Landship” helped the U.S. Navy recruit 25,000 men or enough to crew twenty-eight *Nevada*\-class battleships.  In 1920, with the end of the war, the ship was dismantled.

Almost 30 years later, a second [USS *Recruit*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Recruit_\(TDE-1\)) was built, this time on the West Coast of the United States. The second landbound USS *Recruit* was built at the Naval Training Center in the Point Loma area of San Diego. Not a dreadnought like her predecessor, she was a two-thirds scale *Dealey*\-class destroyer escort.  She was used to train recruits from 1949 until the base was closed in 1997.  The *Recruit* still stands, unused, adjacent to a retail area of Liberty Station, as the redeveloped base is known.
