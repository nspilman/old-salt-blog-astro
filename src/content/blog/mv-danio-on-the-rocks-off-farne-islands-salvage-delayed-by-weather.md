Early on Saturday, the 80 m coaster [*MV Danio*](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?mmsi=304109000) hit the rocks on the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast, after sailing from Perth, Scotland to Antwerp, Belgium with a cargo of timber.  The German-owned, Antigua-registered vessel is stuck near the Longstone Lighthouse, close to where heroine Grace Darling and her lighthouse keeper father carried out the famous rescue from the steamship Forfarshire in 1838.   The Farne Islands are internationally known for the thousands of puffins which live there, as well as 6,000 grey seals and more than 20 bird species that breed there.  Plans to salvage the ship and crew may be delayed until next week due to the bad weather.
