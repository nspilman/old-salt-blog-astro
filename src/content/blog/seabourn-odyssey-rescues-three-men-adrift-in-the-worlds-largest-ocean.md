Seaborne rescue boat approaching drifting fishermen

The Pacific Ocean is indeed the world’s largest ocean. It is hard to grasp just how many fisherman from the myriad of islands in the Pacific become lost, are carried away by a storm, break down or run out of fuel and find themselves adrift on this vast ocean. This month we posted “[US Army Landing Craft, Great Bridge, Rescues 101 Adrift in the Pacific](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/02/10/us-army-landing-craft-great-bridge-rescues-101-adrift-in-the-pacific/),” and last November we posted, “[Adrift in the Pacific – Two Kiribati Men Missing for 33 Days Come Ashore in Marshall Islands](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/30/adrift-in-the-pacific-two-kiribati-men-missing-for-33-days-come-ashore-in-marshall-islands/).”  A year before we posted about “[Three Teenagers Found Alive after Fifty Days adrift in Pacific Ocean](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/25/three-teenagers-found-alive-after-fifty-days-adrift-in-pacific-ocean/).”   One wonders how many are never found.

This Sunday, the *[Seaborne Odyssey](http://www.seabourn.com/luxury-cruise-vacation-onboard/Odyssey)* rescued three fishermen adrift in the Pacific 150 miles southwest of Pago Pago, America Samoa.  The fishermen had sailed from Apia in Western Samoa, had ran out of fuel and had been adrift for nearly three weeks.  This is apparently the second rescue involving a Seabourn ship in less than a year.  
  
One can only imagine the shock the fishermen must have felt when they went from their fishing boat to one of the more luxurious small cruise ships operating today.  The passengers on the *Seaborne Odyssey* collected $2,400 for the three men, who were disembarked in Pago Pago.
