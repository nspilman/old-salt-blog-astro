[Poveglia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poveglia) is a small island located between Venice and Lido in the Venetian Lagoon of northern Italy. Once a quarantine for plague victims, the island contains one or more pits where plague victims were buried en-masse. Some estimates suggest that 100,000 people died on the island over the centuries. It was later the home of a hospital for the mentally ill, which legend has it was run by a cruel doctor who performed unauthorized experiments on its residents. Perhaps not surprisingly, it is said to be the [“most haunted” island](http://www.travelchannel.com/tv-shows/ghost-adventures/articles/poveglia-islands-haunted-history) in the world. It is also available for sale, or more precisely, a [99 year lease from the Italian government](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poveglia-worlds-most-haunted-island-up-for-auctionis-anyone-be-brave-enough-to-buy-it-9264797.html).

Not everyone is pleased by the prospective privitization of the island. A group of Venetians has formed the [Poveglia Per Tutti (Poveglia For All) association](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/venetians-fight-to-save-haunted-island-from-luxury-developers-1.1770112) to oppose the sale or lease. The group is seeking help in raising money to buy the island.  If you would like to share in the public ownership of an island in Venice with a colorful history, click here: [Message-in-a-Bottle.org](http://www.message-in-a-bottle.org/)
