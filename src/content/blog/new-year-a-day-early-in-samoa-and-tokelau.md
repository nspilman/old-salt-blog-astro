New Year’s Day came a day early this year to [Samoa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa) and the [Tokelau atolls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokelau) in the South Pacific, while [Friday, December 30th, disappeared entirely.](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/12/30/samoa-skips-friday-in-leap-across-international-date-line/)  After being east of the International Date Line for almost 120 years, Samoa and the Tokelau atolls decided to move west, or more accurately to move the International Date Line, so that the islands are now west of the line. In doing so, they effectively made yesterday, Friday the 30th, disappear.  On the other hand, Samoa celebrated two July 4ths when they decided to shift east of the line back in 1892.

Notionally, the International Date Line follows the 180 degree meridian of longitude, but for practical reasons is diverted around land masses and islands. Samoa was once more economically tied to the United States, so it chose to be on the east of the date line.  Now that Samoa and the Tokelau atolls do more business with Australia and New Zealand, it made more sense that the islands are on the same side of the date line as their economic partners.

We at the Old Salt Blog wish you all a happy and prosperous New Year regardless of which side of the date line you may find yourself.
