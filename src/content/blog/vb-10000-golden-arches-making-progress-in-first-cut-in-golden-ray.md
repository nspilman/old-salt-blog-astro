After being delayed by hurricanes, the pandemic, and a broken link in the cutting chain, the heavy-lift catamaran [VB-10,000, nicknamed the “Golden Arches”](https://www.vbar.com/vb10000/index.html) is now making good progress on the first cut to slice the stricken car carrier, *[Golden Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Golden_Ray)* into sections that can be loaded onto a barge and hauled away to scrap.

In September of 2019, the car carrier *Golden Ray* lost stability and partially capsized as it departed the Port of Brunswick, GA, carrying about 4,200 vehicles. The ships and its cargo were declared a total loss. The VB-10,000 is now cutting the 660-foot long ship into sections by hoisting a heavy chain to rip through the ship’s hull.
