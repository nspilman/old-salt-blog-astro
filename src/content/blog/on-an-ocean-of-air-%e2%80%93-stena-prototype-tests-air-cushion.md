![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pmax540.jpg)The idea that cushion of air bubbles might significantly reduce ship resistance through the water has been around for some time. Now Stena is testing the concept with 15 meter prototype vessel.

*Stena Teknik is using a 15m long ship prototype to evaluate the extent to which an air cushion can reduce the friction between a ship’s hull and the water. Named Stena Airmax in ceremonies held in Gothenburg, Swden, today, the 15 m technology demonstrator is a prototype for a 182 m full scale ship.*

*Stena is investing some SEK 50 million in the air cushion project. The large scale model, which weighs around 25 tons, has been developed following very good results achieved in tests with small ship models.*

*Five years ago, Stena Teknik initiated a development project in order to find a method of reducing a ship’s water resistance, thus radically reducing energy utilzsation and fuel consumption.*

*“The results of the tests carried out are very promising. Depending on the type of ship and speed, we expect energy savings of 20-30 percent. This will now be verified in tests with the newly built prototype Stena Airmax,” says Ulf G. Ryder, President and CEO of Stena Bulk.*
