![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/03/grandprincess.jpg)In a press conference yesterday, [Vice President Pence announced](https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/03/07/vice-president-mike-pence-to-speak-at-port-everglades-addressing-cruise-line-coronavirus-concerns/) that of the 45 people tested on the cruise ship [*Grand Princess*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Princess), 21 has been found to be infected with the coronavirus Covid-19. Of the 21, 19 were ship’s crew and two were passengers. The San Francisco bound ship had been held offshore in the Pacific pending the results of the testing.

He said that the ship would be moved to a “non-commercial port” this weekend. “All passengers and crew will be tested for the coronavirus,” Pence said. “Those that need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those that require additional medical attention will receive it.” 

There are more than 3,500 people aboard the *Grand Princess* — 2,422 guests and 1,111 crew members, Princess Cruises said. They represent 54 nationalities. Passengers on the ship first learned of the test results through the media. Overnight, the US Coast Guard delivered supplies by helicopter to the ship, which is still approximately 20 miles off San Francisco. 

A passenger from the previous *Grand Princess* voyage to Mexico was infected with the coronavirus and died. Subsequently, a [second passenger from the Mexican voyage has died](https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/health-wellbeing/four-australians-on-coronavirus-struck-cruise-ship-grand-princess-off-san-francisco-coast-c-731557) and at least [six others are sick with the virus.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/confirmed-coronavirus-cluster-from-grand-princess-mexican-cruise-continues-to-grow/ar-BB10QwgA?ocid=hplocalnews)

Approximately, 60 passengers from the previous cruise stayed aboard the ship for the current cruise.

The first case of the [coronavirus in Hawaii](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/03/07/hawaii-news/hawaiis-first-case-of-coronavirus-confirmed-gov-david-ige-announces/) has been confirmed to be a recent passenger of the *Grand Princess.*   

As to the procedure for dealing with the virus on the *Grand Princess*, the president has sent confused messages, saying, “I like the numbers being where they are. I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault. And it wasn’t the fault of the people on the ship either, ok? It wasn’t their fault either and they’re mostly Americans,” Trump said. But, he added, he would abide by what Pence and his team of “great experts” decide.
