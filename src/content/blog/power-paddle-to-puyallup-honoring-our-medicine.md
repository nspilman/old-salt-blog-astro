![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/canoejourney.jpg)Every year, thousands of people join in on a [canoe journey across the Pacific Northwest](http://www.dailyuw.com/events/article_2b2fbbe8-8e10-11e8-87bb-47963b48d240.html) to celebrate traditional Native American culture. The long paddle includes multiple stops hosted by local tribes along the route. This year’s journey is called [Power Paddle to Puyallup.](http://paddletopuyallup.org/index.php)  Paddlers in canoes, some traveling as far as British Columbia and California, are expected to arrive in Puyallup, WA, this Friday, July 28. More than 10,000 people are expected for the welcoming ceremony. The Puyallup Tribe will host the event for eight days, July 29-Aug 4, which includes feasting, singing, dancing, drumming and sharing through giveaways. This year’s theme is “Honoring Our Medicine.”

“Our tribal communities are continuing to practice our culture traveling by canoe on the water,” Puyallup Tribe culture director Connie McCloud said. “We are learning our songs, our dances, we’re making our regalia, and we’re getting ready to share our cultures with each other and our local communities.” 

[The Daily](http://www.dailyuw.com/events/article_2b2fbbe8-8e10-11e8-87bb-47963b48d240.html) reports: *[Tribal canoe journeys](http://paddletopuyallup.org/about.php) are a revival of historic Pacific Northwest tribal practices. Traditionally, families would canoe from one homeland to another and visit native communities along the way. The contemporary annual journey seeks to honor that tradition.*

*“Being a part of my culture and sharing it with my son is why I do this,” Andrea Bob, assistant coordinator for the canoe journey, wrote in an email. “It is a reminder of our traditions and brings a sense of community through all fellow canoe families we see every summer when we go. Participating every year is a great reminder of identity for myself and my son.”* 

*Canoers will be welcomed with a large ceremony featuring the ancient coastal tradition of potlatching, or celebrating with a gift-giving feast once they arrive in Puyallup. People will wear traditional clothing, perform dances and songs, and eat plenty of food*.

In 1989 Emmett Oliver revitalized the centuries-old tradition of canoeing by organizing the “Paddle to Seattle” as part of Washington States centennial ceremony. His dedication to launching this revival of a tradition now continues more than a quarter century later as is now known as [Canoe Journey](http://paddletopuyallup.org/about.php).
