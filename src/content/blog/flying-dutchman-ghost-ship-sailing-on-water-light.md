![ghostship1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/04/ghostship1.jpg)What should a ghost ship be made of? Why not water, wind and light? That is precisely what the designers at the Romanian Art collective [Visual Skin](http://www.visualskin.ro/post/105909027108/ghost-ship) used to create the [Flying Dutchman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Dutchman), a glowing ghost ship anchored in front of ARCAM Amsterdam Centre for Architecture and the Scheepvaartmuseum.  It floated gently on the water of the canal,  with the spectral sails billowing in the wind. The ghost ship was part of the [Amsterdam Light Festival](http://www.amsterdamlightfestival.com/en/) which ended last January. Thanks to [Cynthia Drew](http://cynthiadrew.com/) for pointing it out.

The video below shows how Visual Skin made the magic happen.
