Following the tragic sinking of HMS Bounty, both the HMS Bounty organization and the Lynx Educational Foundation have set up relief funds for the crews and families of those lost on the ship.

*A Relief fund has been set up by both HMS Bounty Organization AND a couple of our former beloved crew members. We are working with the former crew members as well as initiating another way of donating to help raise as much money as possible for our 14 surviving crew as well as the families of Claudene Christian AND Captain Robin Walbridge. Please find it in your hearts to help out. You can donate via paypal at HMSBounty2012@Yahoo.com or by going to our [website and clicking on the online store](http://www.tallshipbounty.org/online-store/index.php) where you will see a button to donate via paypal. We thank everyone for the support and prayers!*

*In honor and in memory of the sailing crew of the HMS Bounty, the Lynx Educational Foundation and Privateer Lynx has established a crew assistance fund starting with $500.00 in hopes that the effort will help in a small way of the immediate relocation needs of our friends of the HMS Bounty. Please join us and contribute what you can to help these brave individuals. Make your donation today for the HMS Bounty Crew Relief Effort Fund*
