This has been a season of extreme weather. While [Australia is suffering a record heat wave](http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/record-setting-heat-wave-in-au/21789651), the US and Europe have been [battered by a series of ugly winter storms and frigid temperatures](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-weather-ferocious-storms-battering-2995875). Here is a song with an appropriate video for those of us in the northern hemisphere trying to keep warm. It is not strictly nautical though Gordon Bok has sung so many wonderful songs about boats, ships and the sea, that his music always seems to me to have a salty air.
