The  [Space Shuttle Enterprise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Enterprise) was built as a prototype. As such it never flew in space. That is not to say, however, that it hasn’t traveled. In April, [we caught it on video taking a ride on a NASA 747 up the Hudson River](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/27/space-shuttle-endeavour-arrives-in-new-york/) to land in Kennedy Airport on its way to a permanent home at the [Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum.](http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/)  Yesterday, it took a short sea voyage by barge, out past Coney Island, up through the  Verrazano Narrows Bridge before finally  docking at Port Elizabeth, N.J.  It will stay in Jersey until Tuesday. The shuttle goes on permanent display on July 19th.  [For more photos, check out Will van Dorp’s tugster blog.](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/voyage-of-the-starship-enterprise/)     Video of the move after the jump.
