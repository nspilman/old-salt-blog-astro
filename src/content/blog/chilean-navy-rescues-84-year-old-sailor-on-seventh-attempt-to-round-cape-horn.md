The good news is that the Chilean Navy, assisted by the Japanese merchant ship, *White Kingdom*, have rescued Thomas Louis Corogin, an 84-year-old American sailor, after his seventh failed attempt to round Cape Horn, single handed.  Corogin is now safely ashore after the mast on his Westsail 32 sailboat cracked when the backstay failed. The bad news is that Mr. Corogin is not ruling out another try.  He has been [quoted as saying on his arrival onshore](http://articles.boston.com/2012-01-09/news/30608241_1_sailing-lessons-easter-island-chilean-navy), “Age means nothing. What is important is that you are alive, so I don’t worry about numbers. I worry about life. That, I think, is more important.’’

After a search by the Chilean Navy,  Corogin was ultimately picked up by the Japanese merchant vessel *White Kingdom,* a 53,400 DWT bulk carrier*.* A  Chilean Navy frigate with a helicopter and medical team then picked him up for transport to shore.  The Chilean government is [paying for the entire cost of the rescue](http://www.portclintonnewsherald.com/article/20120106/NEWS01/201060312/Local-man-bails-7th-effort-round-Cape-Horn).

This may be an example of when persistence is not necessarily a virtue.  Thanks to Phil Leon for passing the story along.
