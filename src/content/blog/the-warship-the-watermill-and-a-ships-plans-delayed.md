USS Chesapeake, from frigate to mill

Last Sunday, [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/27/the-first-six-frigates-birth-of-the-us-navy/) about the authorization for the  construction of the first six frigates for the US Navy in 1794.   The folks at [Maritime Great Britain](http://maritimegreatbritain.freeforums.org/) were kind enough to pass along two related stories.  
  
One of the six frigates, the [*USS Constitution*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution) is still in service and is said to be the world’s oldest floating commissioned naval vessel.   The *Constitution* has an odd, tangential connection to the  oldest British  warship still afloat, HMS *[Trincomalee](http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/)*, a Leda class frigate launched in 1817.   Because of shortages of oak, the *Trincomalee* was built in India of teak.  The plans for the construction of the ship were being carried to India aboard the [HMS *Java*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Java_\(1811\)) in 1812, during the second war with the ex-North American colonies.  USS *Constitution* defeated the *Java,* which subsequently sank, taking the plans with her.  Another set of plans for the construction of the *Trincomalee* did finally arrive in India, but only after a delay of several months.

During the war of 1812 the USS *Constitution* defeated five British warships,  [HMS *Guerriere*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Guerriere_\(1806\) "HMS Guerriere (1806)"),  [*Java*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Java_\(1811\) "HMS Java (1811)"),  [*Pictou*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Pictou_\(1813\) "HMS Pictou (1813)"),  [*Cyane*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Cyane_\(1806\) "HMS Cyane (1806)") and *[Levant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Levant_\(1813\) "HMS Levant (1813)"),* as well as capturing a number of merchant vessels.  Her battle with [HMS *Guerriere*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Guerriere_\(1806\) "HMS Guerriere (1806)") earned her the nickname “Old Ironsides” after a British broadside bounced off her hull.

*[USS Chesapeake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Chesapeake_\(1799\))* was not as successful as the *USS Constitution* but played at least as large a role in history.  In 1807, *HMS Leopard* while searching for British deserters fired on the *Chesapeake* killing three and injuring 18 of her crew.  What would become known as the [Chesapeake-Leopard Affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake-Leopard_Affair) significantly increased tensions between the two nations in the run up to the War of 1812.

In 1813 the *Chesapeake* was taken by [HMS *Shannon*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Shannon_\(1806\)) in a bloody ship to ship battle.    The *Chesapeake*‘s Captain James Lawrence was mortally wounded. His dying words were “Don’t give up the ship.”   Three months later the phrase was adopted by Commodore Perry who flew “Don’t Give up the Ship”  on his battle flag during his victory at the [Battle of Lake Erie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Erie).

The USS *Chesapeake* was taken into the Royal Navy as  the HMS  *Chesapeake* until she was broken up in 1819.  In 1820 her timbers were used to build a  mill in Wickham, England which continued to operate until 1975.  Today  the [Chesapeake Mill](http://www.chesapeakemill.co.uk/index.html) is  home to antique dealers and gift shops.
