![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bastoe.jpg)The [Daily Scandinavian](https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/worlds-largest-electric-ferry-now-operational-in-norway/) reported that last March the world’s largest all-electric ferry went into full operation on the 5.67 nautical mile route between the two Norwegian cities of Moss and Horten, on Norway’s busiest ferry route.

The new ferry, named *Bastø Electric*, built at Sefine Shipyard in Turkey, is the first of three battery-powered ferries intended to operate on a route across the Oslo Fjord. Bastø Electric measures 139.2 meters in length and is 21 meters wide. Top speed is 13 knots (24 km/h). The *Bastø Electric* can carry either 200 cars or 24 trucks, as well as 600 passengers. 

While *Bastø Electric* is currently the largest all-electric ferry, it is not the first. The [first fully-electric ferry to enter active service in Norway](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/01/norway-to-launch-first-electrically-powered-car-ferry/) was the *MF Ampere* in early 2015. In 2019, [*Ellen,* then the world’s largest all-electric ferry](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/08/green-energy-in-denmark-world-largest-electric-ferry-new-offshore-wind-farm/), capable of carrying 30 vehicles and 200 passengers, completed its maiden voyage in Denmark.
