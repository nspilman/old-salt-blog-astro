![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oceanbird.jpg)A Swedish consortium that includes [Wallenius Marine](https://www.walleniusmarine.com/our-services/ship-design-newbuilding/ship-design/wind-powered-vessels/) has designed [*Oceanbird*](https://www.oceanbirdwallenius.com/), a five-masted sailing car carrier, that could have a huge impact on the development of modern commercial sail.  The design is intended to be finished in 2021 with potential delivery by 2025.

*Oceanbird* is a revolutionary design. It is not a small vessel. Whereas [another sailing ro/ro project](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/08/neoline-to-build-sailing-car-carriers-at-neopolia/) is working toward building a ship with a capacity of fewer than 500 vehicles, the *Oceanbird* design is a full-sized car carrier, 200 meters long with a 40 meter beam, and a capacity to carry 7,000 vehicles. If built, *Oceanbird* will be the largest sailing cargo ship that the world has ever seen.

Most large sailing assist projects have been distinctly incremental. Twin Flettner rotors on the Long Range 2 product tanker, [*Maersk Pelican*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/11/update-one-year-on-rotor-sail-savings-on-maersk-pelican-on-target/), for example, have succeeded in reducing fuel consumption by almost 10%, which is right within the predicted range of outcomes. 

By contrast, *Oceanbird* is designed to cut emissions by 90%. The ship will have engines for maneuvering and light airs but is intended to be primarily a sailing ship. *Oceanbird* will be powered by five telescoping rigid wing sails that will tower 80 meters over the ship. By comparison, the main mast of the clipper ship [*Cutty Sark*](https://www.rmg.co.uk/cutty-sark/history/cutty-sark-construction-facts-figures) is 47 meters tall.

*Oceanbird* will not be as fast as her fossil-fueled sisters. The *Oceanbird* is designed to cross the North Atlantic in 12 days, whereas a conventional car carrier would cross in eight.

In addition to Wallenius Marine, which is controlled by the founding family of the Wallenius RoRo shipping group — the consortium includes Sweden’s [Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) and shipping consultancy [SSPA](https://www.sspa.se/). The project is co-financed by the Swedish Transport Administration.
