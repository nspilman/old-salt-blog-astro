(Thanks to LizMc on the [Horatians](http://www.horatians.org/forum/index.php) forum.) According to the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/content/articles/2008/09/18/history_ann_cargill_feature.shtml), Ann Carghill was **“**was the Britney Spears of her day.”  I think they slight poor Ms Cargill.

**“**When the packet ship, The Nancy, was wrecked off the Isles of Scilly in 1784 one of the victims included Ann Cargill, one of the most famous and highest paid Opera singers of the time and whose numerous affairs and elopements had scandalised London**.”**

Divers believe that they have found one of Britain’s most romantic shipwrecks, reputedly laden with jewels owned by the wealthiest and most notorious actress and opera singer of her day.

When *The Nancy* was dashed to pieces off the Isles of Scilly in February 1784 the victims included Ann Cargill, a singer whose many affairs and elopements had scandalised London.

Her body was recovered a week after the sinking off the uninhabited island of Rosevear, with an infant – believed to be her illegitimate child – cradled in her arms. But neither *The Nancy* nor Mrs Cargill’s vast fortune in jewels and cash – amounting to at least £200,000, according to newspapers at the time – was ever found.
