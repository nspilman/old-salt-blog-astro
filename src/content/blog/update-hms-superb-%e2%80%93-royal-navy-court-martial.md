Commander Drysdale

Last January we posted about the the [*HMS Superb*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Superb_\(S109\)), a  British nuclear submarine, which in 2008 crashed into a massive stone pinnacle under the Red Sea. (See [Submarines Navigating Badly](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/01/25/submarines-navigating-badly/).)   Now the commander and two other officers have been severely reprimanded by a Royal Navy court martial.  Apparently all concerned just misread the chart.

[Commander of submarine in crash misread chart, court martial told](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/mar/15/submarine-crash-navy-court-martial)  
  
*A Royal Navy commander crashed a nuclear-powered submarine into a large rock in the Red Sea after misreading a number one as seven on a navigational chart, a court martial heard today.*

*Commander Steven Drysdale, who was in charge of HMS Superb, had ordered the vessel to take a shorter route to make sure it reached a rendezvous point in time for an operation. The submarine dived to reach deeper water so that it could travel faster, the hearing at Portsmouth naval base was told.*

*A pinnacle jutting out from the seabed was marked as being at a depth of 123 metres, but Drysdale misread it as 723. Thinking that the boat would clear the obstruction easily, the submarine was directed towards it and it grounded.*

*Drysdale, officer of the watch Lieutenant Commander Andrew Cutler and navigation officer Lieutenant Lee Blair all admitted at a previous hearing an offence of neglecting to perform their duty.*
