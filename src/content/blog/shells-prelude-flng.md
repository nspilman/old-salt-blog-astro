Shell is on its way to building the largest floating offshore facility in the world for its [Prelude Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) Project in Australia.](http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/prne/shell/48922/) The FLNG facility will be 488 meters long  and will weigh around 600,000 tonnes – roughly six times as much as the largest aircraft carrier.  It will be longer longer and heavier than the new [Maersk Triple E ships](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/26/maersk-triple-e-class-ships-the-vlccs-of-container-shipping/) which, when delivered, will be 400 meters long.  The FLNG will also be longer than the largest ship ever  built, the *[Seawise Giant/Jahre Viking/Knock Nevis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawise_Giant),* which was scrapped in 2010.  The *Knock Nevis* was 458 meters long, but did displace more, at 657,019 tonnes, than will the FLNG.

The FLNG will be deployed over the [Prelude field](http://www.shell.com.au/home/content/aus/aboutshell/who_we_are/shell_au/operations/upstream/prelude/) located approximately 475 kilometres north-northeast of Broome, Western Australia, and over 200 kilometres from the nearest point on the mainland. The field is too far offshore to use conventional techniques of building gas-compression platforms and long subsea pipelines to shore. Instead, the natural gas will be liquefied on the vessel and loaded onto LNG ships for transport.
