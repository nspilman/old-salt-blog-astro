There will be some changes for anyone subscribing to the Old Salt Blog by email.  We have been using Google’s Feedburner email feed, which, over the years, has worked more or less. Google, however, is discontinuing the Feedburner email feed in July, so we have switched to a new service, [follow.it](https://follow.it/). 

We are still figuring out the details and features of the new feed, so we beg for your indulgence and patience while we get things set up. Thanks.
