[Oman Bursary Scheme](http://www.sailtraininginternational.org/get-on-board/how-to-get-involved/funding---oman-bursary-)  
  
*Funding is available for young people interested in experiencing saling on a Tall Ship. Sail Training International has created a bursary scheme in partnership with the Sultanate of Oman to provide opportunites to trainees who need additional support.*

*The Sultanate of Oman Bursary Scheme is available to any young person (aged between 16-25) regardless of background, physical ability or sailing experience.*

*The scheme was trialled at The Tall Ships Races 2011 which saw 25 trainees from seven countries take part in the final race leg from Stavanger, Norway to Halmstad, Sweden. Some trainees were experiencing sailing for the first time.*

*Oman has a long-standing relationship with events organised by Sail Training International and a commitment to youth development. The name of the Navy of Oman’s own ship, Shabab Oman, means ‘Youth of Oman’ and the ship has won our presitgious International Friendship Trophy no fewer than eight times! A huge achievement as the trophy is decided via a secret ballot voted by Captains.*
