The Norwegian firm [Lade AS](http://www.ladeas.no/index.html) is developing a hybrid ship design, [Vindskip](http://www.ladeas.no/about.html), in which the ship sails using lift off its airfoil shaped hull. It is an intriguing design. Nevertheless, I can’t quite figure out how it would work in practice. It appears that since the hull itself is acting as the “sail” the only way to trim the “sail” for differing wind conditions is to change course in relation to the wind. Perhaps I am missing something.
