![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Oman-women-1_0.jpg)I will admit to not knowing much about Oman. I know that it is a Sultanate. It exports oil. I can find it on the map on the south-east corner of the Arabian peninsula. One thing that I do know is that it has a rather remarkable sailing program.

The Omani national sail training ship *[Shabab Oman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabab_Oman)* is highly thought of in the sail training community. Under the command of [Captain Christopher Biggins](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/04/commander-christopher-biggins-captain-of-the-omani-sail-training-ship-shabab-oman/), who died last year, *Shabab Oman* became well known as an extremely friendly ship, and as a result she won ‘The Cutty Sark Trophy’ a record four times, and its successor ‘[The Sail Training International Friendship Trophy](http://www.sailtraininginternational.org/events/race-trophies-and-awards)‘ another three times.  Last year the Sultanate of Oman began providing funding for up to [100 tall ship sail trainees yearly](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/08/25/funding-available-for-100-young-sail-trainees-yearly/), with a focus on young people who are who are financially disadvantaged or with a physical disability.

In more modern sailing, Omani men have been increasingly active in international competitions. As of October, the state sponsored [Oman Sail enrolled 40 women](http://www.omansail.com/page/Womens-Sailing-Programme) in a sailing program. Omani women are now competing in international sailboat races and may soon be [competing in Olympic sailing events.](http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/17/travel/oman-women-sailing/index.html)  
  
From this first group in the Omani Women’s Sailing Programme was recruited the all-women Al Thuraya Bank Muscat sailing team, which raced in February’s [Sailing Arabia – the Tour 2012](http://www.sailingarabiathetour.com/). The race included nine teams competing aboard Farr30 and M34 one-designs in both offshore events and around the buoys. Leading the Al Thuraya Bank Muscat team were Western professional sailors including the formidable British Vendée Globe veteran [Dee Caffari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_Caffari) and U.S. Volvo Ocean Race veteran Katie Pettibone. Also joining the team was [Suzanne Al Houby](http://www.thenational.ae/sport/other-sport/arab-mountaineer-inspires-omani-all-female-crew-to-scale-high-point), the first Arab woman to climb Mount Everest.
