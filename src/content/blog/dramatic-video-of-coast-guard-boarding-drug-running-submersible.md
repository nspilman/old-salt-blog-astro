Here is an amazing short video of the US Coast Guard overtaking and boarding a drug-running submersible. A Coast Guardsman is seen leaping aboard the submersible while underway and forcing the hatch open to apprehend the smugglers. The capture took place in the Eastern Pacific by the [USCG *Cutter Munro*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Munro_\(WMSL-755\)). The smuggling craft was carrying 17,000 pounds of cocaine with an estimated street value of $232 million.

The video shows not only the incredible courage and skill required to board the moving submersible but also how difficult these specialized smuggling craft are to spot while underway in the ocean.
