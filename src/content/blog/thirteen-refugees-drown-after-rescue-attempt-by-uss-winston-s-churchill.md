![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/09/Refugees-on-skiff-in-Gulf.jpg)Given all the reporting on piracy off the Horn of Africa, we hear very little about another crisis – the flood of refugees fleeing the instability and chaos of Somalia’s clan wars.  Last year 74,000 people crossed the Gulf of Aden in smugglers’ boats to reach Yemen, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.

On Monday the *[USS Winston S. Churchill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Winston_S._Churchill_\(DDG-81\))* attempted to render aid to an overloaded skiff drifting in the Gulf of Aden with 85 refugees from Somalia and Ethiopia.   The skiff’s engine had broken down.  According to a [statement released by the Navy](http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=56227):  
  
*At 8:30 local Sept. 27, while transferring humanitarian supplies to the skiff, the passengers rushed to one side and the skiff began taking on water, quickly capsizing and sinking rapidly, leaving all 85 passengers in the water. Winston S. Churchill immediately began conducting search and rescue operations using an additional RHIB assisted by an Australian maritime patrol aircraft.*

*Despite the effort, approximately 13 passengers drowned, while 61 passengers were rescued and brought safely on board Winston S. Churchill. Eight passengers have been listed as missing.*
