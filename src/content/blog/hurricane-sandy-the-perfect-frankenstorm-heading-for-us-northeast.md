![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sandytrack.jpg)As Hurricane Sandy works its way north, it is possible that it will join with a nor’easter to form what meteorologists are referring to as a “Frankenstorm,” a [superstorm that could slam into the US Northeast](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/us/east-coast-keeps-a-watchful-eye-on-hurricane-sandy.html?hp) causing damage projected to be larger than that of last year’s Hurricane Irene, which totaled in the billions of dollars.  “*We’re not trying to hype it,*” National Weather Service meterologist Paul Kocin tells [Bloomberg News](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/u-s-east-from-washington-to-nyc-at-risk-from-hurricane-sandy.html). “*What we’re seeing in some of our models is a storm at an intensity that we have not seen in this part of the country in the past century.*” [Hurricane Sandy has already killed 41 people](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/weather/weather-blog/sns-rt-us-storm-sandy-hurricanebre89n16j-20121024,0,6546083.story) as it passed across the Caribbean. Hurricane Sandy is expected to come ashore in the Northeast on Monday or Tuesday.

This weather pattern is the first seen since 1991, when a nor’easter and Hurricane Grace collided to form what meteorologists referred to as the “[Perfect Storm.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Perfect_Storm)”   The storm did $200 million (1991 USD)in damage and killed 13. Among the dead were the crew of the swordfishing boat, *Andrea Gail*. An account of the sinking of the *Andrea Gail* would later become a [book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perfect_Storm_\(book\)) and a [movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perfect_Storm_\(film\)), both of which were tiled “*The Perfect Storm.*”
