It was a classic contest between David and Goliath.  On May 27, 1941, the German battleship *[Bismark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_battleship_Bismarck)* had just sunk the pride of the Royal Navy, the *HMS Hood.* As she was close to escaping into safe waters, she was attacked by a swarm of obsolete [Fairey Swordfish biplanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairey_Swordfish) launched from the carrier *[HMS Ark Royal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Ark_Royal_\(1914\))*.   Lt-Cdr Bobby Lawson, one of the Swordfish pilots,  recently died at 91.

*Lieutenant-Commander Bobby Lawson, who has died aged 91, attacked the German battleship Bismarck only hours after she had sunk the battlecruiser Hood, the pride of the British fleet.*

*At about midnight on May 24 1941, Lawson was piloting a Swordfish over the North Atlantic. His was one of nine aircraft from 825 Naval Air Squadron sent to attack* *Bismarck**, which earlier that day had sunk* *Hood**, with the loss of all but three of the 1,418 crew.*

*Led by Lieutenant-Commander Eugene Esmonde, Lawson and his fellow pilots had flown from the new fleet carrier* *Victorious**. They were inexperienced; Lawson had made his first deck landing only five days earlier, and the squadron had not practised a formation attack.*
