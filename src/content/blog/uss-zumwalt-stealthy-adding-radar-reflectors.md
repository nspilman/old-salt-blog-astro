![zumwalt1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zumwalt1.jpg)The Navy’s newest destroyer, the $7.5 billion [USS *Zumwalt,*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/12/uss-zumwalt-ddg-1000-largest-usn-destroyer-on-sea-trials/) is designed to be stealthy. The ship is intended to be 50 times harder to detect on radar than current destroyers thanks to its angular shape and other design features. This is turning out to be a problem. The ship is now undergoing sea trial and testing off the often foggy coast of Maine.  She is apparently very difficult for local boats to spot.

[Lawrence Pye, a lobsterman, told The Associated Press](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a41a43bed22349238ec1f91f776445e1/how-stealthy-navys-new-destroyer-it-needs-reflectors) that on his radar screen the 610-foot ship looked like a 40- to 50-foot fishing boat. He watched as the behemoth came within a half-mile while returning to shipbuilder Bath Iron Works. “It’s pretty mammoth when it’s that close to you,” Pye said.

So, what is to be done? [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/the-new-zumwalt-stealth-destroyer-is-too-stealthy-1770458856) is reporting that the Navy plans to install removable radar reflectors to avoid wreaking havoc on local mariners.
