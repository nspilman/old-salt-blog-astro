As we have [posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=Mary+A.+Whalen) before, [PortSide New York](http://portsidenewyork.org/), based on the historic coastal tanker, *[Mary A.Whalen](http://www.portsidenewyork.org/mary_whalen.htm),*  is one of the absolutely best waterfront educational organizations in New York harbor.  For the last six years, the *Mary A. Whalen* has never had a permanent home.  Now it needs to find one by April 30th.  If not, the old tanker may be scrapped.

*Portside New York has been working for the past several years to secure a permanent port, but the process is slow and money is running out. The Mary Whalen must be moved by April 30. Organizers are confident that once a location is found, money will not be an issue.*

*“We will earn money rapidly once we have a place, and be able to raise money rapidly,” Portside New York’s Carolina Salguero said. “But without those things, we’re penned up in a place where we can’t do.”*

*One of the most successful events held on the Mary Whalen was four sold-out performances of a Puccini opera back in 2007. Those involved say it was really something special.*

*“There’s something absolutely magical about putting water together with music,” opera stage director Beth Greenberg said. “Things happen. Great things happen. Singers loved it. Singers loved performing on it. The audience loved it. And on a summer’s evening in New York City, what a great cultural entertainment.”*

*One location under consideration is the pier at Brooklyn Bridge park. The Mary Whalen is small enough to fit, and with running and bike trails and a playground, there are plenty of daily visitors who would frequent the floating museum.*
