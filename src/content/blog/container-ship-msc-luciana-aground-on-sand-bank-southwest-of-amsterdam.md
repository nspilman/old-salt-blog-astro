If you think that you are having a bad Monday morning, consider the plight of the master of the container ship *[MSC Luciana](http://shipping-data.com/ship/msc-luciana)*. The ship was bound from Antwerp to Felixstowe when it ran aground on a sand bar in the Westerschelde, the sea-channel that connects the port of Antwerp with the North Sea, about 140 kilometres (87 miles) southwest of Amsterdam. The *MSC Luciana* is one of the larger container ships in the world at 1,200 feet long and a container capacity of 11,600 TEU.   The ship reportedly ran aground at high tide. Zeeland Region Safety’s Aart Oosten is quoted as commenting, *“She is well and truly stuck and we are also going into low tide, causing further difficulties.  At the moment, we have several groups including the Dutch maritime authorities in a meeting to see how we will proceed,”* Oosten said, adding the Panamanian-registered ship posed no immediate danger to the environment. *“There is no danger and her crew remains on board,” he said.”*
