![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/01/HMSVictory_1799444c.jpg)This May will be the 250th anniversary of the launching of [*HMS Victory*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Victory), the 104-gun first-rate Royal Navy ship of the line best known as Lord Nelson’s flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.  *HMS Victory* was also Keppel’s flagship at Ushant in 1778, Howe’s flagship at Cape Spartel in 1782 and Jervis’s flagship at Cape St Vincent in 1797. Since 1922, the ship has been in No. 2 dock at Portsmouth, UK.  Four years ago, [a maintenance report concluded](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/archaeology/8247770/HMS-Victory-rotting-and-being-pulled-apart-under-its-own-weight.html) that the historic ship was riddled with rot and being pulled apart by its own weight.  Since then, the problems have persisted.

This week, the BBC reported that *[HMS Victory is ‘slowly rotting away from the inside’](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-30926084).  
*The [Portsmouth News](http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/defence/restorers-face-last-chance-to-preserve-hms-victory-1-6500146#.VKlhy6bGn5k.mailto) reports that this may be last chance to save the ship.  “*Andrew Baines, curator at the [National Museum of the Royal Navy](http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/) and project director of HMS Victory, said they face a battle to maintain the ship as she is. He said: ‘We are probably at the last opportunity to truly save the ship and make sure that significant historic material is going to survive in her.’ Since taking ownership of Victory in 2012, the museum has taken a slow approach to the work, as fears grow this is the final chance of a project this size can be done on the timber ship.*“
