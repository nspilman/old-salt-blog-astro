![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/whiteswan1.jpg)While under tow in the Guayas River, near Guayaquil, Ecuador, the 250′ long Brazilian sail training ship [*Cisne Branco*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisne_Branco) was carried sideways in the current into a pedestrian bridge that connects Guayaquil to Santay Island. The sailing ship damaged its rigging, resulting in the dismasting of the fore t’gallast mast in the allision.

An Ecuadoran naval tug sent to assist the *Cisne Branco* was subsequently caught sideways in the river current and capsized. Fortunately, the tug crew was reported to be rescued without injury. Likewise, no injuries were reported on the sail training ship or the other tug involved in the accident.

A statement by the Brazilian Navy says that the “*Cisne Branco* is safely anchored, pending the availability of a dock for mooring in Guayaquil, where the material conditions will be assessed in more detail.”

This was not the first accident involving the pedestrian bridge. According to [El Universo](https://www.eluniverso.com/guayaquil/comunidad/buque-se-impacta-contra-tramo-de-puente-peatonal-que-une-guayaquil-con-la-isla-santay-nota/), at least three accidents with boats have been registered on that bridge since 2017, the first one ended with the collapse of a 145-meter span. Likewise, there was another incident on the bridge in mid-2018.

The *Cisne Branco,* meaning *White Swan* in Portuguese, was [built in 1998 to commemorate the 500th anniversary](https://remonews.com/brazileng/jewel-of-the-brazilian-navy-the-cisne-branco-sailboat-crashes-into-a-pedestrian-bridge-in-ecuador-watch-the-videos/) of the discovery of Brazil, and, according to the Navy, its mission is “to represent Brazil in national and international nautical events, spread the maritime mentality and preserve naval traditions”. It is considered to be one of the most beautiful, well-equipped, and well-maintained ships in the Navy. Its sister ship is [*Stad Amsterdam*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stad_Amsterdam).
