Last March we posted “[Will Prince Albert of Monaco Save Cousteau’s Calypso?](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/03/will-prince-albert-of-monaco-save-cousteaus-calypso/)”  sadly, the answer to the question appears to be, “no.”  Earlier in March, following  a long legal battle, [a French court ruled](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/03/cousteaus-calypso-in-peril/), that Francine Cousteau, the second wife of the late Jacques Cousteau, owed €273,000 in shipyard bills and was required to remove the RV *Calypso* from a Brittany shipyard.  If she failed to do so the shipyard would be allowed to sell the 43 meter wooden research vessel. Shortly thereafter, rumors began to spread that Prince Albert II of Monaco might rescue the ship and bring it to the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco where Jacques Cousteau served as director for more than three decades, from 1957 to 1988.  These rumors appear to have been unfounded. The *Calypso* has not moved and appears to be in the first stages of being broken up. As reported by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/world/europe/once-a-beloved-french-symbol-a-ship-now-rusts-into-oblivion.html):

*Today, the Calypso rots in the warehouse where it was brought to be repaired in 2007. Stripped of the metal and wood that once encased it, weeds curling among the wooden beams of its frame, the ship is now a symbol of how Mr. Cousteau has faded in the collective memory and how despite France’s sailing tradition, neither the government nor his heirs have found a solution for its restoration….*

*Still in use in 1996, the Calypso was in the Singapore harbor when a barge accidentally rammed into it, sinking the boat to the seafloor. It took days to bring it to the surface and much longer to bring it back to France.*

*Although the Cousteau Society, a nonprofit environmental organization founded by the explorer, set out to restore it after Mr. Cousteau’s death, there have been lawsuits and disputes that have left the boat’s wooden frame weathering and its famous false nose with an underwater chamber rusting away.*

*“It is depressing to see that no one has come to be its patron,” said Pascale Bladier-Chassaigne, the managing director of the Association for Maritime and Fluvial Patrimony, describing the ship as “mythic” and “emblematic” for France.*

*In 2014, the association designated the Calypso as part of the country’s maritime cultural heritage, but it has yet to be considered a national monument by the state, which would give it a chance to compete for preservation funding.*
