The 113 years old topsail schooner [*Kathleen and May*](http://www.kathleenandmay.co.uk/), now berthed in Liverpool, may be on her way Asia, unless money can be raised from a local source to keep the retired merchant schooner in Great Britain. The schooner was the first ship to be listed on the [National Historic Ships Register](http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/register/146/kathleen-and-may).  There is currently a bid on the old ship by an unnamed Asian source for £ 2.3 million.  The owner, Steve Clarke, has been forced to sell the schooner due to declining health.
