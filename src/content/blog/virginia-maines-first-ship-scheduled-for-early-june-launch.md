Pinnace Virginia, Image: Maine’s First Ship

A reconstruction of the pinnace [*Virginia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_\(pinnace\)) is nearing completion after being under construction for over a decade in Bath, Maine. [The original 51-foot pinnace](https://mfship.org/home/virginia/), built in 1607 by the Popham Colony at its settlement at the mouth of the Kennebec River, was the first English ocean-going ship built in the Americas. If all goes well, the new *Virginia* will be launched into the Kennebec River on June 4th.

The [new *Virginia*’s keel was laid in 2011](https://www.pressherald.com/2022/03/07/maines-first-ship-plans-for-june-launch-after-a-decade-of-work/#coral_talk_stream), said [Maine’s First Ship](https://mfship.org/) Executive Director, Kirstie Truluck. Research, planning and construction, however, dates back to 1994 when the remains of the [Popham Colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popham_Colony) were discovered at the southernmost end of Phippsburg.

Before the vessel is launched, Truluck said to the [Portland Press Herald](https://www.pressherald.com/2022/03/07/maines-first-ship-plans-for-june-launch-after-a-decade-of-work/#coral_talk_stream) that building crews will still need to complete the electrical and navigation systems, finish painting, and build the remainder of the dock systems. The reconstruction will also be equipped with a motor.

Once in the water, crews will need to finish the pinnace’s rigging and get the vessel certified by the Coast Guard before it can set sail. Truluck estimated the *Virginia* could be completed in summer 2023.

Truluck noted the original *Virginia* was built in about four months without modern tools, but the shipbuilders’ livelihood depended on finishing the vessel. The reconstruction, on the other hand, has been built by an ever-changing army of volunteers. The pandemic also pushed back the schedule.

“The reason it has taken so long is it has been a process of getting volunteers and then getting the material – some through donations and some through purchase when the resource was there,” said Truluck. “It has been a classically Maine project of Yankee ingenuity, problem-solving, and the kindness of strangers. Those have been the resources to get this ship built, and to me, that’s the greatest part of the story.”
