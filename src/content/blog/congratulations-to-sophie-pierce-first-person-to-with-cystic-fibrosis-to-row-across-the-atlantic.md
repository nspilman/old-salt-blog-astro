Sophie Pierce did not believe she would live until she was 30 due to cystic fibrosis, a genetic illness affecting her ability to breathe. Remarkably, she has just completed a world record-breaking row, at age 32, becoming the first person with the condition to row the Atlantic.

As part of [Cruising Free](https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/news/team-cruising-free-take-on-the-atlantic-ocean), a team of four women rowers from Neyland Rowing Club, Pembrokeshire, she set off on a 3200-mile unsupported row across the Atlantic from Lanzarote in the Canary Islands to Antigua in the Caribbean as part of the [Atlantic Dash 2025](https://www.atlanticdash.com/atlantic-dash-2025-crew).

Ms Pierce said the 53-day journey had been “incredibly tough” but “empowering”.  
“If you had told me five years ago that I would be standing here in Antigua after rowing an ocean, I would have laughed,” Ms Pierce said.

Speaking to [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62k2k0k3n2o) Radio Wales Drive, she added: “Arriving at the finish line was the most incredible feeling I’ve ever experienced. 

“I hope this challenge not only inspires others with cystic fibrosis to push boundaries but also helps reimagine the future.”

Ms Pierce was not the only record breaker on the team. Janine Williams, 70,  also smashed the world record becoming the oldest person to row the ocean, and said it had been “an adventure of a lifetime”.

“People kept asking if I was worried about rowing at 70, but I never doubted we could do it. You’re never too old to take on something extraordinary,” she said.

She added it was “one of the hardest things” she had ever done, but credited teamwork with getting them to dry land.

They were also joined by Polly Zipperlen, 50, and Miyah Periam, 24, and have raised £20,000 for  Cystic Fibrosis Trust, Emily’s Entourage, and Paul Sartori, Hospice at Home.
