![cathayer](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cathayer.jpg)Last week, the 1895 lumber schooner *[C.A. Thayer](http://www.nps.gov/safr/learn/historyculture/c-a-thayer.htm)*, the last surviving West Coast lumber schooner, [returned to her berth](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Historic-San-Francisco-Schooner-Returns-to-Glory-370191681.html?_osource=SocialFlowFB_BAYBrand) at [San Francisco Maritime](http://www.nps.gov/safr/index.htm)‘s Hyde Street Pier, after having three masts and a bowsprit installed by the Bay Ship and Yacht Company of Alameda. Her previous masts were removed over twenty years ago. C.A.Thayer was also drydocked and painted during her time in the yard. She also received new booms and gaffs. (Thanks to Doug Faunt for the update.)

Over the next sixth months riggers at the Maritime National Historic Park will complete rigging the schooner to carry a new set of sails, now being cut and sewn by a San Diego sailmaker. “*The idea is to have a completely authentic 1895 lumber schooner capable for sailing*,” said Jeff Morris, the National Park’s Historic Ships Manager.
