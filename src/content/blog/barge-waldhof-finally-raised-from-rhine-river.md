![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/loreley_tanker_fullSize_1.jpg)The tank barge *Waldhof* which capsized a month ago in the Rhine River near Lorelei Rock  was finally raised today after its cargo of sulfuric acid was allowed to slowly drain off.   Two sailors where lost in the capsize. One of the bodies was found inside the barge cabin.    The second sailor remains missing and is presumed drowned.  The barge has now been towed to a safe harbor close by.   The capsized barge has severely restricted commercial travel on the Rhine River, Europe’s busiest inland water way.
