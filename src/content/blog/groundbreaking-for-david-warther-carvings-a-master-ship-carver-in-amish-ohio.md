Between Sugarcreek and Walnut Creek, Ohio, in the heart of Amish country,Ohio, there was a ground-breaking today for a new museum which will showcase ship models carved by David Warther II, a fifth generation carver.  [David Warther Carvings](http://www.warther.org/?page=building) will showcase Warther’s “History of the Sailing Ship” which follows the development of ships from early Egyptian times to the end of the Age of Sail. Thus far Warther has carved 80 ship models, primarily in legal ivory, purchased from museums and private owners.

*Construction of the $1.25 million facility showcasing the “History of the Sailing Ship” could begin Thursday, and he expects the carving exhibit to open in May 2013. Warther’s passion is carving sailing ships.* 

*When asked why ships, he replied, “Somebody already carved all the trains.” That, of course, was “Mooney,” whose carvings are displayed at Warther Carvings museum in Dover.*

*“I started carving ships when I was 6 years old, and I’ve been making them ever since,” said David, 53. “I was drawn to the beauty of ships, and when I got older I wanted to focus on something with a lot of historical relevance, and nothing has more of that than ships.* 

*“I’m a history buff. Ships date back to 4,000 B.C., but for the first 1,000 years we don’t know what they looked like. We do know about their appearance at 3,000 B.C. because the Egyptians were such good record keepers.”* 

*He recalls being “extremely excited when I carved my first ship at age 6. It may sound strange, but even when I was a kid I knew that’s what I wanted to do. Fortunately, my dad (Dave) and grandfather made a big fuss and spurred me on. I didn’t know how it would work out, but it has worked out quite well.”* 

*These days, David is finishing his 80th ship – one from the Viking era and Normandy in 1,000 A.D. His lifetime goal is 100. The carvings depict only “ships under sail,” just as his grandfather focused primarily on steam locomotive trains and the history of steam power.*
