![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/christmastreecluster.jpg)Merry Christmas! Here is a composite image and video of NGC 2264, also known as the “[Christmas Tree Cluster](https://www.space.com/christmas-tree-cluster-twinkling-lights-chandra-x-ray-observatory),” that shows the shape of a cosmic tree with the glow of stellar lights.

According to [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/telescopes-illuminate-christmas-tree-cluster/):  NGC 2264 is, in fact, a cluster of young stars — with ages between about one and five million years old — in our Milky Way about 2,500 light-years away from Earth. The stars in NGC 2264 are both smaller and larger than the Sun, ranging from some with less than a tenth of the mass of the Sun to others containing about seven solar masses.

This new composite image enhances the resemblance to a Christmas tree through choices of color and rotation. The blue and white lights (which blink in the animated version of this image) are young stars that give off X-rays detected by NASA’s [Chandra X-ray Observatory](https://chandra.harvard.edu/index.html). Optical data from the National Science Foundation’s [WIYN 0.9-meter telescope on Kitt Peak](https://www.wiyn.org/) shows gas in the nebula in green, corresponding to the “pine needles” of the tree, and infrared data from the [Two Micron All Sky Survey](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/2mass.html) shows foreground and background stars in white. This image has been rotated clockwise by about 160 degrees from the astronomer’s standard of North pointing upward, so that it appears like the top of the tree is toward the top of the image.
