![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/11/admholloway.jpg)[Admiral James Holloway III](https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/histories/biographies-list/bios-h/holloway-james-l.html) has died at the age of 97. He had dementia, said his daughter Jane Holloway, and “finally got to landing on that great big carrier in the sky.”

Seventy-five years ago, on October 25, 1944, Holloway served as a gunnery officer on the destroyer *Bennion*. During the [Battle of Surigao Strait](http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_surigao_strait.html), his ship scored a direct torpedo hit at point-blank range to help sink the battleship *Yamashiro*, sank the Japanese destroyer *Asagumo* with gunfire, and shot down three Zeros.

Over James Holloway’s 36-year Navy career, he would also fly fighter jets in Korea and command the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Promoted to Rear Admiral in 1970, he would command the U.S. Seventh Fleet, directing more than 150 ships in bombing operations against North Vietnam.

Admiral Holloway became the Navy’s top-ranking officer on July 1, 1974, and served as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. The son of an admiral and the husband of an admiral’s daughter, he was known throughout the service as a battle-hardened sailor and aviator. According to the Naval History and Heritage Command, the Holloways were the only father-son duo to become four-star admirals while on active duty.

Admiral Holloway received military honors including two Defense Distinguished Service Medals, four Navy Distinguished Service Medals, two Legion of Merit awards, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star and three Air Medals.

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/james-holloway-decorated-aviator-and-navys-former-top-admiral-dies-at-97/2019/11/28/26e8990c-1171-11ea-9cd7-a1becbc82f5e_story.html) reports that he was survived by his wife of 77 years, the former Dabney Rawlings of Alexandria; two daughters, Lucy Lyon of Bonita Springs, Fla., and Jane Holloway of Washington; and a grandson. His son, James L. Holloway IV, died in a 1964 car crash while studying at the University of Virginia.
