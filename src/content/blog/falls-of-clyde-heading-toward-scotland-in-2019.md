[![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/focfigurehead-1.jpg)Save-the-Falls of Clyde International](https://www.facebook.com/savefallsofclyde/) has made a dramatic announcement on their Facebook page suggesting that transport has been arranged to carry the four-masted, full-rigged, iron ship from Hawaii back to the Clyde River in Scotland, where it was built in 1878.  

“*After many months of negotiation, a deal has finally agreed between this group and Sevenstar Yacht Transfer, to collect the ‘Falls of Clyde’. She will be loaded onboard their flo/flo ship, ‘Yacht Express ‘ during the week 3rd February 2019. She will visit San Diego, Costa Rico, Florida, and New York during her way home to Scotland, arriving April 2019.*”

An ongoing [IndieGogo crowdfunding campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/save-falls-of-clyde-campaign?fbclid=IwAR2TWFJA6vUnHJzMh1xmGzJfc8v0e15a9xs_bK6WDiMDCRFNCnwTyeU4DgE#/) is underway to help fund the transport of the ship back to Scotland. It is unclear whether the funding to charter the heavy-lift ship is in place or dependant of future crowdfunding and other fundraising. No doubt more details will be forthcoming.
