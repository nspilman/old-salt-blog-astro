(See our previous post: [Building the Viking Longboat Dragon Harald Fairhair](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/14/building-the-viking-longboat-dragon-harald-fairhair/))  Built of oak, in the town of Haugesund in Western Norway, the ship is hundred and fourteen feet, twenty-seven feet wide, displacing seventy tons, and will carry thirty-two hundred square feet of sail.  This week the longship was rolled stern first from the fabrication shop closer to the launch ways to be be tarred.  Launching is expected in June.  Thanks to [Marit Synnøve Vea](http://https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=590992793) for posting the photos on Facebook.
