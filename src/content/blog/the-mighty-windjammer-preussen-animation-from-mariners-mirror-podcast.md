Here is an animation from a [Mariner’s Mirror podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@marinersmirrorpodcast) about perhaps the greatest windjammer of the early twentieth century, the *[Preussen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preussen_\(ship\)).* One of the [Flying P-Liners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner), built for the F. Laeisz shipping company in 1902, she was the only five-masted full-rigged steel ship ever built at that time. She remains one of only two five-masted full-rigged ships ever built. The second such ship, the Star Clipper’s  [*Royal Clipper*](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/01/royal-clipper-not-always-obvious-technology-behind-modern-clipper-ship/), launched in 2000, was inspired by the *Preussen.*

The animation is designed to go alongside [an episode of the Mariner’s Mirror Podcast in which Dr Sam Willis speaks with Frank Scott](https://shows.acast.com/the-mariners-mirror-podcast/episodes/iconic-ships-19-preussen), a retired naval aviator and qualified square rig ship-master, who commanded various square riggers ranging from 80 to 800 gross tonnes. In his long sail training career he served in fourteen square riggers, under seven different national flags.
