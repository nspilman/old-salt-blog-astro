![expeditionrowboat](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/expeditionrowboat.jpg)We recently posted [Pedaling on the Water](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/10/pedaling-water-baycycle-shuttle-bike-akwakat-hobie-mirage/) which featured various versions of frames with inflatable pontoons on which one could bolt a bicycle and pedal across the water.   I recently came across a very different take on traveling by boat and bicycle. The [Angus Expedition rowboat](http://angusrowboats.com/expedition.html) has enough capacity to allow the rower to carry along a full sized bicycle and a break-apart boat trailer. I love the idea of of pedaling to the water with a  boat in tow, rowing across a wide river or bay and then pedaling off on the other side.  Julie and Colin Angus towed their Expedition rowboats behind bicycles for over 3,000 km across Europe.  The Expedition rowboat can also be loaded with supplies for making long passages. Julie and Colin rowed these boats 7,000 km from Scotland to Syria.  The video, below, shows how it is done.  The [Expedition rowboat and other boats Angus boats](http://angusrowboats.com/boats.html) are available as kits.

[Julie and Colin are a remarkable couple](http://www.angusadventures.com/).  Collectively they have rowed more than 40,000 km in a variety of oar-powered craft on oceans, rivers and lakes. They were jointly named [National Geographic’s 2007 Adventurer of the Year](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/best-of-adventure-2007/achievements/adventurers-of-year.html), for completing the first human-powered circumnavigation of the globe. In 2009, Julie Angus made history by becoming the first woman to row across the Atlantic Ocean from mainland to mainland. Colin is the first to row across the Bering Sea from Alaska to Siberia, and he has also voyaged by oar down the length of the Amazon and Yenisey Rivers.
