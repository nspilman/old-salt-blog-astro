A [heartwarming story](https://www.theinertia.com/environment/sperm-whale-asks-divers-for-help-removing-trash-tangled-in-its-mouth/) for a Monday.  Here is a short video of a sperm whale in the Indian Ocean that approached a group of divers, seemingly asking for help.

The whale swam directly up to them, mouth agape and dragging all sorts of detritus caught in its jaw. When the diver cautiously approached it, it left its mouth open and allowed her to pluck the tangled pile out, piece by piece.

Afterwards, the whale remained in the area for a while, staying at the surface with the divers as though it was saying thank you. Before it disappeared into the depths again, the divers were treated to a photoshoot of a lifetime and a memory that will last forever.
