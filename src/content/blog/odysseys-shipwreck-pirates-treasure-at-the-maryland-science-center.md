A new exhibition opened at the at the [Maryland Science Center](http://www.mdsci.org/), [Odyssey’s Shipwreck! Pirates & Treasure](http://www.mdsci.org/exhibits/Shipwreck.html), that will run through January 30, 2011.

[Exploring pirates and shipwrecks at the Maryland Science Center](http://www.examiner.com/family-entertainment-in-baltimore/pirates-invade-the-maryland-science-center)  
  
*Odyssey’s Shipwreck! Pirates & Treasure examines the science of marine archeology as well as pirate history and lore. You will learn about the [SS Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Republic_\(1853\)), which sank after Civil War in 1865. The ship has the distinction of being built in Baltimore. There is information about other ships including the [Black Swan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_Project).*

*[Odyssey Marine Exploration](http://www.shipwreck.net/) has recovered over 14,000 artifacts and 50,000 gold and silver coins. The artifacts according to the Maryland Science Center include, “a wealth of mid-19th century trade goods hidden on the ocean floor for over a century. Coins, bottles, personal effects, on-board items, and pieces of the vessel are on display in the exhibit”.*

*Odyssey’s Shipwreck! Pirates & Treasure features many interactive and hands-on activities. Experience the 75mph wind tunnel, and stand in hurricane force winds. Pilot a submersible during a virtual recovery mission. Even collect gold coins with a robotic arm.*

*Combining science and technology, the exhibit will educate Baltimore families about shipwreck recovery and history. Moreover, remember those rowdy pirates! So check out Odyssey’s Shipwreck! Pirates & Treasure at the Maryland Science Center from October 1, 2010 through January 30, 2011.*
