![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/tian-fu.jpg)After [spending two days in heavy seas](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/12/golden-globe-race-susie-goodalls-boat-pitchpoled-and-dismasted/), snap-rolling in her dismasted, leaking, sailboat, [Golden Globe](https://goldengloberace.com/) racer Susie Goodall was rescued by the Hong Kong-flagged geared cargo ship, MV*Tian Fu*, in the Southern Ocean approximately 2,000 miles west of Cape Horn.  Unable to get keep the engine running on the sailboat, *DHL Starlight, Goodall* set a sea anchor and was approached by the 38,000 DWT ship. The seas state made launching the ship’s rescue boat unsafe, so the ship’s personnel used one of the 4 ship’s deck cranes to lower a hook to Goodall, who attached her safety harness and was hoisted aboard.

The ship, [*Tian Fu*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:3727266/mmsi:477588500/imo:9704738/vessel:TIAN_FU), was sailing from China to Argentina when it was diverted to reach the distressed sailor. The ship’s name has a number of meanings. It is a geographical region and an acupuncture point. It can also mean “[heaven’s palace](https://www.hantrainerpro.com/tcm/chinese-english/translation-tianfu_lu3.htm).” After spending two days in the hell of a dismasted sailboat, the ship, no doubt feels like heaven’s palace to Susie Goodall.
