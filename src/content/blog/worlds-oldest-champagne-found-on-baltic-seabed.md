![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/07/champagne.jpg)Divers have found 30 bottles of champagne thought to pre-date the French Revolution on the Baltic seabed.  Reportedly, it was still highly drinkable.

All I can say is that the seabed must be one hell of a wine cellar.   Dark, cold, but at a constant temperature, and totally devoid of oxygen – it does meet the requirements for storing alcohol.  The fact that the champagne was something other than vinegar is proof enough.

*When they opened one, they found the wine – believed to have been made by Clicquot (now Veuve Clicquot) between 1782 and 1788 – was still in good condition.*

*The bottle – whose shape indicates it was produced in the 18th Century – has now been sent to France for analysis.*

*If confirmed, it would be the oldest drinkable champagne in the world.*

*Diver Christian Ekstrom was exploring a shipwreck on the Baltic seabed when he found the bottles.*
