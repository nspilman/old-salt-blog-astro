*Maritime heritage will sail into the Inner Harbour at this year’s Victoria Classic Boat Festival.*

*Historical nautical vessels used for pleasure, transportation, fishing and missionary work from as early as the late 1800s will navigate their way to the Causeway floats.*

*“Victoria is really a hotbed of classic boats. We have thousands and thousands of marina berths in Victoria full of beautiful, beautiful old boats,” said festival chair Jamie Webb.*

*Between 75 to 100 classic boats will line the Inner Harbour Sept. 3-5 showing off the spirit and tradition of maritime history that the classic boat festival has worked to preserve for more than three decades.*
