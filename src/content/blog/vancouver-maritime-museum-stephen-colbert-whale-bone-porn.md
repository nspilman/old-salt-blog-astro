The [Vancouver Maritime Museum](http://www.vancouvermaritimemuseum.com/) has an exhibit which opened this month, [Tattoos & Scrimshaw: the Art of the Sailor,](http://www.vancouvermaritimemuseum.com/page161.htm) which has generated a surprising amount of controversy. It seems that some of the scrimshaw on display features explicit erotic scenes. Ann Pimentel, a Vancouver mother and schoolteacher, has complained vociferously, charging that some of the scrimsaw is “whale bone porn.” As reported by the [National Post](http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/03/23/museums-whale-bone-porn-leaves-vancouver-mother-extremely-disturbed-demands-its-removal/): “*Ironically, Ms. Pimentel’s one-woman crusade has created more interest in the VMM show than the museum could have mustered on its own*.”  Even Stephen Colbert has weighed in on the topic.

Thanks to Irwin Bryan for pointing out the story.
