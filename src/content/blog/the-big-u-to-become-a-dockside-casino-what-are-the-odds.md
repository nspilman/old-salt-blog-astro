They are two projects in trouble.  One is a group of ship enthusiasts trying to save the rusting hulk of an historic passenger liner and the other, an Indian tribe trying to save a long-delayed casino project.

Yesterday, the [SS United States Conservancy](http://ssunitedstatesconservancy.org/SSUS/blog/) proposed moving the *[SS United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States)* upriver to become part of the new Foxwoods/Harrah’s casino project on the Delaware River in Philadelphia.  So far, the casino group has shown no interest in the proposal, facing challenges and deadlines of its own.  
  
The problem is that the casino project,  which was originally intended to open in late 2008,  is facing a December 10th deadline to finalize agreements on financing and managing the $275 million casino and present them to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.  Thus far the casino group has not expressed an interest in considering a new proposal as they scramble to line up financing for the project. As reported by [Bloomberg](http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9JJ8DV00.htm):  *Foxwoods has faced daily fines of $2,000 — more than $700,000 to date — since failing to meet a Dec. 1, 2009, deadline imposed by the gaming board to provide information about its financing, design and construction.*
