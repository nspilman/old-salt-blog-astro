![kntraining](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kntraining-198x200.jpg)In January, we posted about [winter crew training classes for volunteer crew on the replica ship *Kalmar Nyckel.*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/01/delawares-tall-ship-kalmar-nyckel-seeks-volunteer-sailing-crew/)  The classes run for nine Saturdays between January and April.  At the time we didn’t ask where or how the training would take place. The announcement said only that the training would be at the “*NEW maintenance and Education facility at Kalmar Nyckel Shipyard*” in Wilmington, DE.   The [Kalmar Nyckel Foundation](http://www.kalmarnyckel.org/Index.asp) recently added [some photos on their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/kalmarnyckel/posts/1547686742152215), and all we can say is “wow.” Their new maintenance and education center is quite impressive. There are not too many places where one can set square sails indoors.  The new facility has to be especially welcome in the nasty winter we are having on the East Coast this year. Congratulations to the Kalmar Nyckel Foundation on what looks like a great training facility.  Go to their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/kalmarnyckel) to learn more.
