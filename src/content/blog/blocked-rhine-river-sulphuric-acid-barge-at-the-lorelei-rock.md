![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/539w.jpg)[Two floating cranes are now in place](http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2011/01/22/cranes_to_salvage_capsized_ship/) to begin salvaging the Waldhof,  a capsized 330 foot long tanker barge, loaded with 2,400 tonnes of sulfuric acid, which has blocked traffic on the Rhine River, Europe’s busiest inland water way, for over a week. A third crane is expected to arrive today and a fourth is expected next Tuesday.  The [river could remain closed](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14776590,00.html) to large ships for at least another 10 days.  The tanker barge capsized on January 13 near Lorelei Rock and has stranded nearly 250 ships.   The Waldhof has a [stainless steel double-hull](http://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3137:germany-to-study-allowing-limited-rhine-traffic-following-barges-sinking&catid=3:international-shipping-news&Itemid=63) designed to prevent its storage tanks from rupturing in case of an accident.

[Lorelei Rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorelei) marks the narrowest portion of the Rhine River and is noted for treacherous currents.   According to legend, the Lorelei is the home of a mermaid whose song lures sailor’s to their death. While often claimed to be part of ancient folklore, the origin of the tale appears to date from an 1801 poem by Clemens Brentano.
