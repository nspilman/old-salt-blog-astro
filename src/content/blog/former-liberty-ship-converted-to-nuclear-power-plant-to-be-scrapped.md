Did you know that in the 1960s the US Army converted a World War II Liberty ship to a floating nuclear power plant? Neither did I. And as it is now [heading for the scrap yard](https://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/local/floating-nuclear-plant-to-be-scrapped-in-brownsville/article_3d3256c8-baae-11e8-8388-d73e8d0a6258.html), will soon be no more.

In the early 60s, the US Army installed a 10 MW nuclear power plant in the World War II Liberty ship, SS [Charles H. Cugle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Charles_H._Cugle). The Liberty ship, renamed *Sturgis*, became a nuclear plant on a barge, designed to be towed where needed to provide electrical power. The *Sturgis* was deployed in Gatun Lake, between the Gatun Locks and the Chagris dam spillway in Panama to provide power to supplement the Gatun Hydroelectric Station, during a serious drought. Tellingly, the *Sturgis* was also assisted by a 20 MW conventional diesel-electric power plant on a barge, the *Andrew J. Weber*.

The *Sturgis* was retired from service in 1976 and ultimately moved to the James River Reserve Fleet. In 2015, the ship was moved to Galveston, Texas, where the dismantling of the reactor has been underway.

“[Environmental monitoring has been continuous since prior to the arrival of the *Sturgis* in Galveston](https://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/local/floating-nuclear-plant-to-be-scrapped-in-brownsville/article_3d3256c8-baae-11e8-8388-d73e8d0a6258.html) and no evidence of radioactive material, lead or increased radiation exposure from the Sturgis has been documented outside of the reactor containment area at any point during the project,” said Brenda Barber with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The project was originally expected to take 18 months to complete but was delayed when larger cranes were needed to be brought in to lift material from the vessel. The original contract estimated the project would cost about $35 million, but the delays and additional equipment increased the cost to $51 million.

The ship will be towed to Brownsville later this month and then scrapped.
