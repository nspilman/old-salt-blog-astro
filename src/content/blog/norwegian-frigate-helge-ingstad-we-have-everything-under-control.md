![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/11/nfrigategrounded2.jpg)How is it possible that the Norwegian frigate [*Helge Ingstad* collided with the Aframax tanker *Sola TS*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/11/tanker-collides-with-norwegian-frigate-frigate-loses/) in a fjord near a major oil terminal? The frigate is much smaller, significantly faster and far more maneuverable than the 113,00 DWT tanker laden with a full cargo of crude oil. Why did the naval officers on the frigate fail to avoid a collision?

It is too early to say. “This was a very serious accident and \[the authorities\] need the time to investigate,” said John Erik Hagen, regional director of the Norwegian Coastal Administration’s western region.

That being said, [Norwegian sources report](https://www.aldrimer.no/fregatten-anropt-og-advart-gjentatte-ganger/) that the Norwegian warship was repeatedly warned of its collision course with a Maltese oil tanker before the two ships hit each other around 4AM last Thursday. The two ships were reported to have seen each other and to have followed communication protocols on an open channel. After receiving collision warnings from both the tanker *Sola TS* and the Coastal Maritime Traffic Center Fedje VTS. The frigate responded, “[We have everything under control](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46150048).”

Following the collision, the frigate was intentionally grounded to prevent it from sinking. *Helge Ingstad* apparently only turned on her Automatic Identification System (AIS) transporter after the mishap had occurred.

As serious as the collision was, it could have been far worse. The collision between a weapons-laden warship and a fully loaded oil tanker could have potentially been catastrophic.
