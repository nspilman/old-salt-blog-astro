![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/01/whale-day-logo-for-site.jpg)Every year, around 26,000 gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) make the 10,000 mile journey from their feeding grounds in the Arctic Sea south to their breeding groups in the lagoons of Baja.  (For an interesting view of the migration see [Whale migration seen from the air](http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/jan/18/whale-migration-seen-air/))   Around this time of year, large numbers of gray whales pass right by San Diego, which is a fine excuse for a party. This Saturday, San Diego is celebrating the [4th Annual Big Bay Whale Days and Whale Festival](http://www.whaledays.com/) with food, music, crafts and exhibits from 11:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m.at the Port Pavilion on the Broadway Pier.  Thanks to Brad Holderman for pointing out the festival on Facebook.
