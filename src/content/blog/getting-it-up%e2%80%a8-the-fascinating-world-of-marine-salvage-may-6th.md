![gettingitup](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/gettingitup.jpg)This year, the [Working Harbor Committe](http://www.nycharities.org/events/EventLevels.aspx?ETID=7019)e’s annual spring program is “***Getting It Up!  The Fascinating World of Marine Salvage***” on Tuesday, May 6th at the Community Church of New York, 40 E. 35th Street, New York, NY 10016.  If you are anywhere near New York harbor, be sure to stop by.

From the Working Harbor Committee press release:

*Unfortunately, some ships come to grief. Witness the tragic sinking of the South Korean ferry Sewol on April 16, or the doomed cruise ship Costa Concordia that ended up on the rocks off Giglio, Italy in 2012.*

*When there is trouble on the water the marine salvage industry arrives with divers, engineers and some amazing expertise and heavy equipment to protect the environment and save what can be saved of the ship.*

*The nonprofit Working Harbor Committee of New York and New Jersey will present an evening program on May 6 that will showcase this little known, but vitally important, arm of the maritime industry with dramatic films of actual salvage operations and talks by some of the salty professionals who work in the industry.*

*The mission of the [Working Harbor Committee](http://workingharbor.com/) – a NYS not-for-profit organization – is to strengthen awareness of the working harbor’s history and vitality today, and its opportunities for the future, by involving people in learning how the harbor works and what it does, educating people in the rich and challenging history of the harbor, and making people aware of the need to build and sustain the working harbor. We accomplish this with our Hidden Harbor Tours (r) and other programs. Visit [www.workingharbor.org](http://workingharbor.com/)*
