STS Lord Nelson

The [tall ship *Lord Nelson*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS_Lord_Nelson) is being [offered for sale at an online auction](https://marineindustrynews.co.uk/tall-ship-lord-nelson-goes-auction/) by the global advisory and investment firm Gordon Brothers, acting on behalf of Richard Lewis and Sarah O’Toole, the joint administrators of [Jubilee Sailing Trust Limited](https://jst.org.uk/).

Jubilee Sailing Trust was forced into administration in August 2022, after one of the charity’s principal creditors ‘threatened imminent legal proceedings to reclaim their owed credit’, JST says.

The [JST has so far operated through its two subsidiarie](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-62714460)s, Jubilee Sailing Trust Ltd and Jubilee Sailing Trust (Tenacious) Ltd. Tall ship *Tenacious* remains operational, the charity has stressed.

*Lord Nelson* was built in 1985 and is the first tall ship in the world designed to accommodate personnel of all physical abilities to sail alongside the ship’s crew. The tall ship includes accessible toilets, a speaking compass, braille and a power-assisted bridge.

*Lord Nelson* was [decommissioned](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/07/update-jubilee-sailing-trust-jst-decommissioning-sts-lord-nelson/) in Bristol, UK in 2019.

The [online auction](https://www.bidspotter.co.uk/en-gb/auction-catalogues/gordonbrothers/catalogue-id-gordon10095) ends on 30 June 2023 at 2pm, with the opening bid set at £150,000.
