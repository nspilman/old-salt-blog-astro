![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/07/cannon-1.jpg)Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for pointing out this wonderful auction on EBay.  No bids yet but there are still five days left.   I would love to own these beauties but can’t figure out where I would put them or what I would do with them.  It would be awfully tempting to fire them from time to time.  Probably upset the neighbors.  Difficult to tell whether they are authentic.

*Incredible Revolutionary War and War of 1812 ships deck cannons. Letter of Provenance from the last family member to winning bidder. Been in the same family for almost 200 years. Consecutively Serial Numbered!! Almost impossible to find cannons of this pedigree today! These are in GREAT condition. Carriages were made sometime during the 1990’s and are oak. Each cannon weighs just under 300 pounds, 3 inch bore & 36 inches long. They are made from cast iron.*
