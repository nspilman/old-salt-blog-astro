[Questions Swirl About Damaged Japanese Tanker](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/world/middleeast/30ship.html?scp=1&sq=tanker%20star&st=cse)  
  
*Shipping officials said Thursday that they were examining the hull of a Japanese oil tanker that was mysteriously damaged this week as it traversed a strategically vital waterway between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula. The ship’s owner has said that it may have been attacked.*

*The company released photographs on Thursday showing a* [*large, square dent*](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE66S2BR20100729 "Article from Reuters") *in the black-and-red hull of the tanker and broken railings along its deck, damage that appears unlikely to have been caused by a wave. Photos of the interior show broken ceiling panels and exposed insulation and wiring in one of the dining rooms.*

*Theodore Karasik, a Dubai-based security analyst, said that the leading theory there was that an old mine was adrift and bumped the ship; if it had degraded, it could have simply produced a pressure blast. There are still mines in the region from the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Another possibility, he said, was a collision with another ship.*

*Moosa Murad, general manager of the Port of Fujairah, where the tanker docked on Wednesday, told Reuters that he suspected that the ship had been involved in a collision, perhaps with a submarine or sea mine, but added, “We don’t know what it was.”*
