![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/10/tbuoy.jpg)After the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that killed nearly a quarter of a million people, the United States, Germany, and Malaysia donated an advanced tsunami warning system to Indonesia. When the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia was hit by tsunami waves of up to 6 meters following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, [none of the 22 tsunami early warning buoys](https://nationalpost.com/news/world/none-of-the-22-buoys-are-functioning-tsunami-warning-system-might-have-saved-lives-in-indonesia) was working. Some have been damaged by vandals and others have been stolen. Reportedly, the system has not worked for at least the [last six years](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-01/indonesia-tsunami-early-detection-buoys-broken-for-six-years/10324200) due to a lack of funding.

Indonesia does have a tsunami early warning system, but it is limited in its capabilities. The nearest closest tsunami tidal gauge to Palu was over 200km away. Based data from this gauge the Indonesian authorities predicted a tsunami wave of from 0.5 to 3 meters high. 

[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45663054) reports, Indonesia’s tsunami early warning system is currently made up of a network of 170 seismic broadband stations, 238 accelerometer stations, and 137 tidal gauges.

But according to BMKG’s head of earthquake and tsunami center, the current system in place is “very limited”.

“Our \[current\] tools are very lacking,” said Rahmat Triyono, speaking to BBC Indonesian.

“In fact, of the 170 earthquake sensors we have, we only have a maintenance budget for 70 sensors.”

However we do know that the system did, in fact, pick up the tsunami – because a warning was sent out – but what it failed to do was accurately gauge the scale of the tsunami.

The number of people known to have died in Indonesia in Friday’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 1,347.
