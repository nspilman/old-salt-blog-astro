![lucybaggyw](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/07/lucybaggyw-200x110.jpg)I have long been a fan of Lucy Bellwood. A tall ship sailor and cartoonist; she is talented, smart and funny. Her  wonderful series, *[Baggywrinkles](http://lucybellwood.com/baggywrinkles/)*, based on the time she has spent working aboard replica 18th-century tall ships, has appeared an issue at a time online. She is now raising money via [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lucybellwood/baggywrinkes-a-lubbers-guide-to-life-at-sea?ref=nav_search) to publish the entire series, including new and as yet unseen work, as *[Baggywrinkles: A Lubber’s Guide to Life at Sea](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lucybellwood/baggywrinkes-a-lubbers-guide-to-life-at-sea?ref=nav_search)*.

Things are going well. Her goal was to raise to $15,000. As of this moment, with 20 days to go, she has raised over $18,000. If she reaches $20,000, she is promising to hire a colorist so that the entire book— six issues of comics—will be printed in full color. I have pledged my support and encourage others to do so as well. I am looking forward to seeing *Baggywrinkles: A Lubber’s Guide to Life at Sea,* in full color!
