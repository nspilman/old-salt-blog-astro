[Indonesia Says 217 Asylum Seekers Missing After Boat Sinks](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-18/indonesia-says-217-asylum-seekers-missing-after-boat-sinks.html)  
  
*The boat, with the capacity to carry 100 passengers, was overloaded with passengers from Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, the rescue agency said in a statement on its website.*

*Asylum seekers, usually from Middle Eastern countries, often pass through Indonesian waters as they try to reach Australia. The issue of boat people is a major political issue in Australia, highlighted in December last year when a wooden boat crammed with as many as 90 people crashed in heavy seas against the cliffs of Christmas Island, killing as many as 50 people on board.*

*The island lies about 1,600 miles (2,600 kilometers) northwest of Perth, the capital of Western Australia state.*
