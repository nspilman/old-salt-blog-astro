Cod Fish Relay Race

Boothbay is one of my favorite places on  the Maine coast. Sadly, I will not be anywhere near by this Friday, Saturday and Sunday, so I will miss the [39th Fisherman’s Festival.](http://chamber.boothbayharbor.com/events/details/fishermen-s-festival-2011-4131)   From the Shrimp Princess Pageant on Friday to the Cod Fish Relay and Bait Shoveling Races on Saturday to the blessing of the fleet on Sunday, it sounds like lots of good fun.
