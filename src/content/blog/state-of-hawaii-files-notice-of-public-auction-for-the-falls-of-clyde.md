![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/01/Falls_of_Clyde200.jpg)Even though it was expected, it still comes as a shock. Yesterday, the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) Harbors Division filed a [public notification](http://hidot.hawaii.gov/blog/2019/02/07/notice-of-public-auction-for-the-falls-of-clyde/?platform=hootsuite) that the historic windjammer, [*Falls of Clyde*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_of_Clyde_\(ship\)), is being offered for sale by auction. 

Those who wish to bid on the ship must [post a performance bond](https://hidot.hawaii.gov/harbors/files/2019/02/Notice-of-Public-Auction-FOC-2-7-2019.pdf) in the amount of $1.5 million guaranteeing removal of the vessel from Honolulu Harbor within 60 calendar days from the bill of sale. The 280 foot long, iron-hulled, four-masted ship will be available for inspection to potential bidders on February 15. Sealed bids are due by 11 AM on February 28th. The winning bidder will be announced later that day. If no bids are received the State reserves the right to sell the ship by negotiation, to scrap it or to dispose of it by any other legal means.

The ship has been owned by the non-profit group Friends of the Falls of Clyde, (FFOC) for roughly ten years. The Bishop Museum, the previous owner, planned on scrapping or sinking the ship until the group purchased her for $1 in 2008.

The State of Hawaii has provided rent-free dockage for the ship at Pier 7 in Honolulu since 2009. Attempts by the FFOC to raise funds for drydocking and refurbishment were not successful. Citing concerns over the ship’s condition, the ship was impounded by the State in 2016.

Recently, an attempt by a new group, the [International Friends of the Falls of Clyde,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/01/save-the-falls-of-clyde-international-postpones-ship-move/) to charter a heavy lift ship to carry the old windjammer back to her birthplace in Scotland, [fell through](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/01/save-the-falls-of-clyde-international-postpones-ship-move/). 

Then, last week, the [ship began to sink at the dock](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/02/historic-tall-ship-falls-of-clyde-almost-sinks-at-dock/) due to cracks and open seams in the hull plates. Divers were able to make emergency repairs and salvage pumps removed excess water. 

Apparently, the State of Hawaii has simply had enough. As reported by the [Star Advertiser](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/02/07/breaking-news/state-puts-falls-of-clyde-up-for-auction-after-decade-of-waiting/): 

“We’ve given 10 years to the process and repeatedly we’ve heard the same thing — we just need time,” said Transportation Department spokesman Tim Sakahara. “There’ve been numerous attempts at fundraising and removal, and all have been unsuccessful. Given the current state of this ship and continued deterioration, it needs to be moved now. We’re moving forward with the next step, which is the auction.”

Built by Russell & Co. in Port Glasgow, Scotland, in 1878, the Falls of Clyde is the last surviving iron-hulled, four-masted full-rigged ship, and the only remaining sail-driven oil tanker.
