![ReplaceES](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ReplaceES.jpg)We recently posted about [Scott Kelly, the American astronaut](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/03/scott-kelly-starship-sailor-returns-home-taller-after-a-year-in-space/) who spent almost a year in space on the international Space Station. Scott Kelly is an alumnus of the State University of New York Maritime College at Fort Schuyler.  Before graduating in 1987, it is very likely that he trained on the school ship *[Empire State VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TS_Empire_State_VI)*.  The school ship is now 54 years old; two years older than Scott Kelly. The school recently posted a letter asking for support for funding to build a replacement. Click on the link below to show your support.

## [Help us replace the Empire State VI](http://www.sunymaritime.edu/replace-empire-state-vi)

The men and women who make up the national maritime industry are vital to the nation’s economy and security. They are also in short supply.

The federal government predicts there is a growing need for licensed captains, mates, pilots and ship engineers – four thousand a year until 2022.

Nearly 70 percent of those licensed mariners come from the same source – one of six state maritime academies. Training ships are essential to their mission of educating and preparing the next generation of merchant mariners.

It is time to begin replacing these ships, beginning with the 54-year-old Empire State VI, to ensure the nation has the mariners it needs.

In 2016 the federal budget included funding to design National Security Multi-Mission Vessels – a new class of ships that will be used to train licensed mariners and to respond to disasters.

We are at a critical juncture and need Congress to move forward to fund the construction of the first of these ships.

We need all hands on deck.
