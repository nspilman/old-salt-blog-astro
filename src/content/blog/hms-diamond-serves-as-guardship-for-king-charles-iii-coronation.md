![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diamond.jpg)[HMS *Diamond*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Diamond_\(D34\)), a Type [45 Royal Navy air-defense destroyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_45_destroyer), docked on the River Thames in Greenwich, served as the Royal Guardship during the coronation of King Charles III earlier today. While the purpose of the guard ship is to help protect the king during his coronation, the *Diamond* is also hosting a series of VIP cocktail parties and performances by the Royal Marines band.

Naval chiefs say the destroyer will be ready for action “at the flick of a switch”. Equipped with the cutting-edge Sea Viper missile system, which includes the Sampson radar and the Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles, the ship can effectively identify, track, and neutralize a wide range of aerial threats, including enemy aircraft, drones, and missiles.
