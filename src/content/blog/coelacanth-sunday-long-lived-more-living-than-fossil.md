![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/coelacanth.jpg)[Coelacanths](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelacanth) apparently evolved in their current form around 400 million years ago. They were thought to have gone extinct 65 million years ago, during the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction – that is, until 1938 when a fisherman in South Africa pulled one up in his nets.  Not surprisingly, they are often referred to as “living fossils.”  Since their discovery off South Africa, they have also been found in the waters off the Comoros, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar. In 1999, coelacanths were also found in the waters of Indonesia off Sulawesi.

Now German scientists have found something else quite remarkable about these rare fish. After a twenty year study they have determined that coelacanths can live up to a hundred years and possibly even longer.  This would make the coelacanth not only one of the world’s oldest fish species, but possibly also the longest-lived.  Thanks to coelacanth savant and prodigious polymath, Allan Janus for pointing out the article.
