![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/07/svirginia-125x186.jpg)At the end of May, we posted about the “[unfortunate economics of tall ships](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/05/27/the-unfortunate-economics-of-tall-ships/).”   All ships, sailing ships included and perhaps, especially, are devilishly expensive to maintain and run, and income is tough to come by, especially in these difficult economic times.  One of the examples we noted was the 126-foot [schooner *Virginia*](http://www.schoonervirginia.org/) which had fallen on [hard times](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/10/17/cash-strapped-schooner-virginia-appears-dead-in-the-water/) in 2009.  We are therefore immensely pleased to see that the schooner *Virginia* is back sailing, running educational  programs to teach children about sailing, leadership and the importance of the Elizabeth River and why it should be protected.   “[Elizabeth River Adventures](http://www.elizabethriver.org/Event/EventDetail.aspx?ID=180),” is a seagoing camp run jointly by the schooner *Virginia*, [Nauticus](http://www.nauticus.org/) and the [Elizabeth River Project](http://www.elizabethriver.org/).

The nonprofit [Virginia Maritime Heritage Foundation](http://www.schoonervirginia.org/) raised money for new masts and rigging for the schooner and has formed a partnership with the museum, [Nauticus](http://www.nauticus.org/), to take over the schooner’s operation. Last month, the Virginia served as an anchored mark in the Parade of Sail that opened OpSail. Now, it’s a highlight of the summer camp. And next year, the *Virginia* will pay a role in a new sailing center for disadvantaged youths. All we can say is “welcome back!”
