*I thoroughly enjoyed this novel by Rick Spilman – actually his debut novel! Spilman knows ships and the sea. He has worked as a naval architect and is an avid sailor. He has also sailed as volunteer crew on the replica square-riggers “HMS Rose” and “HMS Bounty,” and much more. Even though he doesn’t overstate it, his vast knowledge shows. Hell Around the Horn is also very well written; the characters are interesting and very much alive; and the story is based on historical facts. Hell Around the Horn had me racing through the story. Even without naval battles and taller-than-life naval heroes, this book really is a page turner. It is highly recommended!
