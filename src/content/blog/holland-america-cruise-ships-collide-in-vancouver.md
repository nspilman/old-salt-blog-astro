![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/05/crusieshipcollision.jpg)While docking in Vancouver on Saturday morning, the Holland America cruise ship MS   
[*Oosterdam*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Oosterdam) collided with the MS *[Nieuw Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Nieuw_Amsterdam_\(2009\))* also owned by Holland America. The stern of the Oosterdam struck the stern of the already docked *Nieuw Amsterdam*. No injuries were reported and the damage was well above the waterline on both ships. Holland America says that damage to *Oosterdam* is minimal, while [six stateroom verandas on the *Nieuw Amsterdam*](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/cruise-ship-collides-with-locked-cruise-liner-in-vancouver-port) require repairs, which got underway immediately. One source referred to the collision as a “[parallel parking job gone wrong](https://www.foxnews.com/travel/holland-america-cruise-ships-collide-during-parallel-parking-job-gone-wrong).”
