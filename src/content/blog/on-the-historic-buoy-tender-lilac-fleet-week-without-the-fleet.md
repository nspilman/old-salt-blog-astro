![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/09/liliac.jpg )For the last 30 years, New York has welcomed ships and crews from the US Navy and Coast Guard to the harbor around the Memorial Day weekend during a celebration of [Fleet Week](http://www.fleetweeknewyork.com/fleetweeknewyork/).  Unfortunately, this year’s Fleet Week has been scuttled by the sequester and an obstructionist Congress. Nevertheless, the folks on the [historic buoy-tender Lilac](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/) will be celebrating [Fleet Week Without the Fleet](http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=2a197f1ae59cfefb2ce14c8be&id=a8c3f964ff&e=d22827da0e) with a series of events including readings, photography and presentations from Thursday, May 23 to Tuesday, May 28.  [Click here to see the schedule of events](http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=2a197f1ae59cfefb2ce14c8be&id=a8c3f964ff&e=d22827da0e). *Lilac* is berthed at [Hudson River Park’s Pier 25](http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/explore-the-park/locations/pier-25) at West Street and N. Moore Street.

*Lilac* is America’s only surviving steam-powered lighthouse tender. Built in 1933 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, *Lilac* is now a museum ship owned by the non-profit [Lilac Preservation Project](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/).
