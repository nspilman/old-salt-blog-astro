[*![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sailingyacht200.jpg)Sailing Yacht A*,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/10/sailing-yacht-one-biggest-definitely-ugliest/) one of the largest, most technologically advanced and, to my eyes at least, the ugliest, sailing yacht in the world, arrived in Gibraltar recently to be turned over to its owner, Andrey Melnichenko, following extensive sea trials. Not all went as planned. Within hours of its arrival, [the futuristic yacht was seized by local authorities](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39026845).

*Sailing Yacht A,* which took four years to build and is reported to have cost €400m, was arrested based on a claim of €15.3m (£13.3m; $16.3m) for unpaid bills, filed by [Nobiskrug](http://www.nobiskrug.com/superyachts/en/newsevents.html), the shipyard in Northern Germany, which built the yacht. The yacht is 143m (469ft) long and has three free-standing rotating carbon fiber masts. The main mast is 100m tall. *Sailing Yacht A* can set 40,330 sq ft of sail, which is 8,000 sq ft greater than sail area on the tea clipper [*Cutty Sark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark). The yacht also features eight decks, an underwater observation pod, and hybrid diesel-electric propulsion.  Thanks to David Rye for contributing to this post.
