![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/stamp.jpg)In 1898, the *[Chauncy Maples](http://www.chauncymaples.org/ship/default.php)* [](http://www.chauncymaples.org/ship/default.php)was built at the shipyard of Alley & McLellan in Glasgow.   She was then disassembled into 3,481 parts and shipped out for reassembly at Monkey Bay as a missionary/hospital steamer on Lake Malawi.  Now, one hundred and twelve years later, the *Chauncy Maples* may be returning to duty as a traveling clinic on the 560 kilometer long [Lake Malawi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Malawi).   The [Chauncy Maples Malawi Trust](http://www.chauncymaples.org/default.php) is now attempting to raise £2m to fund the project.   With major [sponsorship from insurance firm Thomas Miller](http://www.thomasmiller.com/about-thomas-miller/125-years-chauncy-maples/) and wider support from donors and NGOs, they appear to be well on their way.
