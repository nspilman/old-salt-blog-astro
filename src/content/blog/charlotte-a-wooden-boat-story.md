The [Gannon & Benjamin Marine Railway](http://www.gannonandbenjamin.com/), located on the island of Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, must be a pretty amazing place. In July of 2010, we reviewed [Schooner – Building a Wooden Boat on Martha’s Vineyard](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615342671?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0615342671), which was about building a schooner at the Gannon & Benjamin yard. Now we have learned of a documentary about another wooden boat built at Gannon & Benjamin.
