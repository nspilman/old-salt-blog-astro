*The young sailor claims that music helped her get through the months she was alone onboard Ella’s Pink Lady. It was also a source of comfort during the more challenging times.*  
  
*“Singing along to my favourite songs even kept me sane at times,” she said as today’s album announcement came through.*

*“I am so excited to be able to share my journey with all the people that have supported me along the way.”*

*The compilation album is set for release in August coinciding with the release of Ms Watson’s book* *[True Spirit.]("http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0733624979?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0733624979)*
