![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/02/weaponscache-1.jpg)About a year ago [we posted about an active-duty US Coast Guard lieutenant](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/02/coast-guard-officer-accused-of-plotting-domestic-terrorism/) accused of plotting attacks “to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.” Christopher Paul Hasson, 50, a self-avowed white nationalist, was arrested after federal investigators uncovered a cache of weapons, ammunition, and illegal drugs in his Maryland home. The court documents, also charged that Hasson was “a domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect governmental conduct.”

Hasson called for “focused violence” to “establish a white homeland” and dreamed of ways to “kill almost every last person on earth.” He compiled a spreadsheet hit list of prominent Democratic politicians including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Hasson was [indicted last year and pleaded guilty](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/coast-guard-lt-christopher-hasson-set-to-be-sentenced-in-alleged-terror-plot/2020/01/31/d01b048a-43ce-11ea-aa6a-083d01b3ed18_story.html) to firearms and drug charges. He was sentenced Friday to 13 years in federal prison.
