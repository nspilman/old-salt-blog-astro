![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lord_2047777b.jpg)The American movie, [Top Gun](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002WZTOI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B0002WZTOI), starring Tom Cruise, won 8 Academy Awards and earned over $300 million at the box office. The movie was inaccurate in several ways, not the least of which was the addition of a sexy female flight instructor to provide a love interest for the male pilots. It also left out any mention of the British instructors from Fleet Air Arm who were instrumental in establishing the US Navy Fighter Weapons School, better known as Top Gun. Brigadier General Richard Stanley Lord, who died in late October at the age of 75, was the foremost British instructor sent to train American pilots in 1968, who at the height of the Vietnam War were being shot down at an unacceptable rate by by North Vietnamese pilots.

[Brigadier General Dick Lord](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/naval-obituaries/8873213/Brigadier-General-Dick-Lord.html)  
  
*He and a handful of other Fleet Air Arm graduates of the Royal Navy’s gruelling Air Warfare Instructors (AWI) school in Lossiemouth, Scotland, introduced rigorous new methods for recording and scrutinising the performance of trainees during exercises. Lord, for example, scribbled notes on a pad on the knee of his flight suit during mock dogfights, which he then exhaustively analysed on a blackboard at post-flight debriefs.*

*Such was the trust placed in Lord that he was granted access to classified American military documents comparing the performance of US aircraft against that of enemy fighters. This access allowed him to write, with others, the US Navy’s Air Combat Manoeuvring manual.*

*A year after Lord’s arrival, the tuition and methods introduced by British pilots, all graduates of the AWI school at Lossiemouth, made their way into the US Navy Fighter Weapons School, which was set up in 1969. Better known as Top Gun, it remains the most famous programme in the history of naval aviation. Soon after it was established a Phantom flown by one of its first students shot down a MiG-21, the first time a US Navy aircraft had succeeded in aerial combat in two years.*

*Lord enjoyed the film Top Gun, but mused that it was “remarkable that any history book studiously avoids mention of any British involvement” and added that the film had not “given us due justice”. He remained proud of his involvement, however, and during his time at Miramar had insisted on using the call sign “Brit 1”. This meant that his wingman, though American, was forced to use the call sign “Brit 2”.*

*Dick Lord married, in 1968, June Beckett, a BOAC air-hostess. While he complained about the fantastical characterisations in Top Gun, she contended that the film’s portrayal of big-talking fighter pilots was extremely true-to-life. She survives him with their two sons.*

*Brig Gen Dick Lord, born June 20 1936, died October 26 2011.*
