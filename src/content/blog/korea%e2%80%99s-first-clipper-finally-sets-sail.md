The yacht was in Korea for modifications, when the Mafiosa was arrested and sent to prison.  The boat was purchased by a Korean who named her *Koreana* and intends to use her to teach students about the sea.

The *Koreana* is said to be the first “clipper” in Korea. Fortunately the articles defines what it means by “clipper”:

*What differentiates a clipper from a yacht is the length of the vessel and the number of masts it has. Ships with a length of over 60 feet (about 18.3 meters) and more than two masts are considered clippers. Because clippers are expensive to maintain and a large crew is needed to raise and drop the anchor, they are generally considered to be a ship for the wealthy.*
