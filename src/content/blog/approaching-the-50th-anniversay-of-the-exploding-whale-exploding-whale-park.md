![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/explodingwhale.jpg)Fifty years ago this November,  the residents of Florence, Oregon [learned how not to dispose of a dead whale](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/how-not-to-dispose-of-a-dead-whale/). Now, a half-century later they have named a park after that lesson. The residents have recently chosen to name a local recreational area “Exploding Whale Memorial Park.”

On November 9, 1970, a [45-foot  long, 8-ton whale, described variously as a gray or sperm whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploding_whale#Oregon), washed ashore at Florence on the central Oregon Coast.  At the time, Oregon beaches were under the jurisdiction of the state’s Highway Division, which, after consulting with the United States Navy, decided to remove the whale using dynamite – assuming that the resulting pieces would be small enough for scavenger animals to consume.

It turned out to be a really, really bad idea. The explosion instead spewed large chunks of decayed whale on curious bystanders and even crushed a nearby parked car.  The moment was caught on video and has since been memorialized on YouTube (see below.) 

The [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/us/exploding-whale-memorial-park.html) reports that after the park opened last May with a temporary name. The city asked residents for suggestions for a permanent title, later narrowing those to a few in an online survey.

More than half of the final tally — 439 out of 856 responses — voted for “Exploding Whale Memorial Park.”
