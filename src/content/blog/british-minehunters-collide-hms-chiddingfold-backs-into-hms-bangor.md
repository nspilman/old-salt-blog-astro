![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/01/mineunterallision.jpg)UK Royal Navy minehunter [HMS *Chiddingfold*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Chiddingfold_\(M37\)) collided with [HMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Bangor_\(M109\)) *Bangor* while maneuvering in Bahrain harbor on January 18th. No one was reported to be injured but *Bangor* was seriously damaged, with a large hole ripped in its fiberglass hull.

Both ships are specialist minesweeper vessels, part of the UK’s long-standing presence in the Gulf.

“We are aware of an incident concerning two minehunters alongside in Bahrain. There are no casualties as a result of this incident and it would be inappropriate to comment further whilst investigations are ongoing,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence told the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68040614).

This is the [second time that HMS *Chiddingfold* has been involved in such an incident](https://www.forces.net/news/navy-ships-collision-gulf-causes-ps100000-damage). In 2021, also off the coast of Bahrain, it struck [HMS *Penzance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Penzance_\(M106\)), a ship of the same class as HMS *Bangor*.

HMS *Bangor* is due to be decommissioned next year. HMS *Bangor* is a Sandown-class minehunter commissioned by the Royal Navy in 1999.

HMS *Chiddingfold* is a Hunt-class mine countermeasures vessel commissioned in 1984.
