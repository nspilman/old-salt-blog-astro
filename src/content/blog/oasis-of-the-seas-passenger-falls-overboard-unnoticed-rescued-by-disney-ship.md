![Oasis_of_the_Seas2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Oasis_of_the_Seas2.jpg)Frank Jade was a passenger on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship *Oasis of the Seas* until Thursday morning when [he said that a large wave knocked him off an open deck and into the sea](http://www.inquisitr.com/1741375/royal-caribbean-passenger-falls-overboard-unnoticed-man-saved-by-passing-disney-cruise-line-ship/#.VLDWph6SH3E.email), approximately eight miles from Cozumel, Mexico. Reportedly, no one saw him go overboard and no alarm was raised.

As if by magic, however, Jade was spotted by someone on a passing cruise ship, specifically the *[Disney Magic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Magic),* which was on the same course as the  Royal Caribbean ship.  The *Magic* lowered a boat and picked up Jade.  The ship docked at docked at Punta Langsota so Jade could be transferred to a private clinic for medical care.  Frank Jade is said to be in stable condition without any serious injuries. Reportedly, no one on the *Oasis of the Seas* even realized that Jade was missing. *Oasis of the Seas,* with her near sister ship*, Allure of the Seas,* are the world’s largest crusie ships with a passenger capacity exceeding 6,000 and a crew of 2,400.

And, wonder of wonders, this is not the first time that a Disney ship has come to the rescue.  [In 2009, the *Disney Wonder* picked up a passenger](http://news.legalexaminer.com/man-overboard-carnival-cruise-liner-rescued-by-disney.aspx?googleid=270286) who had apparently jumped from the *Carnival Sensation* in the Atlantic off the coast of south Florida.

Critics are complaining that Royal Caribbean has not installed automatic man overboard systems, as required by the [2010 Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act (CVSSA.)](http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/660097.txt)  The problem is that the US Coast Guard has not, so far, developed and issued the regulations as to what systems are required under the law. It is one thing to require an automated man overboard system and quite another to make one work.

Thanks to Irwin Bryan for passing along the news.
