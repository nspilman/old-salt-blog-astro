The first time I saw [Billy Black](http://www.billyblack.com/)‘s photo of the collision, I had to look twice to believe what I was seeing. It show two white yachts, both under full sail, one slicing half-way through the other.  The collision took place on 07/07/07.  The losing boat in the collision was the 107-year-old NY30 Herreshoff yacht *Amorita* of Newport, RI.   “[*07-07-07, Amorita’s Unlucky Day”*](http://www.ny30.org/amorita_film.htm) is a film, directed by French sailor-director Pierre Marcel, which recounts the history, dramatic sinking and resurrection of the classic yacht Amorita.
