The [Space Shuttle Enterprise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Enterprise) has not had an easy time in New York.  When it was barged last Sunday between Kennedy Airport and Bayonne, New Jersey, prior to its final move to the [Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum](http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/), it suffered minor [damage to one wingtip](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/06/space-shuttle-enterprise-damaged-en-route-to-new-home/) when the barge brushed alongside a New York railroad bridge.  We understand that NASA is not pleased.  The final move to the museum was scheduled for today, but was delayed to Wednesday by inclement weather.   Currently, we understand that the shuttle on the barge will be off the Statue of Liberty around 9:50 AM Wednesday morning for a photo shoot. Estimated arrival time at the Intrepid at Pier 86 is 11:15 AM, with offloading expected later during the day.  Thanks to Tony Seideman fro contributing to the post.
