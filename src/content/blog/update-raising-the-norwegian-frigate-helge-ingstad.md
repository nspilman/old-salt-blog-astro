![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/norwegFrigate1.jpg)The Norwegian frigate *Helge Ingstad*, which [collided with the tanker](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/11/tanker-collides-with-norwegian-frigate-frigate-loses/) *Sola TS*  near Bergen, has now largely been raised from where it sank last November.  The ship has been moored to the two crane lifts *Gulliver* and *Rambiz* which were used to raise the ship. As much water as possible is being pumped from the frigate in preparation for lifting the ship onto a deck barge for transport to a shipyard.

[TU Maritime](https://www.tu.no/artikler/folg-hevingen-av-fregatten-helge-ingstad/457300) reports: When the keel on *Helge Ingstad* is raised to 4.8 meters below the waterline, the barge *Boabarge 33* can be positioned under the frigate. The barge will then be deballasted and lift the frigate over the last few meters over water.

If everything goes according to plan, the vessel will be transported to the Haakonsvern for preservation, preservation, and de-marching after the raising. Finally, an assessment of the damage must be made and whether the vessel is to be phased out or repaired.
