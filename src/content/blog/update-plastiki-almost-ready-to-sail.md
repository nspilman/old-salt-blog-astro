![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/plastiki.jpg)Last March we posted [Plastiki – Boat made of plastic bottles to make ocean voyage](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-plastiki21-2010feb21,0,728915.story) about  a project in which David de Rothschild intended to build and sail a catamaran made of  around 12,000 recycled soda bottles across the Pacific.   Almost a year later Plastiki is getting ready to sail.

*David de Rothschild is talking trash, lots and lots of trash.*

*“There were 25 billion Styrofoam cups used last year. How do you even get your head around what 25 billion Styrofoam cups looks like?” he said. “Eighty-odd percent of what’s purchased by Americans is thrown out within six months.”*  
  
*On this day, though, the British banking heir is focused on some very particular refuse as he skims along the San Francisco Bay in a catamaran called Plastiki: The 12,000 or so recycled soda bottles lashed together to build his clunky vessel, and the growing heap of plastic fragments called the Eastern Garbage Patch floating in the Pacific.*

*If all goes well — so far, it’s been a little hit and miss — De Rothschild hopes to set sail aboard Plastiki in March, tour the garbage patch and end up in Australia, while blogging about the evils of plastic and a consumer society.*
