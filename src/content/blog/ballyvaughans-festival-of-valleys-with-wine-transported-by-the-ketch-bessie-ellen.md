In response to our post, [Tall Ships Hit By Slumping Economy](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/02/tall-ships-hit-by-slumping-economy/),  Will from the [Tugster](http://tugster.wordpress.com/) blog and Captain Peter from [Nautical Log](http://nauticallog.blogspot.com/) commented about the potential synergies of tall ships carrying cargo in addition to passengers.   Well great minds, and all that.  An example of what both these gentlemen were referring to took place last weekend in Ballyvaughan, Ireland in County Claire, at the [Festival of the Valleys](http://www.limerickpost.ie/index.php?id=1834:ballyvaughan-to-welcome-historic-tall-ship-full-of-wine-&option=com_content&catid=24:food&Itemid=54), which “*celebrate\[s\] the very best of traditional Irish and Mediterranean culture and cuisine. This unique event … merge\[s\] the unique environment of the Burren with glorious splendour of the Mediterranean*.”    Fittingly enough, the wine for the festival was delivered by the Ketch [Bessie Ellen](http://www.schoonerman.com/redsky/bessie_ellen_ketch.htm),  one of the last remaining examples of a West Country Trading Ketch, from the festival director’s own vineyard in the Languedoc-Rousillon area of southern France.
