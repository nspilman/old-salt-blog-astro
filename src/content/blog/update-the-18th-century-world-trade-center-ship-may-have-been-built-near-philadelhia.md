![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/07/CityRoom-ShipA.jpg)Four years ago, workers excavating at the new World Trade Center site in lower Manhattan uncovered [the remains of an 18th century wooden merchant ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/18th-century-ship-found-buried-at-new-yorks-world-trade-center-site/). The ship was found 20 feet below street level,  is roughly 30 feet in length and was probably buried intentionally as land fill.  It was found in an area outside that which had been previously excavated for the original World Trade Center complex and appears to have remained undisturbed since it was buried in the late 1700s.

Now a new report has been published in the Tree Ring Society journal [Tree Ring Research](http://www.treeringsociety.org/TRBTRR/TRBTRR.htm#Vol70) which dates the ship and gives an indication where it was built. Much of the [“news” in the report dates back to 2011](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/07/update-investigating-the-world-trade-center-ship-using-rings-and-worms/), when [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rings-worms-tale-ground-zero-shipwreck/) reported that Dr. [Neil Pederson](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~adk/) and a team from the Columbia University’s [Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/) had determined that “*the ship was likely built in 1773 in a small shipyard on the outskirts of a major metropolitan center.*” The new report, of which Dr. Pederson is one of the authors, now identifies the “major metropolitan center” as probably Philadelphia. Additionally, the ship appears to have been built from the same kind of white oak trees used to build parts of Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution were signed.
