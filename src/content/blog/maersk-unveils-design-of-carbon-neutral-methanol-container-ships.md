Earlier this year we posted [Maersk Bets on Methanol — Orders One Feeder and Eight Large Dual Fuel Containerships.](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/10/maersk-bets-on-methanol-orders-one-feeder-and-eight-large-dual-fuel-containerships/) The feeder vessel is expected to be delivered in 2023, with the first of the eight 16,000 TEU ships, built by Hyundai, rolling out starting in 2024. This week Maersk [revealed the new carbon-neutral large ship design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Th5M-fx3Yk).

In designing the large 16,000 TEU ships, Maersk started with a clean slate. In addition to engineering the dual-fuel engines capable of safely burning green methanol, they developed a forward accommodation design, with the stack all the way aft, which Maersk claims will increase energy efficiency by 20% per container compared to industry average. The eight ship series will cost $1.4 billion and will replace older vessels, generating annual CO2 emissions savings of around 1 million tonnes.
