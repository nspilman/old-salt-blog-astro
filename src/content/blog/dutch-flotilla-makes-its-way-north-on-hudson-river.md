[Dutch flotilla makes its way north on Hudson River](http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/dutch-flotilla-makes-its-way-north-on-hudson-river-1.1455340)

*A flotilla of historic Dutch sailing ships is making its way up the Hudson River to mark this month’s 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson’s voyage aboard the Half Moon.*  
  
*A replica of the Half Moon is sailing north along with another upstate-based replica Dutch ship — the Onrust (AHN’-roost) — and a fleet of flat-bottom boats that arrived in New York aboard a Dutch freighter.*

*The Dutch boats and replica ships took part in events held earlier this month in New York Harbor to welcome the crown prince of the Netherlands and his wife to New York.*

*The Dutch flotilla will sail along the Dutchess County shoreline Thursday morning while in route to Albany, where Hudson 400th anniversary events are being held the weekend of Sept. 26-27.*

For great photos and discussion of the Dutch sailing barges see the [Tugster blog](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/ny400-week-armada/) .   [Bowsprite also has a great photo](http://bowsprite.wordpress.com/2009/09/15/happy-harbor-week/) of the flotilla heading up river taken from her lofty aerie.
