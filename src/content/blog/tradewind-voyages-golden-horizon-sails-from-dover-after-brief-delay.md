[Tradewind Voyages](https://www.tradewindvoyages.com/) [*Golden Horizon*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/06/update-golden-horizon-ex-flying-clipper-worlds-largest-sailing-ship-to-sail-from-uk-next-year/) has recently embarked on her maiden voyage, after a brief delay. As she set sail on a four-day voyage from Dover, UK, the [ship was forced to turn around](https://travelweekly.co.uk/news/cruise/golden-horizon-finally-departs-dover-after-arrest) due to a financial dispute between the original owner, [Star Clippers](https://www.starclippers.com/us-dom/), and the [Brodosplit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodosplit) shipyard in Croatia at which she was built. After a delay of almost 24 hours, the ship was allowed to sail.

The 272 passenger five-masted barque, setting 68,000 square feet of sail, or over twice the sail area of the clipper ship *Cutty Sark*, is the largest square-rigged sailing ship in the world.

Below is lovely drone footage of the *Golden Horizon* leaving Fowey, Cornwall on July 10, 2021.
