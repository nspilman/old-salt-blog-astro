![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/orghostship.jpg)The so-called [Ohio River ghost ship](https://maps.roadtrippers.com/us/petersburg-ky/points-of-interest/abandoned-ghost-ship) does not seem to be really haunted, except perhaps by a long and illustrious past. A vessel of many names, she has been known as *Celt*, *Sachem*, USS *Phenakite*, *Sightseer*, and *Circle Line V.* Built in 1902 as a rich man’s yacht, she served as a Navy anti-submarine patrol craft in both world wars, as a laboratory for Thomas Edison, as a luxury fishing boat, and New York City tour boat. She is said to have been visited by two presidents, appeared in several movies and served as a set for a Madonna music video. She is estimated to have carried around 3 million passengers in her long working life.

Rumor had it that she was scrapped in 1984, but she turned up again in a creek off the Ohio River, in Petersburg, Kentucky, about 25 miles downstream from Cincinnati. She has apparently been abandoned there since around 1987. Dubbed the “ghost ship,” she is a popular destination for kayakers.

She began her life in 1902 as the 186-foot-long yacht *Celt* by [Pusey and Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusey_and_Jones "Pusey and Jones"), Wilmington, Delaware, for [J. Rogers Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Rogers_Maxwell "J. Rogers Maxwell"), a railroad executive. A change of owners resulted in a name change and she became *Sachem*. Not long after the US entered World War I, she was acquired by the US Navy as a Coastal Patrol Craft becoming USS *Sachem*.  For a period of time, she was turned over to Thomas Edison for use as a floating laboratory to develop anti-submarine warfare technology. 

Between the world wars, the vessel went through several owners and ended up as a fishing boat. In 1945, the Navy acquired her again for use in the anti-submarine patrol. Renamed [USS *Phenakite*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Phenakite), she patrolled the Florida Keys and was later used as a platform for testing sonar systems. 

After the war, the ship was purchased by the [Circle Line of New York City](https://www.circleline.com/sightseeing-cruises?matchtype=e&keyword=circle%20line%20new%20york%20city&cid=1955760677&agid=70954391695&device=c&placement=&creative=385147818713&target=&adposition=1t1&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=gp-branded-local-search&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjOrtBRCcARIsAEq4rW42AkaCczWP7Vg4VGHYCzEeQsxQSFyDLMNvEzKInVKC4dUfwU0XRzYaAvygEALw_wcB) and renamed first *Sightseer* and then *Circle Line V*. She served as an around Manahattan tour boat until 1983. After that the story gets fuzzy. She was said to be sold to a Cinncinati local named Robert Miller for $7,500. And somehow she ended up abandoned in a creek off the Ohio River.
