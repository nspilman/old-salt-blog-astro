![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Clion.jpg)Yemeni Houthi rebels have released a video of an attack they claim to have been carried out by a sea drone on an oil tanker in the Red Sea. The footage shows a small vessel approaching, then colliding with the ship’s port side, resulting in a large explosion. 

[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cm528nmymn8o) has confirmed that the tanker seen in the video is the [*Chios Lion*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/9398280). The attack occurred on July 15, 100 nautical miles northwest of Yemen’s port of Hodeidah. The attack is reported to have inflicted minor damage to the *Chios Lion.* The tanker’s crew was not injured in the attack.

Satellite images revealed that an oil slick between 40-200 km may have resulted from the attack.

While the Houthis initially said they were only attacking ships connected with Israel, the *Chios Lion* was loaded with 100,000 tonnes of Russian oil believed to be bound for China.

The Iranian-backed Houthis scored their first hit with a sea drone in June, striking the [M/V *Tutor*,](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:7183172/mmsi:636021179/imo:9942627/vessel:TUTOR) a Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier.
