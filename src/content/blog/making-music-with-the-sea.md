This is not specifically a Mother’s Day post, but somehow, it feels right to post today. Women of the [Banks Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks_Islands), a group of islands in northern Vanuatu, in the Pacific stand waist deep in the ocean and literally play the water by pounding out complex rhythmic patterns to show their appreciation to the sea. The short clip below is from a BBC Documentary [‘South Pacific’ ( ‘Wild Pacific’ in the US)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BEXDXY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B002BEXDXY) and as reported by Adelle Havard in Mother Jones – [Power of Communication](http://motherjones.com/blue-marble/2011/05/power-communication).   Thanks to [Steamboat Bill](http://www.sshsa.org/) for tweeting about this music of the waters.
