Washington & Hamilton at Federal Hall

Today, on the 225th anniversary of George Washington signing of the legislation establishing the [Revenue-Marine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Revenue_Cutter_Service), the predecessor to the United States Coast Guard, President George Washington and his Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, returned to [Federal Hall](http://www.nps.gov/feha/index.htm) in New York City, where the act was signed on August 4, 1790. OK, they were not literally Washington and Hamilton. (Alexander Hamilton is buried just a few blocks to the west at Trinity Church in lower Manhattan.) Washington was portrayed by [John Lopes](http://ahtheatre.org/america/home/george-washington-lopes) and Hamilton by [Ian Rose](http://www.meetalexanderhamilton.com/Alexander_Hamilton/Home.html).

The reenactment was part of a commemoration of the United States Coast Guard’s birthday and was organized jointly by the Coast Guard, the [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov/feha/upload/FEHA-USCG-Flyer-Finally-version.pdf) and the [Alexander Hamilton Awareness Society](http://www.the-aha-society.com/).  (Until today, I was not aware of the Alexander Hamilton Awareness Society.)

Washington and Hamilton discussed conditions in the republic of 1790 and the formation of the Revenue Marine. Hamilton also read his “[Letter of Instructions to the Commanding Officers of the Revenue Cutters](https://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/hamiltonletter.pdf).”

In addition to the reenactors, Commissioner of Veteran’s Affairs Loree Sutton presented Captain Michael Day with a Mayoral Proclamation denoting Aug. 4 as Coast Guard Day in New York City. Captain Day became the [Captain of the Port of New York and New Jersey](http://www.uscgnews.com/go/doc/4007/2561670/Coast-Guard-Sector-New-York-held-change-of-command-ceremony) this July.  Captain Day also spoke and commented that Hamilton’s “Instructions to the Commanding Officers of the Revenue Cutters” still provides guidance to Coast Guard officers to this day.
