![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/01/dasbanner.jpg)I am very excited by a new series, “[Disasters at Sea](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/disasters-at-sea/1005669)” that will be premiering on the Smithsonian Channel this Sunday, January 13th. The series is produced by Exploration Production Inc. in association with Smithsonian Networks and Discovery Channel (Canada). The series will be airing in Canada in early February. 

The premiere episode, “[*Trapped in Typhoon Alley*](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/disasters-at-sea/trapped-in-typhoon-alley/1005669/3467453) “, looks at the mysterious sinking of MV *Derbyshire,* which disappeared in Typhoon Orchid off Japan with a load of 160,000 tonnes of iron ore in 1980. She remains the largest British ship ever to have been lost at sea.

Subsequent episodes include “[*Deadly Neglect*](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/videos/a-cargo-ship-lost-in-the-atlantic-prompts-a-flurry-of-questions/65341) “, the loss of the SS *Marine Electric;* “[*Four Minutes to Survive*](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/videos/a-team-of-specialists-roll-over-a-capsized-ship/65382) “, the capsize of the MV *Rockness* off the coast of Norway; “[*The Ice Ship*](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/videos/the-terrifying-fate-awaiting-mv-explorer/65462) “, the sinking of the MV *Explorer* in Antarctica; “*Shipwrecked in Alaska* “, the rescue of the crew of the *Alaska Ranger**;* and “*Torn Apart,* ” the breaking apart of the MSC *Napoli.*

The second season of *Disasters at Sea* is currently under production*.* For the sake of full disclosure, I advised on several of the episodes in both seasons.
