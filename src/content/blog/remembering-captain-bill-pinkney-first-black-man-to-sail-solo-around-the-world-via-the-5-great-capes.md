Captain Pinkney was the first Black man to sail solo around the world via the 5 Great Capes.

Captain Pinkney was in Atlanta, GA serving as an advisor for an upcoming documentary. He [passed away on Thursday morning](https://abc7chicago.com/william-pinkney-captain-bill-death-chicago-news/13723921/#:~:text=Pinkney%20passed%20away%20on%20Thursday,a%20project%20for%20National%20Geographic.) from injuries he suffered after falling down a flight of stairs a few days ago.

Captain Pinkney’s voyage featured the rounding of the five great capes including Cape Horn. The 27,000-mile circumnavigation took 22 months and ended on June 9, 1992. Throughout the trip, Pinkney sent footage back to Globe TV and communicated with some 30,000 school children. The finished production titled, “[The Incredible Voyage of Bill Pinkney](https://youtu.be/HreyEIoEXCw),” won the George Foster Peabody Award for excellence in children’s television programming. The film has aired on the Disney Channel, National Geographic, and PBS stations and is now available on YouTube.

Bill Pinkney also served as captain of the [Amistad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Amistad#Replica), the replica of the schooner known for a revolt of African captives in 1839. In January 1999, Pinkney and his crew on the *Amistad* set out to [retrace the Middle Passage slave trade routes](https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/capt-william-bill-pinkney-39). Pinkney teamed up with PBS and several corporations to create a television special, and to bring teachers from across the country on board en route so that they could experience the trip firsthand.

In 2021, Captain Pinkney was inducted into the [National Sailing Hall of Fame](https://nshof.org/inductees/pinkney-william/) with a Lifetime Achievement Award as an “Enthusiastic Trend Setter.” 

Mystic Seaport Museum presented its 2022 *[America and the Sea Award](https://mysticseaport.org/about/america-and-the-sea-award/)* to Captain  Pinkney.

His children’s book, [Sailing Commitment Around the World with Captain Bill Pinkney](https://aalbc.com/books/bookinfo.php?isbn13=9781513693361) was published in 2022. The book aims to inspire readers from 8 to 12-years-old with stories, adventures, and sights of the voyage and the lessons Captain Bill learned at sea: dream big, persevere, and don’t be distracted by hurdles that come with moving forward.

Captain Pinkney also wrote an autobiography, [As Long As it Takes: Meeting the Challenge](https://www.amazon.com/As-Long-Takes-Meeting-Challenge/dp/1593730462) in 2006.
