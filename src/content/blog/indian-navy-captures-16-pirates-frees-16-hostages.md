Indian Coast Guard ship Sangram

On Sunday the MV *Maersk Kensington* reported an attempted boarding by pirates while underway off the southern coast of India.  The Indian navy ship *[Suvarna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Suvarna_\(P52\))* and Coast Guard ship *[Sangram](http://www.hinduonnet.com/2007/05/07/stories/2007050701842000.htm)* responded, intercepting the Iranian fishing trawler *Morteza* which had been hijacked and was being used as a pirate mother ship.  After a three hour running battle, the Indian forces captured 16 pirates and freed 16 hostages, 12 Iranians and 4 Pakistanis.  
  
Since November the Indian Navy and Coast Guard has been engaged in “Operation Island Watch” near the Lakshadweep islands off India’s southwest coast.  [Earlier this month  the Indian Navy’s fast patrol craft *Kalpeni* captured 61 pirates](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/14/ins-kalpeni-nabs-61-pirates-on-mother-ship-frees-13-hostages/) and freed 13 hostages from a hijacked mother ship in the same area. Overall some 120 pirates have been apprehended under “Operation Island Watch.”
