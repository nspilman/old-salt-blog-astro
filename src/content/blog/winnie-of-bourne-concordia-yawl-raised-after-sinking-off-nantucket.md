On Friday morning, near the entrance to Nantucket harbor at around 10:30 AM, someone made a very bad mistake.  The 40′ Concordia yawl, [*Winnie of Bourne*](http://www.concordiaboats.com/yawl.php?id=11), and the 46′ Swan, *Dragon*, collided, sending the Concordia yawl to the bottom. The four aboard the 1952 built yawl were rescued from the water by the Coast Guard.  The collision remains under investigation. *Winnie of Bourne* was raised by a crane barge on Sunday.  For photographs of the yawl before the collision, [click here](http://www.yachtworld.com/boats/1952/Concordia-39'-Yawl-2625336/MA/United-States#.U-jPXfldXg0).

The collision took place just before the start of the nine day [Nantucket Race Week](http://www.nantucketraceweek.org/page/nrw), one of the busiest weeks of boat traffic on the island.
