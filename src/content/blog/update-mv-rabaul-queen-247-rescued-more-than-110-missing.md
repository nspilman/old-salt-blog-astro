As of Thursday evening, 246 survivors had been pulled from the sea, following the sinking of the passenger ferry *[MV Rabaul Queen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Rabaul_Queen)* off the coast of Papua New Guinea early Thursday.  Only one survivor was reported to be found on Friday.  According to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, survivors were rescued by merchant ships battling 16-foot (5-meter) swells and 45 mph (75 kph) winds at the disaster scene. It is feared that many of the missing may have been trapped inside the ferry when it capsized. The ferry has now sunk in water over 3,000 feet deep.
