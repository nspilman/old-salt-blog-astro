![cookbuzz](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/cookbuzz.jpg)The Russians do not appear to like the US Navy operating ships in the Baltic Sea.  [On Aprill 11, two unarmed Russian SU24 fighter jets](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/uss-donald-cook-buzzed-again-by-russian-jets-in-baltic/) made low attitude passes at the US Navy destroyer [USS *Donald Cook*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Donald_Cook).  Then, on April 12, two Russian KA27 Helix helicopters flew several circles around the *Donald Cook*, apparently taking photos. Later, two unarmed SU24 jets made approximately a dozen very close, low-level passes of the ship in what the official described as “Simulated Attack Profile.”  When the incidents took place the *Donald Cook* was roughly 70 nautical miles from the Russain port of Kaliningrad in international waters in the Baltic Sea, having sailed from Gdynia, Poland.

The US Navy posted [videos of the Russian planes buzzing the *Cook* on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkCZwiENh8).

The buzzing of the *Donald Cook* by Russian aircraft coincided with the landing of a Polish helicopter on board as part of routine training. Some have speculated that the Russians were also “sending a message to Poland.”

This is not the first time that the *Donald Cook* has been buzzed by Russian ships while in the Baltic. Almost exactly two years ago, [the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer was buzzed by two Russian SU-24 fighter jets](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-jet-makes-provocative-and-unprofessional-pass-at-uss-donald-cook/) while operating in the Baltic Sea.
