[![MOL_COMFORT](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/MOL_COMFORT.jpg)Mitsui O.S.K. Line has announced](http://www.mol.co.jp/en/pr/2013/13040.html) that “one patrol boat and three tugboats are heading to the site, and all of them are expected to arrive within June 24.”  The fore and aft sections of the ship’s hull are drifting near 15”12N 66’53”E and 13’38”N 64’10”E respectively in an east-northeast direction.

Meanwhile the [right-wing blogosphere has been going crazy](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/3034716/posts) (crazier?) having picked up [a post from a Russian blog](http://oko-planet.su/phenomen/phenomennews/194772-v-indiyskom-okeane-zatonul-ogromnyy-korabl-s-oruzhiem-dlya-siriyskih-myatezhnikov.html)  claiming that the *MOL Comfort* was carrying “*4,500 containers of arms and ammunition for the Syrian rebels.*”   The report allegedly originated with the Syrian newspaper *[Sham Life](http://www.shamlife.com/?).*  There is, of course, zero evidence to support the claim but then there rarely is in these sorts of conspiracy theories.
