Kingposts of the SS Richard Montgomery in the Thames Estuary.

The good news is that last month there was a [debate in the UK’s House of Lords](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2019-07-03a.1499.0) about what to do with the wreck of the Liberty ship [SS *Richard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Richard_Montgomery) *[Montgomery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Richard_Montgomery),* which sank loaded with munitions in the Thames estuary near Sheerness in World War II. The bad news is that similar debates have been taking place for most of the past 75 years since the ship sank with no clear answer as to what to do with the dangerous wreck.

SS *Richard Montgomery* sank in a gale in 1944. The wreck which still contains an estimated 1,400 tonnes of high explosives, has been referred to by the BBC as the “[ticking time bomb of the Thames](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151027-the-ticking-time-bomb-of-the-thames).”  The New Scientist has referred to the ship as “[The Doomsday Wreck](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18324615-100-the-doomsday-wreck/).”

For most of the intervening period since the ship sank, the strategy has been to monitor the condition of the wreck and its dangerous cargo, rather than attempt to raise the high explosives in the 9,000 shells and bombs still believed to be in the ship’s holds.  The one encouraging note is that the UK government may now be considering new means to keep the wreck safe.

[Kent Online](https://www.kentonline.co.uk/sheerness/news/new-plans-to-make-kent-bomb-ship-safe-207928/) reports that Baroness (Diana) Barran said: “An advisory group of experts is considering whether monitoring and regular surveying is still the correct course or whether a more proactive intervention should be considered.  Interventions could include the removal of munitions or some form of containment of the wreck. We appreciate there are no risk-free options which is why we are using the most qualified experts we can find.”

The risks of removing the munitions are very real, as is the risk of doing nothing. A 1967 attempt to clear the Kielce – a smaller wrecked munitions vessel almost four miles (6.4km) out to sea – [triggered an explosion](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151027-the-ticking-time-bomb-of-the-thames) that measured 4.5 on the Richter scale and damaged property in nearby Folkestone, though no injuries were reported.

On the other hand, the [Royal Military College of Science warned in 1970](https://www.kentonline.co.uk/sheerness/news/new-plans-to-make-kent-bomb-ship-safe-207928/) that if the remaining bombs blew up, the force of the explosion would create a 3,000 meter-high column of water and a five meter-high tidal wave would swamp Sheerness and its 11,000 residents and travel up the Thames.
