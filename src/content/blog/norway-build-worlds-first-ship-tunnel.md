Norway’s [Stad Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stad_\(peninsula\)) divides the Norwegian Sea to the north and the North Sea to the south. The seas, winds, currents and weather are extremely dangerous for any ship attempting to round the peninsula. Now, Norway intends to bore through the rocky shores to cut a passageway to create a short-cut for ocean going ships. The [tunnel will be the first tunnel intended for ocean-going ships](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/move-over-suez-hello-stad-norway-to-build-worlds-first-tunnel-for-ships). The tunnel will be 1,700 meters long by 37 meters high and 26.5 meters wide and is expected to cost at least 2.7bn kroner ($380m). A tunnel through the Stadt peninsula was first proposed in 1870.
