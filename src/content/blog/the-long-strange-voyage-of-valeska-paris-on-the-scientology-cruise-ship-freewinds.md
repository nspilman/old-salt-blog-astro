Valeska Paris recently appeared on the [Australian television program “Lateline”](http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/11/valeska_paris_scientology_freewinds.php)  where she charged that she was held for twelve years against her will on the cruise ship [MV *Freewinds*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freewinds), a ship operated by the Church of Scientology. The ship, the ex- MS *Bohème* for Wallenius Lines, is used as a training and recreational center by the church.  The church denies all charges.  [Scientology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology) is a religion created by L. Ron Hubbard, a science fiction writer, in the early 1950s.

The Village Voice recently interviewed Valeska Paris: [Scientology’s Cruise Ship as Prison: The Voice Interviews Valeska Paris](http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/11/valeska_paris_chris_guider_scientology_freewinds.php)

*Valeska Paris was born in Geneva, Switzerland in 1977. She had two younger siblings — Melissa (1979) and Raphael (1982) — and their lives changed radically when their parents, who were both Scientologists, split up and her father, Jean-Francois Paris, decided to join the church’s Sea Org in England. At only 6 years of age, Valeska was put into a former Scientology organization known as the “Cadet Org.” (Her sibs joined too — Melissa was only 4, and Raphael barely 2, she points out.)*

*Her sister, Melissa, has written that the Cadet Org was a sort of “mini Sea Org,” where even the youngest children were treated like future hardcore church workers, and were “assigned all sorts of manual labor: scrubbing walls, floors, cleaning the toilets…not stuff that kids would normally do.” (We’re going to be interviewing Melissa, who has her own story to tell about growing up in Scientology and living in a family torn apart by the church.)*

*Scientology believes that each of us has lived countless lives over billions of years — our souls, which Scientology calls “thetans,” are ancient, and so even when we inhabit a new body in a new life, as a child, there is actually an adult soul inside.*

*“We were just future Sea Org members that needed to be molded into ‘good’ SO members which meant breaking us down into robots,” Melissa writes.*

*Valeska did join the Sea Org, at only 14 years old, signing its standard billion-year contract, promising to come back, lifetime after lifetime, to serve the church by working incredible hours for only 50 dollars a week.*
