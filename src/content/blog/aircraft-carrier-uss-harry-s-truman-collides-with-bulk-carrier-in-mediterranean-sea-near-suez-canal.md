![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/truman.jpg)[USS *Harry S. Truman* (CVN-75)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Harry_S._Truman), flagship of the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, collided with [M/V *Besiktas-M*](https://www.classnk.or.jp/register/regships/one_dsp.aspx?imo=9291365), a 53,00 DWT bulk carrier, on Wednesday evening near Port Said, Egypt, in the Mediterranean Sea, the Navy said Thursday.

The incident occurred near Port Said, Egypt, at approximately 11:46 p.m. local time, Cmdr. Timothy Gorman, U.S. Sixth Fleet spokesperson, said in a brief statement Thursday.

The collision “did not endanger” the Truman, as no injuries or flooding were reported, Gorman said.

“The propulsion plants are unaffected and in a safe and stable condition,” Gorman said.

The damage is above the waterline of the carrier, a Navy official told [USNI News](https://news.usni.org/2025/02/13/breaking-uss-harry-s-truman-collides-with-merchant-vessel-in-mediterranean-sea). No aircraft aboard the deck were damaged, another Navy official said.

Most details are lacking regarding the collision, which appears to have taken place in congested waters at the northern end of the Suez Canal near Port Said. According to AIS, the bulk carrier M/V *Besiktas-M* had transited the canal northbound in the hours before the collision, bound for the Black Sea port of Constanta, Romania. The carrier, which appears not to have been operating under AIS, was reported to have been traveling southbound toward the canal. 

 The *Truman* is a [Nimitz-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier), nuclear-powered, aircraft carrier with a crew of 5,000. The supercarrier can accommodate around 90 aircraft and has a flight deck 4.5 acres in size.

The M/V *Besiktas-M* previously collided with M/V *Common Spirit* in August 2016 in the Bangladesh port city of Chittagong, according to the ship-tracking site [Vessel Tracker](https://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Besiktas-m-9291365.html).

The last known collision between a carrier and a merchant vessel was on July 22, 2004, when the former USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) collided with a small dhow in the Persian Gulf during night helicopter operations, according to USNI News.
