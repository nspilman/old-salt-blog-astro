*“Tattoo Tales” is just one part of a weekend full of special activities. The event is a celebration of the Museum’s newest exhibit [Skin & Bones – Tattoos in the Life of the American Sailor](http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&page_id=70E348D7-1E4F-379B-603108B03A280244). The critically-acclaimed exhibit traces the purpose and meaning of tattooing for the American sailor from the Revolutionary War up to the present time.* 

*Children can enjoy tattoo story times; they can try their hand at designing their own tattoo; and they can even get their own temporary tattoo. Face painters and henna tattoo artists will be on hand to decorate the faces and limbs of those who wish to do so.* 

*Special interpreted tours of the Skin & Bones exhibit will be offered to provide interested visitors an in-depth presentation of the history of tattoos in the maritime community and beyond. In addition, panels of local tattoo artists will discuss their work and display their designs both days at 1:30 p.m. in the Greenmanville Church.*

*Tattoos & Tallships is free with Museum admission.* 

*Skin & Bones was funded in part by a grant from the Connecticut Humanities Council. The exhibit runs through Sept. 5.*
