A brand new copy of a 4,000 year old craft was paddled out on a short maiden voyage in Falmouth, Cornwall on Wednesday. Christened the *Morgawr* after a mythical monster of Falmouth Bay, she is a 50 foot long, six-ton replica of a Bronze Age boat, which was built by a team of 50 volunteers over the last eleven months at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall.

*Getting his feet wet with the rest of the crew yesterday was Professor Robert Van de Noort from the University of Exeter, who has overseen the project. A world expert in Bronze Age boats, he said: “I’m so happy with her responsiveness. When I was steering, I could turn her easily. Today’s launch has revolutionised everything we knew.”*   *The build and launch represent the beginning of a wider educational project to study the mobility of Bronze Age people.*
