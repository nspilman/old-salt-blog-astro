![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/americianqueen.jpg)The [Hornblower Group](https://www.hornblowercorp.com/); a diversified ferry, cruise, marine hospitality, and services organization; has [filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hornblower-group-to-be-acquired-and-receive-significant-new-equity-investment-302067034.html). The filing is expected to help cut the company’s debt load by $720 million. The company enters bankruptcy with assets of up to $1 billion and liabilities of roughly $1.2 billion. Its debt load rose from $630 million in 2019 as the business tried to maintain liquidity during the pandemic.

In the voluntary court-supervised and pre-arranged bankruptcy, [Strategic Value Partners](https://www.svpglobal.com/), LLC (SVP), a global alternative investment firm, will acquire majority ownership of Hornblower in a proposed debt-for-equity swap while providing a significant equity investment in the business.

As part of the agreement, Hornblower’s overnight cruising business, [American Queen Voyages](https://www.aqvinfo.com/) (AQV) will be shut down, and sold if possible. American Queen Voyages operated the *[American Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Queen)*, said to be the largest river steamboat ever built, as well as the *[American Countess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Countess)*, the *[American Duchess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Duchess),* and the *[American Empress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Empress)*.

In a [press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hornblower-group-to-be-acquired-and-receive-significant-new-equity-investment-302067034.html) the company asserted that except for American Queen Voyages, Hornblower’s current services will not be impacted in any way by the transaction.

The similarly-named, though completely separate U.S. river and coastal cruise company, [American Cruise Lines](https://www.cruisecritic.com/find-a-cruise/cruise-line-american-cruise-lines), remains fully operational.
