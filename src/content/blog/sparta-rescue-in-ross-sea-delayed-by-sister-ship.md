Russian Fishing Vessel Sparta

The plan was for the [South Korean icebreaker *Araon*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Araon) accompanied by the fishing vessel *Chiyo Maru No 3* to break through the ice to reach the stricken Russian fishing vessel *Sparta* today on Christmas Day. The [*Sparta* was holed below the waterline by ice a week ago last Friday in the Ross Sea](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/16/russian-fishing-vessel-sparta-listing-after-striking-sea-ice-in-antarctica/) off Antarctica. The rescue plan has broken down as *Chiyo Maru No 3*, a sister ship to the *Sparta*, has had to turn back as it proved to be too slow and incapable of passing through the ice even with the assistance of the icebreaker *Araon*. The *Aroan* is escorting the *Chiyo Maru No 3* back to open water and is now expected to reach the Sparta on Monday. The delay due to the sister ship [once again raises the question of why non-ice strengthened fishing vessels have been granted permits](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/19/stricken-fishing-vessel-sparta-not-fit-for-antarctic-ice/) to fish in the heavy ice of the Ross Sea.
