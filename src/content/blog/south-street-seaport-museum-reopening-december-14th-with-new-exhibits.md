![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/150.jpg)The [South Street Seaport Museum](http://www.southstreetseaportmuseum.org/Default.asp) is reopening on Friday, December 14 with the launch of two new exhibitions –  *A Fisherman’s Dream: Folk Art* by Mario Sanchez and *Street Shots/NYC*, a presentation of contemporary New York City street photography. They will join ongoing special exhibitions *Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions*, organized by the American Folk Art Museum, and *Romancing New York*: Watercolors by Frederick Brosen.

“*Superstorm Sandy may have dealt us a body blow but we are getting back up on our feet: today we’re proud to announce that the Museum is ready to reopen and with fantastic new exhibitions. In large part, we are re-opening as a statement of faith in our mission and community, and visitors will have to use stairs and accept heat blown-in from heaters sitting on the sidewalk. But we are ready to welcome all comers*,” said Susan Henshaw Jones, President of the South Street Seaport Museum.
