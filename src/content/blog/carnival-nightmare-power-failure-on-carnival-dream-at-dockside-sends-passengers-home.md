![CarnivalDream_t607](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/03/CarnivalDream_t607.jpg)The story sounds disturbingly familiar – a Carnival cruise ship with generator problems, overflowing toilets and passengers sent home from an interrupted cruise. The good new is that [the generator failure on the *Carnival Dream*](http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/14/travel/cruise-ship-trouble/index.html), the largest cruise ship operated by Carnival Cruise Line, occurred on Wednesday while the ship was dockside at Philipsburg, St. Maarten, in the eastern Caribbean.  The power has said to be restored to the ship but the ship is still unable to sail.  Passengers onboard the ship will be flown home rather than completing the remainder of their cruise back to Florida.  The ship’s next voyage which was scheduled to depart on Saturday, March 16 has also been cancelled.  The ship is reported to have suffered some sort of damage to its electrical system following a test of the emergency generator.

Last month, the [*Carnival Triumph*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/02/engine-room-fire-strands-carnival-triumph-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-will-be-towed-to-mexico/) suffered a total power failure after a fire in one engine in the after engine room.  The ship was left adrift in the Gulf of Mexico and passengers spent four days without power before the ship could be towed to Mobile, AL.  In late 2010, the Carnival Splendor, sister-ship to the ill fated *Costa Concordia*, suffered a similar fate in the Pacific when an after engine room fire disabled the ship which was without power for three days until it was towed into San Diego. In just over the last two years, at least eight diesel-electric powered cruise ships have blacked out by damage to their electrical distribution systems. Five of these ships; the [*Carnival Splendor*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/carnival-splendor-catches-fire-off-mexico-ship-dead-in-the-water/), the [RMS *Queen Mary 2,*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/03/fire-on-the-mv-azamara-quest-only-the-latest-failure-on-modern-diesel-electric-cruise-ships/) the [*Costa Allegra*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/02/cruise-ship-costa-allegra-adrift-off-seychelles/), the [*Carnival Triumph*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/02/carnival-triumph-another-blacked-out-drifting-cruise-ship-why-again-a-common-design-flaw-in-modern-cruise-ships/) and now the [*Carnival Dream*](http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/14/travel/cruise-ship-trouble/index.html); have been operated by Carnival or its subsidiaries.
