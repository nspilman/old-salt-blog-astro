![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/02/tankerodessa.jpg)[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moldovan-flagged-tanker-hit-by-missile-ukraine-coast-2022-02-25/) is reporting that Russian warships shelled *Millennial Spirit*, a Moldovan-flagged chemical tanker, and *Namura Queen*, a Panamanian-flagged cargo ship due to load grain near Odessa port in the Black Sea on Friday, one day after Russia began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  A total of three non-military vessels have now been hit since the start of the invasion. On Thursday, the [Turkish-owned *Yasa Jupiter* cargo ship](https://www.reuters.com/world/turkish-owned-ship-hit-by-bomb-off-coast-odessa-no-casualties-turkish-authority-2022-02-24/) was struck off Odessa.

Ukraine’s infrastructure ministry said that the *Millennial Spirit* was carrying 600 tonnes of diesel at the time of the attack from a Russian military ship.

Earlier on Friday Moldova’s naval agency said the crew of the *Millennial Spirit* was Russian and that two of them had been seriously injured.
