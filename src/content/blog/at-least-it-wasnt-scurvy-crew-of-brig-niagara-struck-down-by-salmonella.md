![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/niagra-150x100.jpg)Last week, twenty six of forty two crew members on the [*Brig Niagara*](http://flagshipniagara.org/flagship_niagara/index.htm) were sickened by salmonella,  forcing the ship to cut short a visit to a tall ships festival in Cleveland.   Fortunately, the crew is reported to have recovered, and the *[Niagara](http://flagshipniagara.org/flagship_niagara/index.htm)* set sail again Monday for Duluth, Minn.   The *[Niagara](http://flagshipniagara.org/flagship_niagara/index.htm)* is a replica of the ship that Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry used to defeat the British at the Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812.
