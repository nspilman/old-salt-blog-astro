We [posted recently about the discovery of the 164′ Japanese fishing vessel, Ryou-Un Maru](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/03/24/japanese-fishing-trawler-carried-away-by-tsunami-found-drifting-toward-british-columbia/), which had been carried out to sea from the port of Hachinohe, a year ago by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The ship was found drifting 120 miles off Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada.  The ship continued to drift at about one knot toward the North American coast.

The US Coast Guard decided that the drifting ship, with no lights or communications, was a hazard to navigation and dispatched [US Coast Guard Cutter *Anacapa*](http://cgvi.uscg.mil/media/main.php?g2_itemId=1587668) to sink the ship with cannon fire.  As the Coast Guard was readying to fire on the vessel, a Canadian fishing vessel, the 62-foot *Bernice C*, claimed salvage rights over the ghost ship in international waters.  
  
The Cutter *Anacapa* held its fire and stood down to allow the Canadian crew an opportunity to take the stricken ship in tow.  It became evident, however, that the *Bernice C* lacked the horsepower to tow the drifting ship. After giving the *Bernice C* time to clear the area, the Cutter *Anacapa* opened fire on the derelict fishing boat with high explosive ammunition.  Following the firing, the *Anacapa* doused the fires set on the fishing boat and accelerated the sinking by filling the derelict with water.  The fishing vessel sank in 6,072 feet of water 180 miles west of the Southeast Alaskan coast. The [Coast Guard reports](http://coastguardnews.com/coast-guard-sinks-derelict-japanese-vessel/2012/04/06/) that “*light sheening and minimal debris have been reported from the sinking of the vessel, and the sheening is expected to quickly dissipate at sea*.”
