While [pre-trial hearings are underway](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/16/us-concordia-hearing-idUSBRE89F18720121016) in an Italian court, an Italian-American engineering consortium has begun salvage operations to remove the cruise ship, partially capsized off the island of Giglio.  It will be the first time a ship of this size has been salvalged in one piece. Already six months behind schedule, the engineering challenges of salvaging the Costa Concordia are huge.
