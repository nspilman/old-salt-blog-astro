Peter Maddison, right

Just as preparations for moving the world’s oldest surviving clipper ship, the *[City of Adelaide](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/28/clipper-ship-city-of-adelaide-to-be-sent-to-australia/)*, to her namesake city in Australia, are getting underway, Peter Maddison, a former councillor from Sunderland, where the ship was built, has occupied the old clipper, again.  Maddison had previously staged a [short occupation in 2009](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8303072.stm) when it appeared that the ship might by scrapped.  In 2009 he gave up his occupation when he ran short of provisions. [This time, he has told BBC Scotland,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-17174721)  that he is stocked for a  “sustained occupation.”  
  
After nearly being scrapped by the [Scottish Maritime Museum](http://www.scottishmaritimemuseum.org/), which currently owns the vessel,  two groups vied to rescue the 1864 built composite clipper ship – the Scottish [Sunderland City of Adelaide Recovery Foundation](http://www.cityofadelaide1864.co.uk/index.php?page=scarf) and the [City of Adelaide Preservation Trust](http://cityofadelaide.org.au/)  based in Australia.  In August of 2010, Scottish Culture Minister, [Fiona Hyslop announced that a bid from the Australian Preservation Trust](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/28/clipper-ship-city-of-adelaide-to-be-sent-to-australia/)had been selected and that ship would be moved to Australia.

Since then a 100 tonne steel cradle to support the 148 year old ship has been pre-fabricated in Australia and shipped to Scotland to be assembled under the ship prior to transport.  Plans were that the [ship could be ready to be be moved](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/19/the-clipper-ship-city-of-adelaide-ready-by-march-for-transport-to-australia/) first by barge and then heavy lift vessel on her way back to Australia by some time in March.  When Maddison’s current “occupation” impacts these plans remains to be seen.
