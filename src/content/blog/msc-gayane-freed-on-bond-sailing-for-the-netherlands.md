Last week, US Customs and Border Patrol seized the [container ship MSC *Gayane,*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/06/the-bizarre-smuggling-scheme-on-msc-gayane/) following the seizure of 18,000 kilograms of cocaine, worth an estimated $1.3 billion, by Federal agents while at the dock in the Port of Philadelphia in late June. Now, the ship has sailed for Rotterdam, the scheduled next port of call after Philadelphia. 

[American Shipper](http://www.americanshipper.com/news/msc-gayane-allowed-to-sail?autonumber=849173) reports that William McSwain, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, [announced](https://twitter.com/USAttyMcSwain/status/1149731872601190403) via Twitter on Friday that his office secured $10 million in cash and a $40 million surety bond from the owner and operator of the *MSC Gayane* in exchange for its temporary release pending a final resolution of a lawsuit involving the ship.

[World Maritime News](https://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/280162/msc-gayane-released-on-usd-50-mn-bond/) is reporting that the cash and the bond were paid by vessel owner J.P. Morgan and operator Mediterranean Shipping Company. See our previous post, [Who Owns MSC Gayane? Does it Matter?](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/07/update-who-owns-msc-gayane-does-it-matter/)
