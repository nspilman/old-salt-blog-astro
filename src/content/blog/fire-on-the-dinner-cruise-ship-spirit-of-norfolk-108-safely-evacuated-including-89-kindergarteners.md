Fortunately, all passengers were accounted for and there were no reported injuries. All passengers were evacuated to the excursion boat *Victory Rover* which ferried them to shore.

Two crew members remained on the *Spirit of Norfolk* to assist the firefighters and shortly afterward the vessel was towed to Pier 4 at the naval base.

“It is very deep-seated, very complex, and very difficult to extinguish,” said Tony Sickell, Naval Station Norfolk Fire Chief, describing the fire during an afternoon press conference. “We are doing everything that we possibly can right now to cool the hull and to get water to the seat of the fire in the engine room where we believe it possibly started.”

The fire continued burning in the evening and into Wednesday. The [Coast Guard said in a statement issued today](https://www.norfolk.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=6111):

*Crews are continuing firefighting measures to extinguish the fire. Due to ongoing firefighting operations, the vessel is considered too unstable for crews to enter, however, exterior firefighting measures continue. Based on the instability of the ship, salvage contractors are developing a plan to safely enter the ship*.

Built in 1992, the *Spirit of Norfolk* accommodates up to nearly 500 passengers and is owned by the California-based Hornblower Group.
