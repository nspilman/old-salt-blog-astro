Congratulations to the Capt. Shane Granger, Meggi Macoun, Joanne Har and all the good folks on the [historic vessel *Vega*](http://www.sailvega.com/) for being honored with the Asia Pacific Laureate Foundation annual award for Social Services in recognition of “Humanitarian Services to Isolated Island Communities.”  
  
![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/01/vegaaward.jpg)Capt. Shane Granger writes in the current [Vega Newsletter](http://www.sailvega.com/newsletters/november2010/december.html): *This prestigious award came as a complete surprise to us. We were not even aware we had been proposed for it. Meggi and I were given this award in recognition of Humanitarian Services to Isolated Island Communities. We are very excited about it. As our friend Capt. Marty says, “Great news mate , you and Meggi really deserve this award”. But, as we see it this award should really go to our sponsors such as Jotun Paints, QBE Insurance, ModuSpec, and Scandinavian Bunkering along with all our individual supporters. Together they make our work possible. Without them we simply could not help the communities we assist in a meaningful manner.*

More about the *Vega* from her [website](http://www.sailvega.com):

*Built in 1893-94, for over 100 years VEGA carried cargos of bricks, building stone, pig iron, and cement through some of the world’s roughest seas. Built for the North Sea and certified for Arctic trade, VEGA was famous for her strength and ability to carry loads other boats her size could not. Baltic traders like VEGA made some very impressive voyages including immigrants to North America and cargos to the Mediterranean, Africa and the Caribbean, some rounding Cape Horn to trade with Chile.*

*VEGA had two very distinguished careers, one in Norway where she was built and another in Sweden where she became the famous “VEGA of Bergkvara”. Now she has embarked on a career carrying cargos of donated medical and educational supplies on the South East monsoon to isolated island communities in East Timor and Indonesia. During the North East Monsoon VEGA visits Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand gathering donated supplies and attracting attention to the needs of the communities she assists.*

*VEGA* is supported by sponsors, volunteers, and donations. To learn more about supporting their good work, visit their [website](http://www.sailvega.com/) or [click here](http://www.sailvega.com/vega/support.php).    Read about the *Vega* [on their blog](http://sailvega.wordpress.com/)*.*

A recent article about the *Vega*‘s activities:

[*Vega* calls at ports with cargoes of hope](http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/14batt/Article)

*PORT KLANG: The stories of grown-ups shedding tears, overwhelmed by emotion when they received simple farming tools and basic supplies from the crew of Vega Valletta, a 118-year-old Norwegian ship, speaks volumes about its altruistic mission.*
