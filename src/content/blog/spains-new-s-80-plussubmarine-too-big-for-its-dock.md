![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/s80plus.jpg)Spain’s [S-80 Plus submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-80-class_submarine) is an advanced design featuring [Air Independent Propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-independent_propulsion "Air-independent propulsion")  (AIP), which is reported to have cost around € 1 billion. The original design came in overweight, so it necessary to lengthen the submarine by 10 meters.  Now, it appears that the newly delivered [sub is too large for the Spanish naval dock](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/991250/Spain-submarine-S80-navy-Cartagena-Nato-defence) at Cartagena. The dock will require dredging and an extension. Oops.

Three more submarines of the class are under construction in the Spanish shipyard [Navantia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navantia "Navantia") in Cartagena.
