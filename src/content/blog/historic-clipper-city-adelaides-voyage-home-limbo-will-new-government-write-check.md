The clipper ship [*City of Adelaide*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Adelaide_\(1864\)) is supposed to be transported by heavy-lift ship back to Australia in the near future. Scottish taxpayers have already chipped in $1.2 million.  The [City of Adelaide Trust](http://cityofadelaide.org.au/), however, has been unable to book the heavy-lift ship because the government of Australia has not delivered on a promised $850,000 contribution toward the transportation. It is possible that the funds may not be forthcoming at all.  The problem is that Labor Party was voted out in the recent election and a new Coalition is in power.  The new Environment Minister Greg Hunt is now asking for more information about the project’s cost and “heritage values” before making any commitment.   Questioning the “heritage value” of the historic ship at this late date is extremely disturbing.

*Port Adelaide Enfield Mayor Gary Johanson urged Mr Hunt to make a speedy decision on the City of Adelaide project. “This would be a major disgrace for not only Port Adelaide but for Australia if the Federal Government does not follow through with this funding commitment,” Mr Johanson said.*

There are also reports that the historic ship will not actually return to its namesake port city but instead will be moored in an area described as “the backwaters” of the Port River.

*Councillor Bruce Johansen said the site was “in the backwaters” of the Port River.  “So much money has been spent getting the City of Adelaide to Port Adelaide and it was meant to be a big attraction for the area, but instead it looks like it will now just lay derelict in an area no one will visit,” Cr Johansen said.  “I am very disappointed with the site that has been allocated to the ship.*
