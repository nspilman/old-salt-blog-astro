*Gipsy Moth IV*, the yacht that [Sir Francis Chichester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Chichester) singlehanded around the world is for sale for £250,000.  Chichester was the first person to sail single-handed around the world by the three capes, the route taken by the clipper ships.  He completed the voyage in *Gipsy Moth IV* in nine months and one day.  While brokers have suggested that there is considerable interest in the historic yacht, Chichester himself was not in love with it, saying, ‘*She is cantankerous and difficult and needs a crew of three – a man to navigate, an elephant to move the tiller and a 3ft 6in chimpanzee with arms 8ft long to get about below and work the gear*.’
