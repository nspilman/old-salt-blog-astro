VLCC MV Irene SL

Yesterday, the [Italian-owned Aframax tanker MV *Savina Caylyn* was hijacked](http://www.eunavfor.eu/2011/02/italian-oil-tanker-pirated-in-the-indian-ocean/) by pirates approximately 670 nautical miles East of Socotra Island in the Indian Ocean.  Today, the [Greek-owned VLCC *MV Irene SL*](http://www.eunavfor.eu/2011/02/mv-irene-sl-pirated-in-the-north-arabian-sea/) was hijacked  approximately 350 nautical miles South East of Muscat in the North Arabian Sea.  The last VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier), the [Korean *Samho Dream,* hijacked by pirates](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/11/2010116231624431468.html) was freed after a record ransom of $9.5 million was paid by its owners.   Western naval efforts to stop piracy in the region continue to be less and less effective as the pirates have adapted their tactics while the naval forces have not.
