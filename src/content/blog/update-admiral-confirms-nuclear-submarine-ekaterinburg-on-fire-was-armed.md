![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wd2.jpg)Last week [we posted about a report](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/02/14/ekaterinburg-submarine-fire-the-brink-of-the-biggest-catastrophe-since-chernobyl/) by to the Russian magazine *[Vlast](http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1867264)*  that claimed that “*Russia \[was\] … on the verge of the largest man-made disaster since Chernobyl”* when a fire broke out on December 29th, 2011 on the K-84 *Ekaterinburg*, a Russian nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, in a dry-dock in Murmansk.

Despite claims by the Russian Defense Ministry that the submarine’s weapons had been removed prior to entering the drydock, *Vlast* said that the submarine was fully armed with 16 R-29 intercontinental ballistic missiles, each armed with four nuclear warheads as well as up to 12 torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles, each tipped with either 300 kilograms of high-power military explosive or a nuclear warhead.

Now, the Deputy Commander of the Northern Fleet, Vice Admiral Aleksander Vitko, has confirmed  that the submarine was brought into dock outside Murmansk without first having the weapons removed.  Sparks from welding were reported to have set fire to wooden scaffolding which spread to the rubber acoustic coating on the submarine’s hull. If any of the torpedoes had exploded, it is likely that they could have set off the fuel in the ballistic missiles or damaged the nuclear reactors.

*Immediately after the fire broke out Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that all weapons had been unloaded from the submarine before she was taken into the dry dock for repair. Earlier this month Kommersant reported that the fire could have developed into the worst anthropogenic catastrophe since Chernobyl, as the submarine had up to 16 intercontinental “Sineva” missiles, each carrying four nuclear warheads, and 12 torpedoes on board when the fire broke out, as BarentsObserver wrote.*

*Norway’s Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre last week [instructed](http://barentsobserver.custompublish.com/stoere-wants-answer-on-possible-nukes.5022236-16149.html) the Norwegian Embassy in Moscow to hand over a inquiry to Russian authorities to get an answer on whether or not the submarine did have nuclear weapons. “It is a clear obligation in the warning agreement between Norway and Russia from 1993, to have full openness about such events when they happen, ”Støre said.*

*According to the first official reports from the accident the fire only harmed the outer rubber coating of the submarine. Soon [pictures](http://www.barentsobserver.com/submarines-torpedo-compartment-was-on-fire.5003663-116320.html) and [videos](http://barentsobserver.custompublish.com/videos-from-submarine-fire.5004528-16149.html) began appearing on blogs and social media that showed the fire was far more severe than the officials said.*

*According to Lifenews the firefighters that were sent in to put out the fire were not even informed that the submarine had torpedoes on board. Torpedo fuel is highly flammable and extremely toxic.*
