![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/05/ecoclipper.jpg)[Ecoclipper](https://ecoclipper.org/about/) has announced that with the maiden voyage of the recently refitted [*De Tukke*](https://ecoclipper.org/fleet/tukker/), their emission-free short-sea Western European liner service has begun.

From their [press release](https://ecoclipper.org/News/press-release-sail-cargo-company-ecoclipper-on-maiden-voyage/): *De Tukker*, the first ship operated by the sail cargo company Ecoclipper, has set sail. Leaving Amsterdam carrying chocolate, 5 crew members, and 5 trainees, *De Tukker* is headed for Porto where she is expected to arrive around May 13th and take on a cargo of wine and olive oil. This is the first voyage on a sailing schedule which will see the ship sail on a regular route across North and West Europe.

Following a refit and sea trials, *De Tukker*, which was built in 1912 and has seen life as a coastal trader and sail training vessel, is now propelled again by over 300 square meters of sail. *De Tukker* is able to carry about 70 cubic meters, or an equivalent of 50-70 tons, of cargo. She also has accommodation for up to 12 trainees or travelers. The ship is handling well and is currently crossing the Bay of Biscay. 

The first cargo onboard is chocolate produced by Dutch chocolate maker “Chocolatemakers” and destined for European distribution by sail cargo brokers “New Dawn Traders”. The cacao used in the chocolate’s production process was shipped from the Dominican Republic by fellow sail cargo vessel *Tres Hombres* and so will reach consumers with a minimum of harmful emissions produced in its transport.

*De Tukker*’s currently scheduled destinations are Porto, Noirmoutier, Saint Nazaire, Penzance, Torquay and London, however, depending on the needs of exporters and consumers EcoClipper is open to adding additional ports to the route.

[Jorne Langelaan](https://ecoclipper.org/media/), EcoClipper founder and CEO, has expressed his excitement that *De Tukker* is now sailing again. “After a year-long period of expert refitting by our own refit crew and the crew of the Talsma shipyard, it was with the greatest pleasure that I watched De Tukker sail off towards the horizon. This is the next step in returning to large scale transport by sailing vessel at sea.”

There is still cargo space available for exporters who want to take advantage of this new shipping option in Northern and Western Europe. Visit the EcoClipper website for more information [www.ecoclipper.org](https://ecoclipper.org/).

EcoClipper, founded in 2018, was created in response to the successes of the sail cargo industry. EcoClipper envisions more sailing vessels transporting cargo around the world, taking passengers along the way and educating trainees in traditional maritime skills.

Over the last few years, EcoClipper has developed a large online network and worked on completing a design for the first EcoClipper ship series – the EcoClipper500. The company is also expanding to include retrofit vessels – these are smaller than the EcoClipper500 series and will operate on tailored routes.

> De Tukker is a sustainable sailing cargo ship with a rich history. Built in 1912, she was a Dutch sail training vessel and joined the EcoClipper fleet in 2022. She carries 50-70 tonnes of cargo and operates in the North Sea and beyond.
