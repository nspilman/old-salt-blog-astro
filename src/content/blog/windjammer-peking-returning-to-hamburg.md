![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Peking_ship_combined.jpg)Good, if rather bittersweet, news for those of us around New York harbor. The [windjammer *Peking*, a fixture of New York’s South Street Seaport for over 40 years, will be returning to its original home port in Hamburg, Germany](http://www.ndr.de/kultur/kunst/Bund-gibt-Millionen-fuer-Hamburger-Hafenmuseum-,hafenmuseum104.html) for restoration and display. The steel-hulled four-masted barque built in 1911 will be the centerpiece of a new Hamburg harbor museum for which the German government has allocated 120 million euros. A reported 30 million euros are allocated to transport and restore the [*Peking*.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_\(ship\))

*[Peking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_\(ship\))* was one of the last generation of the great windjammers — iron and steel ships built as bulk carriers to sail the long windy passages around Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope where steamships could not economically operate. *Peking* was one of the [Flying-P Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner), owned and operated by the German shipping company [F. Laeisz of Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Laeisz). They continued building steel sailing ships into the mid-1920s. *Peking* carried wheat and nitrates around Cape Horn between 1911 and 1932, when she was converted to a children’s home and training school. In 1975, the ship was acquired by New York’s [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/) and brought to New York.

In recent years, the South Street Seaport Museum has faced a series of financial and management crises. The museum also suffered major damage from flooding during Hurricane Sandy.  While the *Peking* and the museum’s other ships successfully rode out the hurricane, the museum found itself with more ships than it could care for. As we posted recently, the [Seaport Museum is now undertaking a $10.6 million restoration of the 1885 built iron-hulled windjammer](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/11/restoring-the-1885-windjammer-wavetree/) *[Wavertree](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/11/restoring-the-1885-windjammer-wavetree/).* Sadly for the *Peking,* the museum has lacked the money to maintain the ship and lacks the dock space to display both it and the *Wavertree*.  There were suggestions that the Peking might be sold for scrap if an alternate home could not be found for the historic ship. The funding for the new Hamburg harbor museum appears to have saved the ship from the scrap yard.  The *Peking* is expected to be transported across the Atlantic to Hamburg in the spring, probably as deck cargo aboard a heavy-lift ship.

Including *Peking*, four of the original Flying-P Liners survive today. The *Pommern* is a museum ship in Mariehamn, Finland. The *Passat* is a museum ship in Lübeck’s sea resort Travemünde, Germany and the *Padua*, renamed *Kruzenshtern*, is still sailing as a school ship under the Russian flag.
