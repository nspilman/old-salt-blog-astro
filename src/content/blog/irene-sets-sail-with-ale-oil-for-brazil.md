![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cropped-irene-sky-dreams2.jpg)The ketch *[Irene](http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/pictures/Irene-Bridgwater-sets-sail-Rio-Brazil-photo/pictures-15233397-detail/pictures.html)*, built in 1907 to carry bricks and tiles, has set sail with a cargo of Devon ale for Brittany and Spanish olive oil for  Brazil, on what will be, if all goes well, a five month voyage which will also carry cocoa, coffee, Amazonian “superfoods” and rum from South America and the Caribbean back to the UK.   The venture is being run by the [New Dawn Traders](http://newdawntraders.wordpress.com/) in association with [TransOceanic Wind Transport](http://www.towt.eu/en/).

*The project, [New Dawn Traders](http://newdawntraders.wordpress.com/), was hatched by Jamie Pike, a Bristol environmentalist and champion of the slow food movement. He wanted to find a way of bringing goods back from South America under sail and approached Irene’s owner, Leslie Morrish, a retired psychiatrist who spent years restoring the vessel and keeping it at sea.* 

*The finances did not add up: it would have cost Pike £100,000 to charter the boat, a sum he simply did not have, but then Irene’s captain, Laurance Ottley, met someone in the olive oil business and came up with the idea of sailing a consignment out to Brazil (which has a growing appetite for luxury goods thanks to a booming economy) and letting Pike fill the boat up with goods for the return trip.*

The 32 meter cargo carrying brigantine *[Tres Hombres](http://svtreshombres.homestead.com/Index.html)*, operated by [Fairtransport](http://www.fairtransport.eu/) in partnership with  [TransOceanic Wind Transport](http://www.towt.eu/en/), will be calling in Bonaire today through the 17th and is sponsoring an “open house.”
