From our previous post, [Belated Happy 100th Birthday Wishes to Bill King, World War II Sub Commander and Adventurer](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/28/belated-happy-100th-birthday-wishes-to-bill-king-world-war-ii-sub-commander-and-adventurer/) of June 2010:

*We are five  days late but nevertheless would like to wish [Commander William Donald Aelian “Bill” King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_King_\(Royal_Navy_officer\)) a most happy 100th birthday.  He is only living submarine commander from World War II.  He initially served on the battleship, [HMS Resolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Resolution_\(09\)), and later becoming commanding officer of [HMS Snapper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Snapper_\(39S\)), an S class submarine and then of [HMS Trusty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Trusty_\(N45\)) and [HMS Telemachus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Telemachus_\(P321\)), both T class submarines. During the war, he was promoted to Commander and awarded seven medals.*

*Later, at age 58, King  became the oldest competitor in the [Sunday Times Golden Globe Race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Times_Golden_Globe_Race), the first round the world solo yacht race.   Sailing a junk rigged schooner,the Galway Blazer II, he was dismasted in the South Atlantic. He succeeded in cirumnavigating single handed on his third attempt in 1973, despite a collsion with a whale or large shark which almost sank  his boat.*
