![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ussconstitutionboston.jpg)If you are among the hundreds of millions locked down during the current coronavirus outbreak and would like to get out, even virtually, you might want to take a virtual tour of the [USS *Constitution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution), also known as Old Ironsides.  

Actually, there are at least two virtual tours to choose from. In normal times, there are daily public tours onboard the historic ship. To help limit the spread of the virus, these tours have been suspended until further notice. There is, however, currently a [live virtual tour available at 1PM ET every day on *Facebook*.](https://www.facebook.com/ussconstitutionofficial/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&eid=ARAMM1A6K0knv0dGDtDNRQOdw0o7exM15phlv8E7QUMjGQWignr-NjzDEytgN_jgWVj-Uc4t_2SC4jS2)  As the tour guides lead you virtually through the warship, you can ask questions by posting in the comment section.

If you can’t make the live video tours, Google Maps has a [self-guided virtual tour of the ship](https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3725383,-71.0566157,3a,75y,323.28h,90.1t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sAF1QipMATQqmtjAcc3vhnjEqnffU8hV3lwdpHoagICj9!2e10!3e12!7i13312!8i6656) that lets you wander about using either your keyboard or mouse and to jump between decks with a single click.

The *Constitution* is a wooden-hulled, three-masted United States Navy heavy frigate, launched in 1797. Alongside at Pier One of the former Charlestown Navy Yard, she is the world’s oldest commissioned naval vessel afloat.
