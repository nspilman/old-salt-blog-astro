![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ragland.jpg)I’ve always been a fan of Baltic traders.  They were serious working craft.  They aren’t  necessarily graceful but do possess a certain robust beauty.  The schooner *[W N Ragland](http://www.wnragland.com/index.html)**,* a Baltic trader built in 1913, converted to a yacht, is for sale. For 35 years the schooner was owned by Neil Young, the singer best known as a member of the group [Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosby,_Stills,_Nash_&_Young).   She was sold a few years ago and is back on the market again for $695,000.  Last year, fellow CSN&Y singer, [David Crosby, put his Alden schooner Mayan](http://www.sailtimechannelislands.com/california-sailing/david-crosby-is-selling-his-alden-schooner-called-mayan/) on the market as well.    Hard not to be reminded of the lyric from the Crosby Stills and Nash song, [“](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqJ6X82-Y7w)*[Wooden Ships](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqJ6X82-Y7w)*[.”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqJ6X82-Y7w)

*Wooden ships on the water, very free and easy…*

Wooden ships on the water, regrettably, are never free or even easy. But, damn, they sure are lovely.
