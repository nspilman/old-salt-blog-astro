![vdrelfaro](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/vdrelfaro.jpg)[The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) announced](http://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/PR20160426b.aspx) that “*cargo ship El Faro’s voyage data recorder was located early Tuesday morning in 15,000 feet of water, about 41 miles (36 nautical miles) northeast of Acklins and Crooked Islands, Bahamas, by a team of investigators and scientists using remotely operated undersea search equipment.* 

*The investigative team is comprised of specialists from the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Coast Guard, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Tote Services, the* owner *and operator of El Faro.*

*At about 1 a.m. EDT the team aboard the research vessel Atlantis located the El Faro’s mast where the VDR was mounted. After examining numerous images provided by undersea search equipment, the team positively identified the VDR.*

*“Finding an object about the size of a basketball almost three miles under the surface of the sea is a remarkable achievement,” said NTSB Chairman Christopher A. Hart. “It would not have been possible without the information gained* during *the first survey of the wreckage and the equipment and support provided by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy, the University of Rhode Island, and the many other partners involved in this effort.”*

*The type of VDR mounted on El Faro is capable of recording conversations and sounds on the ship’s navigation bridge, which could provide investigators with important evidence as they seek to understand the sequence of events that led to the sinking.*

*The 790-foot, U.S.-flagged, cargo ship sank October 1, 2015, during Hurricane Joaquin while sailing from Jacksonville, Florida, to San Juan, Puerto Rico. All 33 crewmembers aboard perished in the accident.*”

The search was carried out on the research vessel *[Atlantis](https://www.whoi.edu/main/ships/atlantis)* using the autonomous underwater vehicle, [AUV Sentry](https://www.whoi.edu/main/sentry), which does not have the capacity to retrieve the voyage data recorder. A different remotely operated vehicle will have to be brought to the site to retrieve the VDR.
