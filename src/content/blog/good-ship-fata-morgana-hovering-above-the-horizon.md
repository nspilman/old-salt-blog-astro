![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fatamorgana.jpg)David Morris was taking a walk along the coast near Falmouth, Cornwall, in the UK, when he saw what looked to be a large tanker hovering in the air above the horizon. He documented what he witnessed with several photographs.  Apparently, Mr. Morris saw a “superior mirage” also known as a [Fata Morgana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fata_Morgana_\(mirage\)). 

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-56286719) quotes meteorologist David Braine said the “superior mirage” occurred because of “special atmospheric conditions that bend light”.

He said the illusion is common in the Arctic, but can appear “very rarely” in the UK during winter.

Mr. Morris said he was “stunned” after capturing the picture while looking out to sea from the hamlet of Gillan

Mr. Braine said: “Superior mirages occur because of the weather condition known as a temperature inversion, where cold air lies close to the sea with warmer air above it.

“Since cold air is denser than warm air, it bends light towards the eyes of someone standing on the ground or on the coast, changing how a distant object appears.

Fata Morgana is an Italian term named after the Arthurian sorceress Morgan le Fay, from a belief that these mirages, often seen in the Strait of Messina, were fairy castles in the air or false land created by her witchcraft to lure sailors to their deaths. 

This type of mirage is responsible for all kinds of unusual sightings, from mountains in the middle of the ocean to ships that appear to be flying, and it may even be the source of the legend of the [Flying Dutchman](https://www.farmersalmanac.com/fata-morgana-mirage-28630).
