![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/clamagore.jpg)The [Patriots Point Naval & Maritime Museum](https://www.patriotspoint.org/) in South Carolina has decided after years of debate to scrap [USS *Clamagore*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Clamagore_\(SS-343\)), a Cold War-era submarine, and save some of its artifacts for an exhibit. 

“Unfortunately, we cannot financially sustain the maintenance of three historic vessels,” Rorie Cartier, executive director at Patriots Point, said in a statement after the vote. “The USS *Yorktown* and USS *Laffey* also need repair, and we are fighting a never-ending battle against the corrosion that comes from being submerged in saltwater.”

The $2 million cost to scrap the submarine will come from the museum’s operating budget, officials said.

For several years now, [we have followed the discussion](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/04/reefing-the-patriots-point-submarine-uss-clamagore/) at the [Patriots Point Naval & Maritime Museum](https://www.patriotspoint.org/) about what to do with the World War II era, [USS *Clamagore*.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Clamagore_\(SS-343\)) The 1945 built Balao-class submarine has been an exhibit at the museum in Charleston, SC since 1981, but had become too costly to maintain. In 2019, plans were to [sink the submarine as an artificial reef](http://www.clamagorereef.com/). One 2019 assessment found it would cost “upwards of $9 million” to fully restore and repair the vessel, the museum said.
