![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whg15.jpg)Like so many other organizations, the [Working Harbor Committee](https://www.workingharbor.org/) has had to rethink its annual gala, which raises funds for the organization and honors leaders in the Working Waterfront. This year the [gala will be virtual on Tuesday, October 20, 2020](https://www.workingharbor.org/pdf%20files/flyer2020gala.pdf), from 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

The Working Harbor Committee will be honoring Captain John J. DeCruz, President of the United New York Sandy Hook Pilots, and Captain Brendan L. Foley, President of the United New Jersey Sandy Hook Pilots. The Sandy Hook pilots help container ships bring food and other essential goods into New York Harbor.

At 6:45 p.m., the awards will be presented to our honorees by Gordon Cooper, Chair, Working Harbor Committee.

Featured Guest Speakers will include:

*   Capt. Timothy Ferrie, President of the Marine Society of the City of New York and Full Branch Pilot, Sandy Hook Pilots Association
*   Bethann Rooney, Deputy Port Director, The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey
*   Andrew Genn, Sr. VP of Transportation Dept., NYCEDC
*   Roberta Weisbrod, Director, Worldwide Ferry Safety Association

**Musical Interludes** will include a special appearance at 7:10 p.m. by renowned cabaret artists [Marta Sanders](https://martanyc.com/) & [Mark Nadler](http://www.marknadler.com/about.html)!

Marta and Mark have missed being aboard a Hidden Harbor® boat tour, so they’ll sing for the Gala to keep us afloat!

City Guide NY wrote about a recent Birdland appearance:

“Join award-winning, internationally acclaimed cabaret power houses Mark Nadler and Marta Sanders for an evening of entertainment with a capital E! He plays the piano, sings and tap dances. She blows the roof off the place with her powerful voice. And both of them take the audience an emotional ride from belly laughs to tears to cheers!”

The Working Harbor Committee’s programs engage young people in vital and well-paying careers in the harbor.
