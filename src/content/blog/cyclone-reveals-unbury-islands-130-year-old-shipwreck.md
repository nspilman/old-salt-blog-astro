*The huge cyclone’s intense winds blew away sand on one Queensland island, unearthing the outline of a mysterious shipwreck. It’s a 100-foot (30-meter) longboat, stuck in the sand on Hinchinbrook Island’s beach. The vessel may have been buried under the sand for more than 130 years, reported the Brisbane Times.*  
  
*Yasi blew away about 100 feet (30 m) of sand from a dune that was covering the front of the shipwreck. Just enough sand was swept away to reveal the top 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of the shipwreck.*

*Shipwreck experts are analyzing the ship’s timber to pinpoint its identity. The most likely candidates are three ships that wrecked in shallow water nearby from 1879 to 1880: The Harriet Armytage in 1879, the Charlotte Andrews in 1879 and the Belle in 1880.*
