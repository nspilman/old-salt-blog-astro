![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/08/gs4.jpg)Last August, [we posted about the surprise arrival](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/08/05/mt-pavit-on-juhu-beach-a-security-breach-big-enough-to-drift-a-tanker-through/) of the [tanker MT Pavit](http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/M.t.-Pavit-9016636.html) on Juhu Beach near Mumbai, India.  The tanker had previously been reported to have sunk after engine room flooding.  This was the second ship that had arrived on Juhu Beach unexpectedly last summer.  In June 2011, the [MV Wisdom](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/23/the-folly-of-the-mv-wisdom/), which had been on her way to the ship breakers, also drifted ashore after a tow line broke.

Now the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) is trying to sell the ship but not having much luck. In the first attempt to auction the ship no bid approached the Rs. 4.75 crore (Approximately US$ 850,000) minimum reserve price.  The MMB which maintains that the vessel is in good condition and sea-worthy, is now holding a second auction and hopes to have better luck. The ship’s owner has apparently abandoned the stranded tanker.
