![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/recruits.jpg)The US military has been having problems meeting its recruiting targets. In response, the US Coast Guard and the US Navy have been offering signing bonuses of up to $50,000 for certain billets, after the number of sailors plummeted, in part due to the military’s strict COVID-19 vaccination mandate. 

[According to internal USCG documents](https://www.yahoo.com/video/coast-guard-offering-unheard-50k-182125913.html) obtained by Fox News Digital from October detailing fiscal year 2023 workforce planning, “Culinary Specialist,” or “CS,” level recruits could receive bonuses up to $50,000 each.

The US Navy is also offering signing bonuses up to $50,000 under certain conditions. To qualify, [Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/08/12/navys-offering-115000-join-or-come-back.html) reports that the maximum signing bonus requires enlisting in specific jobs and agreeing to ship out to boot camp quickly. The biggest bonuses are still for sailors who are eligible and interested in becoming part of the Navy’s nuclear power program — $38,000 just for the job. On top of that, you can layer more money to ship out quickly. 

In addition to the signing bonus, the Navy offers the possibility of earning up to $65,000 in loan repayments as well. Rear Adm. Lex Walker, head of Navy Recruiting Command, emphasizes that the two numbers are “not mutually exclusive, so if a Future Sailor maximizes both, that adds up to a life-altering $115,000, and the opportunity to serve in the world’s finest Navy.”

The Navy has also raised its [maximum enlistment age to 41](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2022/11/07/facing-dire-recruiting-realities-navy-raises-max-enlistment-age-to-41/) for sailors joining the fleet.  Before the policy change, the age cutoff for enlisted sailors was 39, with recruits needing to report to boot camp by their 40th birthday.

“As we continue to navigate a challenging recruiting environment, raising the enlistment age allows us to widen the pool of potential recruits, creating opportunities for personnel who wish to serve,” Navy Recruiting Command spokesman Cmdr. Dave Benham said.

The Coast Guard has also raised its [maximum enlistment age to 42](https://www.mycg.uscg.mil/News/Article/3208270/coast-guard-removes-barriers-to-boost-recruiting/) for most sailors, and to 36 for aviators. 

The Navy barely made its recruiting goal for active-duty enlisted in Fiscal Year 2022, which ended Sept. 30, bringing in 33,442 sailors — just 42 bodies more than the service’s goal.

The Navy fell about 200 active-duty officers short of its FY22 recruiting efforts, and the reserves also saw shortfalls.
