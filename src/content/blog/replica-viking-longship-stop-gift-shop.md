![vikingship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/vikingship.jpg)Looking for the perfect holiday gift?  How about an authentic replica Viking longship?  A great way to impress the relatives or perhaps get together with 60 close friends to raid a neighboring village.  You either can hire a team of researchers and book time in a specialist boat yard or you can stop by the gift shop in the [Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark](http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/) and place your order.

As reported by [The Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2648529/Is-ultimate-museum-souvenir-Danish-gift-shop-sells-325-000-replica-Viking-SHIP-sailed-1-000-years-ago.html): *The Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark, is now offering a number of Viking ships for sale, ranging from a ‘modest’ €33,000 (£27,000 and $72,000) to a slightly more expensive €400,000 (£325,000 and $545,000). The longboats are each individually crafted and allow you to experience the sea like the Norse warriors of old. The ships are meticulously built to mimic those used by the Vikings who inhabited Scandinavia from about 700 to 1100 AD.*
