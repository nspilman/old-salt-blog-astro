A belated happy birthday to Canadian singer/songwriter [Gordon Lightfoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Lightfoot), who turned 84 the day before yesterday. Often referred to as Canada’s greatest songwriter, Lightfoot is also a sailor, having owned and sailed the 39′ *Sundown* and the 45′ [*Golden Goose*](https://www.lightfoot.ca/goldgoos.htm). More than a few of Lightfoot’s songs are about sailing, ships, and the sea. One of his best-known is the [Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wreck_of_the_Edmund_Fitzgerald) about the sinking of the US flag bulk carrier of the same name in November 1975.

In honor of Lightfoot’s recent birthday, here is a lesser-known song of his about another maritime disaster. He wrote and recorded the Ballad of Yarmouth Castle in 1969. The ballad tells the story of the cruise ship [SS *Yarmouth Castle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Yarmouth_Castle) which sank after catching fire in 1965 on a voyage between Miami and Nassau, with the loss of 90 crew and passengers.
