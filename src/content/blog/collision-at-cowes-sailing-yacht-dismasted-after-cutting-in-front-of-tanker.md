Under the [Rules of the Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Regulations_for_Preventing_Collisions_at_Sea), sailing vessels generally have the right of way over motor vessels, unless the motor vessel is limited by an ability to maneuver.  Specifically, “*small vessels or sailing vessels must not impede (larger) vessels which can navigate only within a narrow channel*.”  This weekend at the races at Cowes there was a demonstration of what happens when these rules are ignored, when the yacht *‘Atlanta of Chester’* appears to have attempted to cut across the path of the UK-flag 174,000 dwt 260-metre Suezmax shuttle tanker **Hanne Knutsen**.  Fortunately no one was seriously injured.
