![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/clamagore.jpg)In March, [we posted](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/03/update-submarine-uss-clamagore-to-be-scrapped/) that the [Patriots Point Naval & Maritime Museum](https://www.patriotspoint.org/) in South Carolina had decided after years of debate to scrap [USS *Clamagore*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Clamagore_\(SS-343\)), a Cold War-era submarine that proved too costly to maintain. This week, the Balao-class submarine was towed away from Patriots Point bound for Norfolk, Va. where it will be recycled.

“It’s a sad day. But, the actual *Clamagore* lived on for 41 more years than it would have when it was de-commissioned,” said Mike Hastings, Director of Operations Patriots Point Development Authority.

Patriots Point said they had no choice but to recycle the ship. A leak last year led to a lot of problems on the submarine.

“It just comes down to the fact we didn’t have the financial ability to save her; we just didn’t. It’s a 10 million dollar minimum price,” said Hastings to [ABCNews4.com](https://abcnews4.com/news/local/clamagore-submarine-leaves-patriots-point-to-be-recycled).

The 1945-built submarine had been an exhibit at the museum in Charleston, SC since 1981.
