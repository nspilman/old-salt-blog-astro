![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/explodingwhale.jpg)Fifty years ago this November,  the residents of Florence, Oregon [learned how not to dispose of a dead whale](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/how-not-to-dispose-of-a-dead-whale/) We recently [posted about the burial of a dead humpback whale](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2023/01/humpback-whale-burial-draws-crowd-to-atlantic-city-beach/) on the beach in Atlantic City. This was the correct way to dispose of a dead whale’s carcass.

Fifty-three years ago, in Florence, OR, local officials attempted to dispose of a beached whale carcass the wrong way.  Rather than cut up and bury the carcass, [they decided to use dynamite to blow it up](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/06/approaching-the-50th-anniversay-of-the-exploding-whale-exploding-whale-park/). While, no doubt, it must have seemed like a good idea at the time, it wasn’t. The explosives blasted large chunks of decayed whale skyward, raining down on curious bystanders, and even crushing a nearby parked car.  The moment was caught on video and has since been memorialized on YouTube (see below.) 

“The blast blasted blubber beyond all believable bounds,” Paul Linnman, a journalist for the television station KATU.

In 2020, the city of Florence dedicated a park at the site of the explosion, asking residents to suggest a name for the new park. More than half of the final tally — 439 out of 856 responses — voted for “[Exploding Whale Memorial Park](https://visittheoregoncoast.com/cities/exploding-whale-memorial-park/).”
