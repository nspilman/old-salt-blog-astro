One Marine died and two were critically injured on Thursday off the coast of California when an [amphibious assault vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_Amphibious_Vehicle) (AAV) from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit took on water and sank rapidly. Seven Marines and one Navy sailor are missing and feared dead. 

[Marine Corps Times](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2020/07/31/what-we-know-about-thursdays-aav-accident/) reports that the AAV was returning to the [amphibious transport dock USS *Somerset*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Somerset_\(LPD-25\)) after conducting a training raid at San Clemente Island, California. The vehicle had 15 Marines and one sailor aboard at the time, according to the document and later confirmed by the Marine Corps.

“26 tons sinks really fast,” Jacob Aronen, who previously served as a corporal with the 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, told Marine Corps Times Friday.

Aronen said the main way to escape a sinking AAV is through the top hatches, “which often have handles that are so stiff you need to beat them with a hammer to open.”

He added the weight of the hatches often requires two Marines to push open and would get even heavier as the vehicle goes underwater.

If the Marines are unable to get the hatches open before the vehicle sinks under more than three feet of water, opening them would become “extremely difficult if not impossible,” said Tagen Schmidt, a veteran AAV crewman.
