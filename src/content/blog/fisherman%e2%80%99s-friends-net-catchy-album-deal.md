![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/03/fishermans.jpg)Last July, we [posted a video](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/07/24/were-bound-for-south-australia/) of the [Fisherman’s Friends](http://www.fishermansfriendsportisaac.co.uk/) singing the chantey ‘South Australia.’   The group is made up of ten crab and lobster fishermen and their friends who live within half a nautical mile of each other in fishing village of Port Isaac in Cornwall.   They have recently  signed an album deal – said to be worth £1m – with Universal Music.   Universal Music also represents [Lady Gaga](http://www.ladygaga.com/telephone/) and [Amy Winehouse](http://www.amywinehouse.com/).  I wonder if there is any cross marketing potential. Perhaps Amy and Lady G could perform with Fisherman’s Friends?   Several chanties come immediately to mind.  *Spanish Ladies*, *Liverpool Judies* and perhaps *Whiskey in the Jar* might be good fits.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for passing the article along.
