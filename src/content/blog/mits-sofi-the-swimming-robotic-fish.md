![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sofi.jpg)Researchers at MIT’s  [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) have developed a [swimming robotic fish](http://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/3/16/eaar3449.full?ijkey=ThPQIrxtGmySQ&keytype=ref&siteid=robotics) with a soft silicone skin, which they have dubbed SoFi, for “soft fish.” SoFi is controlled by a modified video game controllers sending ultrasonic signals to the robotic fish, swishing its tail as it swims alongside real fish.

From [MIT News](http://news.mit.edu/2018/soft-robotic-fish-swims-alongside-real-ones-coral-reefs-0321): *During test dives in the Rainbow Reef in Fiji, SoFi swam at depths of more than 50 feet for up to 40 minutes at once, nimbly handling currents and taking high-resolution photos and videos using (what else?) a fisheye lens.*

*Using its undulating tail and a unique ability to control its own buoyancy, SoFi can swim in a straight line, turn, or dive up or down. The team also used a waterproofed Super Nintendo controller and developed a custom acoustic communications system that enabled them to change SoFi’s speed and have it make specific moves and turns.*

*“To our knowledge, this is the first robotic fish that can swim untethered in three dimensions for extended periods of time,” says CSAIL PhD candidate Robert Katzschmann, lead author of the new journal article published today in Science Robotics. “We are excited about the possibility of being able to use a system like this to get closer to marine life than humans can get on their own.”*
