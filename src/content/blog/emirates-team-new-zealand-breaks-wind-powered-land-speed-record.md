![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/landspeedrecord.jpg)[Emirates Team New Zealand](https://emirates-team-new-zealand.americascup.com/en/home.html), famous for winning the America’s Cup, has [broken the wind-powered land speed record](https://emirates-team-new-zealand.americascup.com/en/news/627_222-4KM-H-WIND-POWERED-WORLD-LAND-SPEED-RECORD-BROKEN-.html). Its land yacht *Horonuku* reached [138.2 miles per hour (222.4 km/h)](https://www.fisly.org/newsletter/20221212_Landsailing_Record.pdf) in 25.3 mph winds on the dry basin of Lake Gairdner in South Australia. The previous record had been 126 mph, set in 2009 by Briton Richard Jenkins.

Glenn Ashby, pilot of the *Horonuku* was clearly happy with the run, but also tempered with the knowledge that the craft can go much faster. “The team and I are obviously buzzing to have sailed *Horonuku* at a speed faster than anyone has ever before – powered only by the wind. But in saying that we know *Horonuku* has a lot more speed in it when we get more wind and better conditions.” Said Ashby.

“So for sure there is a cause for a celebration, but this isn’t the end. From initial idea and the beginning of this world record attempt, which was pushed and supported by Grant Dalton, Matteo de Nora and the rest of the team at Emirates Team New Zealand, the objective has never been about just beating the record, it has always been about pushing things to the limit and going as fast as we possibly can. We know we can go faster, so we plan to.”

“The Land speed project has been a new opportunity to push the boundaries in aerodynamics, structural forces, construction methods and materials fields.” said Emirates Team New Zealand Principal Matteo de Nora.

“What is often underestimated is that the technologies we explore in challenges like this- or in an America’s Cup campaign – are ultimately the foundation of tomorrow’s technology. Being ahead of the times in technology is what fascinates about all the challenges faced by the team so far.”
