![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/magneticnorth.jpg)In June of last year, we posted about the [Quest for the South Magnetic Pole](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/30/quest-for-the-south-magnetic-pole/).  Recently the [Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/adjust-your-compass-now-the-north-pole-is-migrating-to-russia-2233610.html) featured an article describing how the magnetic north pole is  moving faster than at any time in human history, apparently shifting from Canada to Russia.

*Already the phenomenon is causing problems in the field of aviation. Tampa International airport in Florida has just spent a month renaming its three runways, which in common with those at most US airports are identified using numbers that correspond to the direction, in degrees, that they face on a compass. “Everything had to be changed; it was a huge project,” Brenda Geoghagan, a spokeswoman for the airport, said.*

*The current rate of magnetic north’s movement away from Canada’s Ellesmere Island is throwing out compasses by roughly one degree every five years, prompting the US Federal Aviation Administration to re-evaluate runway names across the country every five years. Similar changes were recently made to runways at Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach.*

*Geologists believe that magnetic north pole (which is different from the true North Pole, the axis on which the Earth spins) moves around due to changes in the planet’s molten core, which contains liquid iron. They first located it in 1831, and have been attrying to follow its progress ever since.*

*Records indicate that the pole’s location barely moved in the early decades, but in about 1904, it began tracking north-east at a rate of about nine miles a year. That speed increased significantly from about 1989, possibly because of a “plume” of magnetism deep below ground. The pole is now believed to be heading towards Siberia at about 37 miles each year. “Earth’s magnetic field is changing in time. And as far as we know, it has always been changing in time,” geophysicist Jeffrey Love of the US Geological Survey in Colorado told Discovery News, which investigated the issue last week.*
