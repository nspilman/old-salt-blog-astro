![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/12/ecolution-1.jpg)***CORRECTION:*** The [early news reports](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&tl=en&u=http://nieuws.nl.msn.com/algemeen/article.aspx%3Fcp-documentid%3D155410019%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter%26utm_source%3Dtwitterfeed) translated roughly from Dutch to English reported that the sailing vessel *Ecolution* was “sunk by demolitions.”  We interpreted that to mean explosives.  It appears however that no structural damage was done to the hull itself and that the vessel has been pumped out and is afloat, which would suggest that we were wrong in our interpretation of the phrase “sunk by demolitions.”   The error was entirely ours.  Thanks to Martin Römer of the *[Tres Hombres Packet Company](http://svtreshombres.homestead.com/Index.html)* for alerting us to the  mistake.

Last night, the sailing yacht *[Ecolution](http://www.ecolutions.nl/index_eng.php)* sank at the [No Limits Shipyard](http://www.nolimitships.nl/professional/) in Groningen by parties unknown.  *Ecolution* is an innovative sailing yacht owned by [Dr. Wubbo Ockels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wubbo_Ockels), Dutch physicist and former ESA astronaut.    A reward is being offered for the tip that leads to the arrest of the perpetrator or perpetrators.

*Ecolution* is a 25 meter steel schooner designed to be “the most sustainable yacht in the world.”    The schooner is equipped with hydroelectric power generation and carbon fiber masts.
