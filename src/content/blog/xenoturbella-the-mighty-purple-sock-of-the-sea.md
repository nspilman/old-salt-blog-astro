For the last sixty years or so, scientists have been puzzled how to classify the [xenoturbella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoturbella), a mysterious sea creature which resembles a purple sock. The xenoturbella has no brains, guts or even eyes. It only has a gaping mouth that allows it to take in food and release waste. [Scientists have now identified the species](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v530/n7588/full/nature16545.html), rather farther down on the “tree of life” than they had expected.
