In the 1990s, [“Theodore Tugboat”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_tugboat), was a Canadian kid’s TV show about a harbor tug in the “Big Harbor”.  In the late 90s it was picked up by US television.  Using radio controlled model tugs, it was sort of a maritime “[Thomas the Tank Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine)“.

In 2000, a 65 foot harbor tug, the [*Theodore Too*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Too), was built in Halifax.   It is a full-size replica of the scale model of the tug used in the original series.  [*Theodore Too*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Too) is currently operated as harbor tour boat – [Tour the Big Harbor](http://www.murphysonthewater.com/theodoretugboat/index.php).
