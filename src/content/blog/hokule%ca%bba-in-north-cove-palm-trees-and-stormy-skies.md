![hokstern](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hokstern.jpg)The Hawaiian voyaging canoe [*Hōkūleʻa*](http://www.hokulea.com/) was officially welcomed to New York yesterday morning in ceremonies in North Cove on the Hudson River. The voyaging canoe and her crew, in the third year of an epic voyage around the world, were greeted warmly by a large crowd under stormy skies and intermittent showers. The location was fitting as it is literally steps from the [Winter Garden Atrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Garden_Atrium), a ten story glass enclosed pavilion which is the home of sixteen 40′ tall Washingtonia robusta palm trees. If New York could not provide blue Hawaiian skies, at least we can offer palm trees.

While the long scheduled welcoming ceremony was on Sunday, *Hōkūleʻa* actually arrived in North Cove the day before to take advantage of a favorable weather window. In fact, *Hōkūleʻa* had already been in New York for the better part of a week, hanging out in Brooklyn’s Dead Horse Bay. Even on such an epic voyage, it is better to arrive a few days early to scheduled events rather than a few days late.

There are several very interesting events scheduled surrounding the *Hōkūleʻa*‘s visit in New York.  On Tuesday, June 7th at 7PM at the American Museum of Natural History in the [Hayden Planetarium Space Theater](http://www.amnh.org/our-research/hayden-planetarium), there will be a presentation of “[He Lani Ko Luna](http://www.hokulea.com/event/he-lani-ko-luna/), (A Sky Above): An Evening with the Navigators of the Hōkūleʻa Worldwide” Voyage.

On June 9th, at 7:30 the [Patagonia store in SoHo](http://www.patagonia.com/us/store/patagonia-nyc-soho-72-greene-street-new-york-city-ny-10012) will host a free presentation, “[Hōkūleʻa Storytellers Evening](http://www.hokulea.com/event/hokulea-storytellers-evening-nyc/).”

On June 11th, at the [Hawaiian Airlines Liberty Challenge at Pier 26](http://www.hokulea.com/event/hawaiian-airlines-liberty-challenge/) on the Hudson River, the Hōkūleʻa and her crew will welcome the public to tour the canoe.
