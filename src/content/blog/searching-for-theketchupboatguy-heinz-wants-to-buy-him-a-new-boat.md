![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ketchupboatguy.jpg)[Elvis Francois, 47, was repairing his boat](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/25/world/heinz-boat-elvis-francois-ketchup-trnd/index.html) on the Dutch side of the island of Saint Martin in December when his boat was carried offshore and he subsequently spent 24 days at sea. He survived off a bottle of ketchup, garlic powder, and Maggi stock cubes, which he mixed with water. Francois was rescued after a plane spotted his sailboat with “help” engraved into the hull, according to Colombian authorities.

Now, ketchup producer Heinz is trying to reach Francois with an offer to help him buy a new boat… but they can’t seem to find him. So, Heinz reached out with a virtual “message in a bottle on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CopfIRWOIrI/?hl=en):

*To whoever finds this message,*

*We need your help tracking down an amazing man with an amazing story.*

*You may remember Elvis Francois as the brave sailor who survived on nothing but ketchup and spices while adrift at sea for 24 days.*

*Well, Heinz wants to celebrate his safe return home and help him buy a new boat… but we can’t seem to find him.*

*So, we’re setting this message adrift into the sea of the internet, because if anyone can help us find him, it’s you. If you or anyone you know can help us get in contact with Elvis Francois, please drop us a DM.*

*Don’t forget to share this post with all your friends so we can #FindTheKetchupBoatGuy*

*Sincerely,*  
*Heinz*
