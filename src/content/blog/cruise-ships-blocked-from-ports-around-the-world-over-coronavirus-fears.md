![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/admunsen.jpg)More that one hundred Australian doctors and dentists on a medical conference cruise have found themselves stranded onboard the cruise ship [*Roald Amundsen*](https://www.hurtigruten.com/our-ships/green-pioneer/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwjcfzBRCHARIsAO-1_OpLY0HBopBTM-LD8JNU4_ONgY9yCrSGR9sfMhY4NFf_EzkJVadDUzsaApK4EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds#/) off Punta Arenas, Chile after the country after the country banned cruise ships from docking in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Chile announced the ban on Sunday following an elderly passenger on one cruise ship testing positive for the coronavirus.

[Guardian Australian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-covid-19-australian-doctors-dentists-stuck-cruise-ship-coast-chile) has confirmed the doctors, dentists and medical experts from Australia were on board for a 10-night cruise to Antarctica, the Falkland Islands and the Chilean Fjords as part of a combined medical and dental conference put on by Unconventional Conventions.

[*Celebrity Eclipse*](https://www.celebritycruises.com/cruise-ships/celebrity-eclipse), with a capacity of close to 3,000, has also been refused docking in Chile. Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, said the vessel would refuel and load supplies in Valparaiso, Chile, and then sail to San Diego. 

Holland America Line’s ship [*Zaandam*](https://www.hollandamerica.com/en_US/cruise-ships/ms-zaandam/3.html), Silversea’s [*Silver Explorer* and](https://www.silversea.com/ships.html) *Silver Shadow,* and Royal Caribbean-owned ship, the [*Azamara Pursuit*](https://www.azamara.com/our-ships/azamara-pursuit) are also currently blocked from entering Chilean ports.

[Chile is not the only country blocking cruise ship entry](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/03/17/cruise-ships-around-world-are-scrambling-find-open-ports-passengers-stuck-coronavirus-shutdown/). The *Norwegian Dream* has been denied docking and disembarking in Fiji after reportedly also being turned away from other South Pacific ports. 

The Fred Olsen Lines ship [*Braemar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Braemar), was finally allowed to dock and disembark passengers in Cuba after being turned away from Barbados and ports in the Bahamas. Five people on board the *Braemar* tested positive for the coronavirus.

In the Mediterranean, [*Costa Luminosa*](https://www.costacruises.com/fleet/luminosa/v1.html) diverted to Marseille, France after passengers were not allowed off in Tenerife. Three passengers on a previous cruise tested positive for the coronavirus and three current passengers exhibited symptoms but are awaiting test results.
