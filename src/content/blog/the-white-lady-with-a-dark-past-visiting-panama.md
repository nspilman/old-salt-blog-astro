One of the most beautiful tall ships on the water, the Chilean Navy’s *[Esmeralda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmeralda_\(BE-43\))*, will be [docked in Balboa, Panama through tomorrow](http://www.newsroompanama.com/featured-events/1441-the-white-lady-visits-panama.html). Esmeralda, a steel-hulled four-masted barquentine, is nicknamed the “White Lady.”   She is the sister ship to the four-masted topsail schooner *[Juan Sebastián Elcano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_ship_Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Elcano_\(1927\))*, a training ship for the Spanish Navy.  
  
The White Lady has a dark past.  According to Amnesty International, the US Senate and Chilean Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the ship was used from 1973 to 1980 by the Chilean regime of Augusto Pinochet as a floating prison where political prisoners were tortured in some cases to death.  In December of 2009, the Chilean Navy temporarily suspended the Esmerald’d sailing schedule after after [12 men, including four retired senior navy officers, were arrested on charges of torture and kidnapping charges](http://santiagotimes.cl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=17781:chiles-navy-suspends-esmeralda-departure-following-arrest-of-four-retired-officials-&catid=19:other&Itemid=142) that allegedly occurred aboard the ship.
