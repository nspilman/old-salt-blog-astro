[Drivers on Interstate 95 in Connecticut](http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20150916/NEWS/150919458) may have been surprised recently to see the [78-foot, wooden yacht *Doris*](http://doris1905.com/) traveling by trailer down the highway, on her way to restoration and a new life. The 1905 built sloop is believed to be the largest surviving wooden yacht from the famous Herreshoff Manufacturing Company of Bristol, Rhode Island.  *Doris* has been stored at Crocker’s Boat Yard in New London for the past 30 years or so, was moved to the Taylor & Snediker Yacht Restoration company of Pawcatuck. The yacht was scheduled to be scrapped at the end of August 2013, but a new, currently anonymous, owner was found. [New England Boating](http://newenglandboating.com/news/stonington-yard-to-restore-78-wooden-herreshoff.html) reports that “*Taylor & Snediker may employ up to 9 workers to work full time for the next 5 years on Doris. When the work is completed, most of the original frames, planking and other components will have been replaced.*”

[*Doris,* ex*\-Astarte,* ex-*Huntress* and ex-*Vayu*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_\(sailing_yacht\)) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. She was designed by [Nathaniel Greene Herreshoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathanael_Greene_Herreshoff), who designed five America’s Cup defender yachts and who also was the main architect of the America’s Cup rule change called the [Universal Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Rule). That rule allowed for displacement as well as length and sail area to be included in a formula defining yacht eligibility, and enabled more “sea-kindly” and roomier yachts to be competitive. *Doris* is said to be the first boat built under the universal rule.
