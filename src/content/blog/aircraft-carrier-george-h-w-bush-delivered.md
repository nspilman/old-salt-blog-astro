![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/CVN-77.jpg)After being under construction for almost a decade, the aircraft carrier *George H. W. Bush* was accepted by the US Navy following final seatrials last Friday.

*As the Navy officially took ownership of the ship, it acquired the most technologically advanced and capable aircraft carrier in the world.*

*But the Bush wasn’t without its problems. The ship was delivered about a year late because of labor shortages in the Newport News yard and a host of construction deficiencies that the Navy required to be repaired before it would accept delivery.*

*The carrier also was part of [a sweeping Northrop-Navy probe](http://www.dailypress.com/business/dp-local_welds_0530may30,0,7798853.story) into faulty welding practices in Newport News, though no major problems have been identified on the Bush.*

*The Bush’s delivery marks the end of a long, storied chapter in Navy shipbuilding and for the Newport News shipyard. It is the 10th and final ship of the Nimitz class — all of which were built in Newport News — and all of which are still active in the fleet.*
