![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/providencesail1.jpg)I had kind of lost track of the replica Revolutionary War sloop *Providence*. In January 2015, [she was blown off her jackstands](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/01/tall-ship-providence-blown-over-in-blizzard-winds/) by blizzard winds while on the hard in Newport, RI, incurring significant damage to her hull and rigging. In August 2016, there were [reports that repairs were underway](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/08/update-replica-continental-sloop-providence-repaired/).  There are now reports that the [*Providence* may be moving to Alexandria, VA](http://alextimes.com/2017/09/waterfrontcommission/). Toward the end of September, Scott Shaw, principal of Alexandria Restaurant Partners, presented a plan to permanently dock the *Providence* at Waterfront Park in Alexandria.  

The sloop *Providence* is a 1976 built fiberglass replica of a Continental Navy sloop of the same name.  Originally built as the merchant sloop [*Katy* in 1768 by the Brown family](http://www.gaspee.info/history/shipsdescribed/ProvidenceOtherShips.htm) of Providence RI, the sloop was outfitted with guns in 1774 to cruise against the British in Narraganset Bay.

Under the command of [Abraham Whipple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Whipple), the *Katy* destroyed the armed sloop *Diana,* a tender to HMS *ROSE.*  Captain Whipple had been one of the leaders of a raid which burned HMS Gaspee. Whipple was never charged but his role was not a well-kept secret. Captain Wallace of the *ROSE* sent Captain Whipple a message: “*You Abraham Whipple on June 10, 1772, burned his majesty’s vessel the Gaspee and I will hang you at the yard-arm!*” Whipple replied to Wallace: “*Sir, alw**ays catch a man before you hang him*.” 

Not long thereafter the *Katy* was chartered to the Rhode Island Assembly and then sold into the Continental Navy. Renamed USS *Providence,* the sloop was [John Paul Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Jones)‘ first command.  

I have a particular fondness for Abraham Whipple. He makes an appearance in my latest novel, [*Evening Gray Morning Red*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075NY1SRL/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1505735970&sr=1-1&keywords=spilman+evening+gray), which will be out in a few days.
