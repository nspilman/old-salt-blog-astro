![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/05/zebu.jpg)This has been a terrible few days for the [historic tall ship *Zebu*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebu_\(ship\)).  On Thursday, the 100′ long brigantine, built in Sweden in 1938, encountered unspecified difficulties and had to be [towed out of shipping lanes](https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/historic-flagship-liverpool-tall-ship-20586016) off Wales by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). The ship was towed to an anchorage at [Holyhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holyhead).

On Saturday, the ship broke from its moorings and drifted onto the Holyhead New Harbour breakwater, where she became hard aground. A rescue mission was launched by HM Coastguards’ Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre – but was ultimately unsuccessful. The [ship heeled over as the tide fell](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/historic-albert-dock-ship-found-20610483), rolling more than 45 degrees and subsequently flooding.

*Zebu* had been heading to Bristol for conservation work from her base at the Royal Albert Dock in Liverpool.

*Zebu* is a registered historic traditional brigantine rigged tall ship and was declared the [National Historic Ships](https://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/page/shipshape/tall-ship-zebu-liverpool) regional flagship of the year for the north-west in 2020.
