![miamijettyboat](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/09/miamijettyboat.jpg)On Sunday morning, some time around 3AM, a 32′ powerboat slammed into the rocks at high speed at the Governor’s Cut jetty off South Beach, Miami, FL. The three men aboard, including Miami Marlins ace pitcher [Jose Fernandez](http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/25/us/mlb-pitcher-jose-fernandez-dead/), 24, were all killed. Fernandez was considered to be a rising star in Major League baseball.

What happened? The accident investigation is only beginning but several factors appear to have contributed to the tragedy. Based on photographs, the boat struck the jetty at full speed. The accident happened at night. Although the channel was well marked by lighted buoys, the rock jetty was unlit. The night was clear and the waves were not high.

The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/26/sports/baseball/jose-fernandez-dead-miami-marlins.html?_r=0) quotes Officer Lorenzo Veloz, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission who said that “the boat is in very bad shape. It does appear that the vessel went straight into the rocks.” He discounted weather as a factor but suggested that darkness may have played a role. “It’s totally different than driving by day,” he said. “You don’t have streetlights out on the ocean. There is no real view of the surrounding areas.”

Jose Fernandez did not own the SeaVee powerboat involved in the accident, nor was he believed to have been at the helm. Toxicology tests will be performed to determine if alcohol played a role in the accident. None of the men were wearing PFDs.

While this accident makes the news because of the death of a well known athlete, sadly, it is not that unusual. According the [USCG Recreational Boating Accident Statistics for 2015,](https://www.uscgboating.org/library/accident-statistics/Recreational-Boating-Statistics-2015.pdf) the top three known contributing factors to boating accidents are operator inattention, operator inexperience, and improper lookout. Ranking fifth on the list, ahead of alcohol use, is excessive speed.
