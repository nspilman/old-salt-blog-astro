The [Howard Steamboat Museum](https://www.howardsteamboatmuseum.org/) recently posted a video “A River, a Family, and a Shipyard: The History of the Howard Family of Steamboat Builders” that tells the story of [James Howard and the Howard Family](https://www.rivermuseum.com/national-rivers-hall-of-fame-inductees/inductees/james-howard), who were the most successful steamboat builders in American history.  James Howard established his boatyard in Jeffersonville, Indiana in 1834. By 1890, half of the steamboats on the western rivers were built by the Howards.
