Today we spotlight [*Lone Escort*](https://www.amazon.com/Lone-Escort-Fighting-Sail-Book-ebook/dp/B08HJLB5XK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2XE7PJBX6E9UI&dchild=1&keywords=alaric+bond&qid=1601316572&s=digital-text&sprefix=alaric+%2Cdigital-text%2C150&sr=1-1) by [Alaric Bond](https://www.alaricbond.com/), the thirteenth book of his “Fighting Sail” series.  About the book:

The North Atlantic in spring is a perilous place and, with a valuable convoy to protect, HMS *Tenacious* has a tough job ahead. But she is fresh from refit, fully manned and seemingly up to the task; the only factor likely to invite defeat is her captain.

With breathtaking naval action, strong personal dynamics, and a mass of historical detail, *Lone Escort* is a nautical thriller of the first order.

*Bond consistently delivers rousing naval adventures, vividly seen through the eyes of the seamen as well as those in command on the quarterdeck. A superb storyteller, he weaves suspenseful scenarios, which move like smoke and oakum from one plight to the next.* Quarterdeck Magazine.
