[The Fate of HMS Beagle After Darwin´s Voyage to the Galapagos Islands](http://irhal.com/Irhal-Travel-News/General-Travel-News/The-Fate-of-HMS-Beagle-After-Darwins-Voyage-to-the-Galapagos-Islands.html)

*HMS Beagle was the ship that sailed around the world with the young naturalist by the name of Charles Darwin onboard. The ship was sold for scrap in 1870 but until now it´s final fate has remained one of the world´s great naval mysteries.*  
  
*A discovery has been made by Robert Prescott of St Andrews University, who is one of the world´s leading marine archaeologists. He says that he is quietly confident that the final resting place is near Potton Island in Essex, UK. Geophysical techniques and an advanced ground-penetrating radar located a buried structure which matches the size and shape of the Beagle.*

*Techniques used to see if the timbers are from the Beagle include testing the ship´s bilges for remains of tiny marine organisms called diatoms. Certain species of diatom are found in specific areas of the world so they are hoping to find diatoms unique to the Pacific or Australian waters. So far the results have been very positive but for incontrovertible proof one well recognized tropical diatom must be found.*

*After the Beagle returned from its infamous journey it was used as an anti-smuggling patrol vessel along the Essex Coast. Further investigation by Prescott uncovered that the Beagle was moored mid-stream on the River Roach where it could intercept smugglers. It was not a popular permanent fixture as it was claimed it harmed the oyster beds. Final records from 1870 show that it was auctioned for £525 to local scrap merchants, Murray and Trainer.*

*Prescott says that the discovery is of great importance. “Most of the upper part of the ship may have gone, but we have the lower parts and hull, and who knows what remnants of Darwin´s trip may still lie down there”. We shall have to wait and see.*
