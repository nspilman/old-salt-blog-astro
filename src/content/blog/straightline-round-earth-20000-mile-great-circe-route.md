![rQlk4](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rQlk4.jpg)How far can you sail in a straight line without hitting land?  The answer appears to be an almost 20,000 mile voyage from Pakistan to the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia.  The red line on the map, above, shows the voyage. 

OK, so the red line looks anything but straight. Nevertheless, it is a straight line as projected on a flat map.  The earth is anything but flat. Check out the video below to see the line projected on a spherical earth.  What we are seeing is a great circle route between Pakistan to the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, which happens to stay clear of land.  A [great circle](http://geography.about.com/od/understandmaps/a/greatcircle.htm) is an arc representing the shortest distance between two points anywhere on the Earth’s surface. Thanks to Patrick Anderson for uploading the video.
