I am not one for cute pet videos.  And I am not a huge fan of cats. Nevertheless, for this video I have to make an exception.  The video was shot in at the [Theater of the Sea](http://www.theaterofthesea.com/), a marine animal park in Islamorada, Florida in 1997. The dolphins are Shiloh and Thunder and the cat is Arthur.  Thanks to Ann and Hal Brown for passing the video along.
