![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/07/combiliftiiipekingcrop.jpg)The ship was just a silhouette in the haze as we sailed into New York harbor. We were on the last leg of the delivery of my new/old sailboat *Arcturus* from southern Virginia to Oyster Bay, Long Island.  The ship in the distance looked odd. The ship’s deck-house was forward with three pedestal cranes aft.  What was strange was the other rigging, which at first looked like four king posts, rising from the deck.  Why would a ship with pedestal cranes also have king posts?

I then realized what I was seeing. The ship was the heavy-lift [*Combi Dock III*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/305351000) and what looked like king posts were the masts of the windjammer [*Peking*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_\(ship\)) sitting in the well deck, leaving New York for the last time, on her way to restoration and a new life in Hamburg.  See our [previous post of the Peking being floated aboard the *Combi Dock III*.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/07/windjammer-peking-loaded-combi-dock-ii-voyage-home/#more-47090) 

For more (and better) photos of the *Peking’*s departure on *Combi Dock III* go to Will Van Dorp’s [*Tugster blog*](https://tugster.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/combi-dock-iii-and-the-peking-saga-5/).

As we noted in a [previous post,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/07/windjammer-peking-loaded-combi-dock-ii-voyage-home/#more-47090) *Peking* was built in 1911 at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg for the German ship owner, F. Laeisz, one of the famous [Flying P Liners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner), which were among the last of the great sailing ships to round Cape Horn carrying cargo. *Peking* made voyages from Europe to the west coast of South America with general cargo and returned filled with nitrates for use in the making of fertilizer and explosives. The windjammer was made famous by the Irving Johnson film *Around Cape Horn* which documented her 1929 passage around the southern tip of South America in hurricane conditions. After 1933, the *Peking* served as the school ship, *Arethusa II*, mooring on the River Medway in Great Britain.  She was purchased as museum ship by the South Street Seaport Museum in 1975. After being restored, the *Peking* will serve as a museum ship at a maritime museum in Hamburg.
