![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/img_korea_his_54.jpg)On August 15th, 1653, the [Dutch East India Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company) ship, *[Sperwer](http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C14/E1405.htm)* (Sparrow Hawk), was shipwrecked on Jeju Island off the southern coast of Korea.  Thirty six of the sixty four crew survived. One of the survivors was the ship’s book keeper, [Hendrick Hamel.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Hamel)  The surviving crew was brought to Seoul and presented to the court of the king, Hyojong of Joseon. The [Joseon dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon_Dynasty) was often referred to as the “Hermit Kingdom” for its harsh isolationism and closed borders. The shipwrecked Dutchmen were given some freedom of movement, but were forbidden to leave the country.  After thirteen years in Korea, Hamel and seven others escaped to Japan. They were finally able to reach the Netherlands in 1666. On his return, Hamel published an account of his time in Korea, the first European account of Korea and the Joseon dynasty.

Coincidentally, in addition to the wreck of the *Sperwer*, [August 15th is an important date in Korean history.](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2011/08/123_92660.html)   On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered, ending World War II in the Pacific.   Also on August 15th, 1948, the Republic of South Korea was established.
