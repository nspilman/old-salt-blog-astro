![molasses](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/molasses.jpg)What is worse than an oil spill?  A molasses spill, apparently.  There are ways to clean up after an oil spill, whereas no one knows how clean up spilled molasses.  Earlier this month, a [Matson pipeline spilled 1,400 tons (233,000 gallons) of molasses into Honolulu harbor](http://health.hawaii.gov/news/files/2013/05/13-050-Molasses-Spill-in-Honolulu-Harbor-Causes-Fish-Kill.pdf), resulting in a brown plume which so far has killed 26,000 fish.  The molasses is also believed to be [killing shoreline coral reefs](http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/23430301/experts-matson-molasses-spill-caused-significant-coral-reef-damage). The brown ooze has displaced oxygen in the water which fish, crustaceans and coral need to survive.  There is currently no known way to clean up the molasses which has settled to the bottom. It is believed that overtime bacteria will consume the molasses though there are concerns that a bacteria bloom could cause another fish kill. The [EPA announced this week](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/epa-will-probe-233-000-gallon-molasses-spill-in-hawaiian-harbor) that they would be launching an investigation into the spill.

[Matson](http://www.matson.com/) is the only shipper of bulk molasses from the Hawaiian islands. There are currently no government regulations in place related to molasses since it was not considered a hazardous material, like gasoline and oil.  More than a year ago, in July 2012, Matson was notified in writing by the Hawaii Department of Transportation that [a state inspector saw molasses leaking](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/20/hawaii-molasses-spill-pip_n_3965031.html) from the same spot as the recent spill. Matson inspected the pipeline but said that they could not find a leak.  [Matson has taken responsibility for the leak and has agree to cover the costs](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-ZJRXJ/2690739154x0x691031/1e1aa84e-933f-40b2-9986-0cb2e196122c/MATX_News_2013_9_16_General_Releases.pdf) of the spill response.  [
