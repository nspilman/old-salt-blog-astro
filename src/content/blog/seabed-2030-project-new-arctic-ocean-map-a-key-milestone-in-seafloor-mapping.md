![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/seabed2030.jpg)It is often said that we know more about the [surface of the moon than we do about the ocean floor](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/04/19/you-asked-moon-oceans/#:~:text=The%20main%20reason%20for%20our,by%20light%20and%20radio%20waves.). The [Seabed 2030 Project](https://seabed2030.org/) aims to help rectify this lack of knowledge by mapping the world’s ocean floor by 2030. 

[Seabed 2030  recently announced](https://seabed2030.org/2025/02/03/new-arctic-ocean-map-marks-key-milestone-in-global-seafloor-mapping/) the publication of the latest version of the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO), Version 5.0. This release adds 1.4 million square kilometers of mapping coverage – an area over three times the size of Sweden – to the global seafloor dataset. Seabed 2030 is a collaborative project between the [Nippon Foundation](https://en.nippon-foundation.or.jp/) and [GEBCO.](https://www.gebco.net/) 

The release also highlights the challenges and innovations associated with mapping the Arctic Ocean, where perennial sea-ice cover and extreme conditions have traditionally limited data collection. Overcoming these obstacles has required groundbreaking technology and international collaboration.

Commenting on the release, Martin Jakobsson, Co-Head of Seabed 2030’s Arctic and North Pacific Regional Center, said: “The release of IBCAO Version 5.0 is a testament to the collaborative effort of the Arctic research community and our dedication to overcoming the challenges posed by the extreme Arctic environment. 

“This dataset not only furthers our understanding of the Arctic seabed, but also exemplifies the power of teamwork in advancing global knowledge.”

Seabed 2030 Project Director Jamie McMichael-Phillips added: “This release underscores the importance of regional initiatives like IBCAO in helping us achieve our goal of a fully mapped ocean floor by 2030. It represents a crucial step towards making essential data accessible for sustainable ocean management.”

All data collected and shared with the Seabed 2030 project will be included in the free and publicly available GEBCO global grid.
