![hermoinebanner](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/11/hermoinebanner.jpg)Twenty years ago, a small group of enthusiasts conceived a plan to build a replica of the French frigate, [*l’Hermione*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_frigate_Hermione_\(1779\)), the ship which [carried the Marquis de Lafayette, to America in 1780](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_frigate_Hermione_\(1779\)) with the news of French support for the American revolution. The [new *l’Hermoine*](http://www.hermione2015.com/) has now successfully completed two months of sea trials and in April 2015 will sail across the Atlantic and visit 12 ports on the US East Coast and Canada.

On Saturday, I was fortunate to attend a presentation by [Miles Young,](http://www.ogilvy.com/About/Ogilvy-and-Mather-Board/Miles-Young.aspx) President of Friends of Hermione-Lafayette in America (FOH-LA) and Chairman and CEO of Ogilvy & Mather.  He described the planned voyage, as well as the education & outreach programs being developed to support the arrival of the ship. The programs are intended to highlight the too often overlooked French contribution to the American Revolution.

[From the Voyage2015 web page](http://www.hermione2015.com/new-page-1/)*: Via numerous partnerships, FOH also plans to create an educational “laboratory in the water” and extend it into classroom, museum, and digital education for inter-disciplinary learning: in History, Languages and Literature, Art, Historic Reconstruction and what American educators call STEM (“Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics”) wherein the ship itself is the object and gateway back into French-American history.*
