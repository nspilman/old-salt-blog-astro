![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/10/hmsthistle.jpg)The [Institute of Maritime Research](https://hi.no/hi) [announced recently that the wreckage](https://www.hi.no/en/hi/news/2023/october/unknown-submarine-wreck-world-war-2) of the World War II British submarine [HMS *Thistle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Thistle_\(N24\)) has probably been discovered outside Rogaland, Norway, after more than 80 years on the seabed.

In the Spring of 2023, the wreckage of an [unknown submarine](https://mareano.no/en/news/news-2023/unknown-submarine-wreck-world-war-2) was discovered during a research cruise on the RV *G.O. Sars,* conducted through the [MAREANO program](https://mareano.no/en), which maps the biology and geology of the seabed.

After some research, the submarine was determined to be British and to be either HMS *Oxley* or HMS *Thistle*. The *Oxley* was sunk just before World War II and the *Thistle* during the conflict. A subsequent research cruise in October 2023, determined that the wreckage was almost certainly that of the *Thistle*.

“In advance, we knew what characteristics we should look for; thus we were able to identify the wreck as *Thistle*, but with a small caveat that it is the Royal Navy who is responsible for the final identification”, says cruise leader Kyrre Heldal Kartveit.

In April of 1940, HMS *Thistle* was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U-4 with the loss of all 53 officers and crew.

The wreckage is now considered a “war grave,” according to the news release because it sank during wartime. The British Royal Navy maintains ownership rights over the submarine, which rests 160 meters below the surface of the ocean.
