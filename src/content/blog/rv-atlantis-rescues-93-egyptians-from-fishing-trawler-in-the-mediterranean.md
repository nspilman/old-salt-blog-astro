RV Atlantis

Last Friday night, only twelve hours into a 15 day Mediterranean voyage, the [research vessel *Atlantis*](http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8143) received a mayday call, relayed by the Greek Coast Guard reporting a fishing boat in distress about 40 miles away, near the island of Kythera. They found a fifty foot long fishing boat overloaded with 93 Egyptian men. In 30 knot winds and 6 to 8 foot seas, the crew of the Atlantis was able to rescue everyone aboard the fishing boat, and deliver them to the southern Greek port of Kalamata. The men taken off the fishing boat are believed to have been fleeing Egypt bound for Italy or Greece.
