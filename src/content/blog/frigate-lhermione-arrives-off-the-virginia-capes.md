The [French frigate *l’Hermoine*](http://www.hermione2015.com/index.html) arrived off the Virginia Capes yesterday where she was greeted by the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer [USS *Mitscher*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Mitscher_%28DDG-57%29). *l’Hermoine* is scheduled to visit Yorktown, Va. on June 5 on her twelve port East Coast tour.  The ship is a replica of the frigate *[l’Hermione](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_frigate_Hermione_%281779%29)* which carried the Marquis de Lafayette to America 1780 with the news of French support for the American revolution.

*l’Hermione* arrived on the American coast very close site of the [Battle of the Capes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Chesapeake) (also known as the Battle of the Chesapeake) of 1781 in which a French fleet commanded by [Rear Admiral François Joseph Paul,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Joseph_Paul_de_Grasse) the Comte de Grasse, defeated a Royal Navy fleet commanded by [Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Graves,_1st_Baron_Graves). The French victory at helped to ensure the victory of American and French forces in the [Seige of Yorktown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown).
