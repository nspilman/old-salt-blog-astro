It is difficult to imagine how anyone thought that this was a good idea.  The XO (Executive Officer) on the nuclear powered aircraft carrier *[USS Enterprise](http://www.enterprise.navy.mil/)* made a series of videos to “entertain the crew.”  They were a bit on the raunchy side, involving masturbation, “chicks in the shower” sailors in drag, gay slurs, rectal exams – that sort of thing.   Some people on board were offended.  Complaints were ignored.   The XO,  Owen Honors, who is now the captain of the ship, suggested that if people did not  like the videos, they shouldn’t  watch them. He also states at the beginning of each video that “the captain and the admiral – they don’t know anything at all about the content of this video or the movie this evening, and they should absolutely not be held accountable in any judicial setting.” OK, fine.   How the XO, now the captain, thought that the ***videos*** would not find their way to the world outside the ship, to say, I don’t know, the ***internet***, is frankly a bit beyond me.   Captain Honors is now in hot water for his lack of judgement and his video directing and editing skills are on display all over the web.   Here is a sample as provided in reporting by the [Virginia Pilot](http://hamptonroads.com/2010/12/raunchy-videos-starring-enterprise-skipper-come-light?cid=srch):
