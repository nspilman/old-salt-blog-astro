[![subpano1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/subpano1.jpg)](http://www.maritime.org/tour/index.php)Thanks to Richard Pekelney for passing along the [link to a wonderful panoramic and audio tour](http://www.maritime.org/tour/index.php) of the [USS](http://www.maritime.org/pamphome.htm) *[Pampanito](http://www.maritime.org/pamphome.htm),* a World War II Balao class Fleet submarine museum and memorial that is open for visitors daily at San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf.  By clicking and dragging your mouse across the images you can wander from the main deck to the forward and after torpedo rooms and everywhere in between. The 360 degree panoramic photos are extremely well done. There is text explaining what you are seeing as well as an mp3 audio tour that you can click.
