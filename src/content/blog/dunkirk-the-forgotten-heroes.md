![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/dunkirk1.jpg)A few days ago we posted about the [“Little Ships of Dunkirk” returning to Ramsgate](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/05/22/operation-dynamo-the-little-ships-return-to-ramsgate-for-70th-anniversary/) to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the evacuation.  This Friday there is what looks to be a very interesting documentary, [Dunkirk: The Forgotten Heros](http://uktv.co.uk/yesterday/item/aid/635941/displayVideo/hi),  focusing on escape of the British Expeditionary Force including the capture of 40,000 soldiers which was kept a secret by the British government for propaganda reasons.   It will be broadcast on the Yesterday channel in the UK.  With luck it may make it across the pond at some point.

*To commemorate the 70th anniversary of one of WWII’s most daring and spectacular events, Dunkirk: The Forgotten Heroes continues the year-long The Spirit Of 1940 strand of programming on Yesterday, which features new and exclusive shows, and tells the unknown story of the thousands of heroic men left behind to stop the German advance and to facilitate the famous mass evacuation across the Channel.   An incredible 100,000 soldiers were deployed during the evacuation to hold the Germans at bay and ordered to make a last stand, but fearing negative propaganda, the subsequent capture of 40,000 soldiers was kept secret.*
