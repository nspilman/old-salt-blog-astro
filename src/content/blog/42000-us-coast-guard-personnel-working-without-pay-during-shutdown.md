![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/US-CoastGuard.jpg)Approximately 42,000 active-duty military members of the Coast Guard remain on duty during the partial government shutdown that began Saturday, but they will work without pay until further notice, according to a statement from a Coast Guard spokeswoman.

“Unless legislation is passed by Friday, Dec. 28, our military workforce will not receive our regularly scheduled pay check for 31 Dec.,” Chief Warrant Officer Allyson Conroy said in a statement to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/42-000-coast-guard-members-are-only-military-branch-work-n952066) on Wednesday.

The Coast Guard is the only part of the military under the Department of Homeland Security, rather than the Department of Defense which continues to be funded during the shutdown.

[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/42-000-coast-guard-members-are-only-military-branch-work-n952066) reports that of the thousands of people in the Coast Guard’s civilian workforce, most have been furloughed without pay until further notice, with a small fraction still working as essential personnel.

Emily Garris, 42, the wife of a Coast Guard member stationed in California and mother of two, told NBC News the current shutdown has left many families feeling “cast aside.”

In previous government shutdowns when the other military branches were also affected, Garris said her husband was paid as a result of emergency funding passed by Congress.

This is the first time in her husband’s 25 years of service he has come so close to not receiving a paycheck, she said in a phone interview Wednesday.

“People who serve in the Coast Guard don’t do it for the riches. They do it because they love our country; they want to serve the country they love,” Garris said. “And for us to just be cast aside, this is hurtful. We put so much on the line every day.”
