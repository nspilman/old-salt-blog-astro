![bluenoseII](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bluenoseII.jpg)[Millions over budget and years behind schedule](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/04/bluenose-ii-no-way-to-restore-a-schooner/), the Canadian schooner *[Bluenose II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluenose_II)* finally set sail last week from Lunenberg, Nova Scotia on a training sail. *Bluenose II*  is owned by the government of Nova Scotia and will serve as a sailing ambassador for the province. While notionally a restoration and repair of the schooner *Bluenose II* built in 1963, the schooner is essentially new construction with new a keel, frames and planking and more modern scantlings. Originally budgeted at $14 million, the final cost will be over $20 million and may rise further. A $5 million claim with the shipyard has yet to be adjudicated. The new schooner is a near replica of the famous Nova Scotia fishing schooner *[Bluenose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluenose),* built in 1921, which won a series of fishing schooner races in the 1920s and 1930s.  Images of the schooner *Bluenose* have appeared on a Canadian stamp as well as on the current Nova Scotia licence plate and on the Canadian dime.
