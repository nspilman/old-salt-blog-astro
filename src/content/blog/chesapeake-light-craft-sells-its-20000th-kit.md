*Chesapeake Light Craft, the Maryland-based designers and suppliers of ply and wooden kits for home-builders, celebrated the sale of its 20,000th kit last week.*

*In CB268, we covered the story of CLC, a company founded in 1991 which has gone on to provide kits for small, lightweight canoes, sailing and rowing dinghies, to be used on the 30,000 lakes and countless rivers of the USA – and around the world. “If the boats were laid end to end,” says boss John Harris, “they’d stretch for 57 miles.”*

*CLC is one firm that seems to have been bucking the downturn in recent years, firstly because the kits are so affordable (a 15ft sailing dinghy can be had for under £1,000 complete with sail rig) and also because the light weight of the kits (they typically weigh in at under 100lbs/45kgs) means that they can be cheaply transported around the world. In Britain, CLC kits are stocked by Fyne Boat Kits.*
