After a long and varied career, the yacht was restored and  given to the [Stavanger Maritime Museum](http://www.museumstavanger.no/museums/stavanger-maritime-museum/) in Norway in 1984.  She sailed in many national and international regattas and and has won both her own class and overall in regatta legs in The Tall Ships’ Races. She participated in the Cutty Sark Tall Ships’ Race six times.
