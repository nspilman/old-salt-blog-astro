Leon of 1880 (left), Little Leon (right)

When I first saw the photo, I thought that the [*Little Leon*](http://www.aqsim.com/littleleon/) was sailed by giants. The ship looked properly to scale, while the crew seemed disproportionately large.  It turns out that *Little Leon* is a 16′ long brigantine modeled after the *Leon*, a 120′ Norwegian brigantine built in 1880.  *Little Leon* will be sailing in the [Old City Seaport Festival](http://www.phillyseaport.org/seaportfestival) on the Delaware River in Philadelphia sponsored by the [Independence Seaport Museum](http://www.phillyseaport.org/Default.aspx) from October 5-7th.  For fans of other “small ships” see our post from 2010: “[Small Ships Under the Tower Bridge](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/05/02/small-ships-under-the-tower-bridger/)“
