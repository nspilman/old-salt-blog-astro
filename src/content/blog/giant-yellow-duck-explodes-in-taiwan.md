Disturbing video of the [Giant Yellow Duck exploding shortly before a New Year’s Day celebration](http://news.yahoo.com/giant-yellow-duck-explodes-taiwan-again-104123196.html) in the northern Taiwan port city of Keeling. it is unclear what caused the duck to explode though some are speculating that it was attacked by eagles. The duck has had a difficult tine in its visit to Taiwan. While it attracted 4 million visitors in its month stay in Kaohsiung, it needed to be deflated and taken ashore when Typhoon Usagi hit the island.

We have followed the travels of Dutch artist [Florentijn Hofman](http://www.florentijnhofman.nl/dev/)‘s inflatable sculpture “Spreading Joy Around the World,” better known simply as the Giant Yellow Duck. In June, we posted about its [visit to Hong Kong](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/06/hong-kong-bids-rubber-duck-adieu-as-pittsburgh-welcomes-inflated-yellow-avian/), and in September its [arrival in Pittsburgh](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/09/guess-arrived-pittsburgh-yesterday-afternoon/).  The almost 60 foot tall inflatable sculpture inspired by a bath toy has traveled to 13 cities in nine countries on its journey around the world. Thanks to Kevin Boatman Foster for pointing out the recent explosion on Facebook.
