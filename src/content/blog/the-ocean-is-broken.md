Roughly two hundred years ago, [Lord Byron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron) published [Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage](http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19894), which contains a stanza that today seems sadly dated:

*Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean–roll!*  
*Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;*  
*Man marks the earth with ruin–his control*  
*Stops with the shore;–upon the watery plain*  

Ten years ago Australian yachtsman Ivan Macfadyen sailed from Melbourne to the West Coast of the United States by way of Osaka, Japan.  A decade later, he repeated the voyage and was stunned and saddened by the effects of over-fishing and the vast debris fields that clutter the Pacific.   “The ocean is broken,” Macfadyen concluded, in shock, sadness and outrage.

*“On the bow, in the waters above Hawaii, you could see right down into the depths. I could see that the debris isn’t just on the surface, it’s all the way down. And it’s all sizes, from a soft-drink bottle to pieces the size of a big car or truck.*

*“We saw a factory chimney sticking out of the water, with some kind of boiler thing still attached below the surface. We saw a big container-type thing, just rolling over and over on the waves.*

*“We were weaving around these pieces of debris. It was like sailing through a garbage tip.*

*“Below decks you were constantly hearing things hitting against the hull, and you were constantly afraid of hitting something really big. As it was, the hull was scratched and dented all over the place from bits and pieces we never saw.”*

*Plastic was ubiquitous. Bottles, bags and every kind of throwaway domestic item you can imagine, from broken chairs to dustpans, toys and utensils.*

*And something else. The boat’s vivid yellow paint job, never faded by sun or sea in years gone past, reacted with something in the water off Japan, losing its sheen in a strange and unprecedented way.*

*Back in Newcastle, Ivan Macfadyen is still coming to terms with the shock and horror of the voyage.*

*“The ocean is broken,” he said, shaking his head in stunned disbelief.*
