![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/puller1.jpg)The USNS [*Lewis B. Puller*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Lewis_B._Puller_\(T-ESB-3\)) has sailed from Norfolk on its maiden voyage as an expeditionary sea base supporting the U.S. Fifth Fleet.  The *Puller* is the first of two expeditionary sea bases. A sister vessel, the USNS [*Hershel “Woody” Williams*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Hershel_%22Woody%22_Williams_\(T-ESB-4\))  is expected to enter service in 2018. 

What is an expeditionary sea base? The [Military Sealift Command (MSC) defines the type as](http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=235): *An afloat forward staging base-variant of the mobile landing platform designed to provide dedicated support for air mine countermeasures and special warfare missions. The ship is capable of executing additional missions including counter-piracy, maritime security, and humanitarian and disaster relief. The platform supports a variety of rotary wing aircraft.*

In laymen’s terms, an expeditionary sea base appears to be a logistics base vessel with fuel, ammunition storage and repair facilities, which can also support helicopter and certain fixed wing planes. The *Puller* is the first purpose-built expeditionary sea base and is 784 feet long and features a 52,000 square-foot flight deck.

The *Puller* is expected to replace the [USS *Ponce,* which at 46 years old](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/07/update-uss-ponce-the-oldest-amphibious-transport-dock-ship-forward-command-post-and-commando-mothership-after-all/) is one of the Navy’s oldest vessels.  Unlike the *Ponce* , which is armed with two Phalanx close-in weapon systems, a pair of 25mm Bushmaster chain guns and a [semi-experimental laser weapon](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/11/update-us-navy-deploys-laser-weapon-on-uss-ponce-in-the-persian-gulf/), the *Puller*  does not have significant self-defense capabilities in weapons or electronic counter-measures. [Critics have suggested that she may be vulnerable](http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/12402/the-navys-gargantuan-new-sea-base-is-on-its-way-to-the-middle-east) in a Persian Gulf deployment. There is speculation that modular or even vehicle mounted defenses could be installed on the ship at some future date.
