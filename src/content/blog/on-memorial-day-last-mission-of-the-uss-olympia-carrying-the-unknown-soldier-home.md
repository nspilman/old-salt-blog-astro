On Memorial Day, an updated repost about the last mission of the [*USS Olympia*](http://www.phillyseaport.org/olympia) in 1921, when she carried an American unknown soldier killed during World War I  from a cemetery in France back to Washington to be entombed at Arlington National Cemetery.  The *Olympia* was decommissioned the following year. 

[USS *Olympia*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Olympia_\(C-6\)) is the oldest steel-hulled American warship afloat and Commodore George Dewey’s flagship during the [Battle of Manila Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manila_Bay) on May 1, 1898.  The ship is now a museum ship at Philadelphia’s [Independence Seaport Museum](http://www.phillyseaport.org/).

### [Memorial Day: Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery](http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore/Tomb-of-the-Unknown-Soldier)

  
*The Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va., is also known as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and has never been officially named. The Tomb of the Unknowns stands atop a hill overlooking Washington, D.C. On March 4, 1921, Congress approved the burial of an unidentified American soldier from World War I in the plaza of the new Memorial Amphitheater.*

*On Memorial Day, 1921, four unknowns were exhumed from four World War I American cemeteries in France. U.S. Army Sgt. Edward F. Younger, who was wounded in combat, highly decorated for valor and received the Distinguished Service Medal in “The Great War, the war to end all wars,” selected the Unknown Soldier of World War I from four identical caskets at the city hall in Chalons-sur-Marne, France, Oct. 24, 1921. Sgt. Younger selected the unknown by placing a spray of white roses on one of the caskets. He chose the third casket from the left. The chosen unknown soldier was transported to the United States aboard the USS Olympia.*

*From Châlons-sur-Marne, the Unknown journeyed by caisson and rail to the port town of Le Havre, France. From Le Havre, the USS Olympia transported the Unknown Soldier’s casket to Washington, D.C. The Unknown arrived at the Washington Navy Yard on November 9, 1921. After arriving in Washington, D.C. on November 9, 1921, the Unknown lay in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. About 90,000 visitors paid their respects during the public visiting period on November 10, 1921.*
