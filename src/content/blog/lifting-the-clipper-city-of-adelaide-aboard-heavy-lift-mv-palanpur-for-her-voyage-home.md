According to the [latest news on their website](http://cityofadelaide.org.au/), the [*City of Adelaide*,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Adelaide_\(1864\)) the oldest surviving composite clipper ship built in 1864, will be hoisted onto the deck of the heavy-lift ship [MV](http://www.kestrelmaritime.com/services/fleet/combi-lift-heavy-lift-shipping-fleet/mv-palanpur) *[Palanpur](http://www.kestrelmaritime.com/services/fleet/combi-lift-heavy-lift-shipping-fleet/mv-palanpur)* in the port of Rotterdam today.  The heavy-lift ship will carry the historic clipper home to her name-sake city in Australia with several intermediate stops along the way.  But, how does one lift 500 tonnes of historic ship and cradle onto the deck of a heavy-lift ship? The obvious answer is  — carefully.  For a more detailed answer watch the simulation below.
