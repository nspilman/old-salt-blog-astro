![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/02/pride2shortfall.jpg)In 2016, we posted about a [public-private partnership](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/01/maryland-1-5-million-partnership-pride-baltimore-ii/) between the State of Maryland and the replica Baltimore clipper, [*Pride of Baltimore II*](http://www.pride2.org/). It appears likely that the partnership may not be renewed, leaving a $500,000 shortfall in funding which may curtail this year’s sailing season unless sufficient money can be raised.

From the [Pride of Baltimore II organization press release](http://www.pride2.org/featured/pride-battling-financial-headwinds/):

“*Pride of Baltimore II remains one of the world’s most revered tall ships, delighting crowds wherever she sails,” said Pride of Baltimore, Inc. board chair Captain Eric Nielsen. “We will use 2018 to reassess the ship’s future, working closely with our partners in the public and private sectors to make sure we don’t witness the end to Pride’s wonderful history.”*

*Instead of taking part in public events, Pride II is undergoing maintenance early in the year as part of a 30-year refit of the vessel, which was launched in 1988.  Without significant new funding, Pride II will likely not be able to maintain an active sailing schedule in 2018.*

*Pride II was owned by the state of Maryland from 1988 to 2008, and now is both owned and operated by Pride of Baltimore, Inc., a nonprofit entity funded through grants, individual gifts, corporate support, and income from festival appearances and other sources.*

*The state has provided significant funding for Pride of Baltimore over the years, and most recently through a three-year commitment through early 2018. The Pride organization is exploring legislation to allocate state funding for Pride during this year’s General Assembly session.*
