![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/covid.jpg)If anyone doubts that the coronavirus pandemic is having a negative impact on the national defense of the United States, one need only look at the expanding Covid-19 hotspot in the White House itself. A recent [leaked FEMA memo said that at least 34 people](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/34-people-connected-white-house-previously-infected-coronavirus/story?id=73487381) connected with the White House have tested positive for the virus.

Among that number, Coast Guard Admiral Charles Ray tested positive on Monday. Ray had attended a [maskless indoor reception for Gold Star military families](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/10/06/joint-chiefs-isolation-after-coast-guard-admiral-tests-positive-coronavirus-pentagon-says/) at the White House on September 27.

Because Admiral Ray also attended a meeting in the “tank” — the Pentagon’s secure conference room for senior military leaders, those who attended including most of the nation’s [Joint Chiefs of Staff are now self-quarantining.](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/06/coast-guard-covid-positive-426799) Also attending the meeting was [USMC General Gary Thomas](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-archive-gary-l-thomas-coast-guard-59e19109d15d6f10eeb0417ec961d80d), the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, who tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday.

Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander [Jayna McCarron](https://heavy.com/news/jayna-mccarron/) has also tested positive for the virus. McCarron is one of five presidential military aides, one from each service, who provide a range of services for the president, most notably carrying ‘the football,’ the briefcase containing the nuclear launch codes.

The president’s military valet who tested positive has not been identified.
