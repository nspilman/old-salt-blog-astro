*Join us for a one of a kind outdoor adventure aboard the 1877 Iron Barque ELISSA! 2020 sees the Official Tall Ship of Texas return to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico for her annual daysail series. As one of the oldest, and longest continuously sailed vessels in the world, the annual daysails keep her where she works best, with her sails down, sailing in the Gulf waters.*

*GHF is able to offer a limited number of ELISSA daysail spots on board as a sail training student. As a sail training student, participants will experience what life was like as a 19th-century sailor. The program includes both hands-on and lecture learning, focusing on setting sails and maneuvering the 142-year-old ship through the Gulf of Mexico. Come with us on this journey through the past and experience your own piece of history.*
