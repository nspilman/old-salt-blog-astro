![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/usskidd.jpg)[USS *Kidd*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Kidd_\(DDG-100\)), an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, was [diverted to San Diego following a shipboard outbreak of the coronavirus](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/coronavirus-cases-aboard-uss-kidd-rise-as-destroyer-docks-in-san-diego/2314836/). The ship had been deployed off South America on an anti-drug-trafficking mission when the outbreak occurred. So far, 64 of the crew on the *Kidd* have tested positive, or roughly 27% of the sailors tested so far. 

While on its way to San Diego, the *Kidd* rendezvoused with the amphibious assault ship [USS *Makin Island*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Makin_Island_\(LHD-8\)) which is [equipped with an onboard intensive care unit staffed by a fleet surgical team](https://news.usni.org/2020/04/26/2-uss-kidd-sailors-evacuated-as-covid-19-outbreak-spreads-uss-makin-island-steaming-to-assist) to assist with care and screening of the crew. 

Once alongside in San Diego, the Navy immediately began to moved the crew ashore for isolation and treatment and has begun to disinfect and decontaminate the ship. 

As of late last week, 26 US Navy ships have reported at least one case of COVID-19 among their crews. Only the *Kidd* and the aircraft carrier *Theodore Roosevelt* have suffered outbreaks while at sea. [Navy officials said Monday](https://www.navytimes.com/2020/04/27/20-percent-of-theodore-roosevelt-crew-test-positive-for-covid-19/) that 955 *Roosevelt* sailors have active cases of the novel coronavirus or approximately 20 percent of the ship’s 4,800-person crew.
