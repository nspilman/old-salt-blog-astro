[Jeanne Socrates](http://svnereida.com/), a 70 year old British grandmother, has [rounded the Cape of Good Hope on her sailboat, *Nereida*](http://www.winlink.org/dotnet/maps/PositionReportsDetail.aspx?callsign=KC2IOV), in her attempt to become the oldest non-stop solo circumnavigator.  She left Victoria, British Columbia in October and successfully rounded Cape Horn in January.  She is now setting a course to round Australia’s Cape Leeuwin.  This is Ms. Socrates’ third attempt at a solo non-stop circumnavigation. She has already completed two previous solo-circumnavigations but on each needed to put into port for repairs, after a grounding and a knock-down damaged her sailboat.  Best of luck Jeanne. No doubt the third time is a charm.  Thanks to Sheila and R. Bruce Macdonald for passing along the news.
