How did a crew of highly skilled professionals, sailing the $6 million [*Team Vestas Wind*](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/teams/49_Team-Vestas-Wind.html) in the current [Volvo Ocean Race](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/home.html), succeed in hitting the [Cargados Carajos shoals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Brandon), in the Indian Ocean off Mauritius at [16 knots on the night of November 29, 2014](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/11/team-vesta-wind-runs-aground-on-mauritius-reef-in-volvo-ocean-race/)?  An [independent accident report](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/static/assets/content_v2/media/files/m36616_team-vestas-wind-inquiry-report-released-on-9-march-2015.pdf) was released at the end of January which looked into the causes of the grounding.

Despite having state of the art electronic chartplotting systems and software, the navigator plotted a course that crossed what he thought was a seamount with a depth of 40 meters. Instead, they sailed straight into a reef.  Remarkably, no one was seriously hurt and the crew successfully evacuated the Volvo Ocean 65.

How did the navigator make such a mistake? He relied on his chartplotter which did not show the hazards of the Cargados Carajos shoals, except when zoomed fully in. There were a full set of paper charts aboard which would have shown the reefs. The reefs were also described in the *Sailing Directions* and *Pilot Book*, but neither were aboard the boat. The accident report found that the position of the Cargados Carajos shoals was accurately represented on the paper and electronic charts.  The Cargados Carajos shoals (also known as St. Brandon) were named by Portuguese sailors in 1506.

The *Team Vestas Wind* navigator, Wouter Verbraak, is a highly experienced sailor, navigator and weather router. As noted in the accident report, “*He co-skippered the Open 60 Hugo Boss in the 2010-2011 Barcelona World Race (double handed). In 2001 he had completed two legs in the Volvo Ocean Race as co-navigator. In the 2008 Volvo Ocean Race he sailed nine out of ten legs as navigator. His sailing credentials included an America’s Cup, Admirals Cup, TP52 Med Cup, Middle Sea Race, Fastnet, TransPacific, Cape Town to Bahia Race, two TransAtlantic Races and the Sydney to Hobart. He co-skippered in the Volvo Baltic Race and advised sailors on strategy and weather in the Vendee, Route du Rhum, the Jacques Vabre and the Olympics. Wouter and Chris Nicholson sailed together as skipper and navigator on Rambler 90 in the Maxi-Worlds in 2007 and on the same boat in the same year as watch captain and navigator in the TransAtlantic Race.*”

Toward the end of December,  24 days after running aground, [*Team Vestas Wind* was salvaged](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/12/recovery-of-the-volvo-ocean-racer-vestas-wind/).  The Volvo Ocean 65 is now being repaired at Persico’s boatyard in Italy in hopes of returning to the race in June. When she returns, the boat will have a new navigator aboard.  Wouter Verbraak was r[eleased from the team in January](http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2015/01/23/wouter-verbraak-released-team-vestas-wind/).
