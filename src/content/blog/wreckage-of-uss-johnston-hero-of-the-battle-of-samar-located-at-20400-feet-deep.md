![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/johnston.jpg)The RV *Petrel* continues its amazing streak of underwater discoveries. Now, it has located the wreckage of what is believed to be the [USS *Johnston*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Johnston_\(DD-557\)) at a depth of 20,400 ft in the Philippine Sea. The wreck is believed to be the deepest wreck of a warship ever discovered. [According to Guinness World Records](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7635195/Deepest-shipwreck-discovered-USS-Johnston-sunk-WWII-20-400ft-Philippine-Sea.html), the deepest wreck before the discovery of the USS *Johnston* was a German vessel discovered at 18,904ft.

The destroyer was sunk in the Battle of Samar on October 25, 1944. We recently posted about the [75th anniversary of the battle](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/10/seventy-five-years-ago-today-battle-off-samar-a-victory-against-all-odds/) in which, against all odds, a handful of US Navy destroyers and destroyer escorts drove off a Japanese fleet of 23 ships, including battleships and heavy cruisers, saving the landings at Leyte Gulf from likely destruction.  

The USS *Johnston* lead the attack against the overwhelming Japanese force. The *Johnston* seriously damaged and forced the withdrawal of a Japanese heavy cruiser as well as hitting several other Japanese cruisers and destroyers before the *Johnston* was sunk herself, with the loss of 186 sailors.

The wreckage sighted has not yet been confirmed as the USS *Johnston.  “*This wreck is either the *Johnston* or the USS [*Hoel*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Hoel_\(DD-533\))” [the Petrel team said](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/uss-johnston-ship-wreck-found-leyte-gulf-world-war-2-rv-petrel-paul-allen-a9178821.html). “This wreck is in the southern part of where the battle took place and this is one of the reasons why we believe this is the *Johnston*, because she sank later, after Hoel did.”
