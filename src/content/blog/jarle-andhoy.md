[Jarle Andhøy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarle_Andh%C3%B8y) calls himself as a [“Wild Viking.”](http://www.wildvikings.com/)  He has been the subject of the Norwegian television series *Berserk mot Nordpolen* (“Berserk to the North Pole”), *Berserk til Valhall* (“Berserk to Valhalla”) and *Berserk gjennom Nordvestpassasjen* (“Berserk through the Northwest Passage”) which aired on [NRK](http://www.nrk.no/) in 2003, 2005 and 2007.   Andhøy is best known for controversial voyages in polar regions usually without permits, or insurance, which have run afoul of the authorities in Norway, Finland, Russia and New Zealand.  He was deported from Canada in 2007. His [voyage last year to the Antarctic also got three of his crew killed](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/25/off-antarctica-hope-fades-for-crew-of-yacht-berserk-ii/) when his yacht *Berserk II* sank.

Andhøy appears to be at it again. He has on another illegal voyage to Antarctica and is wanted by the authorities in several countries.  
  
He and 19 year old New Zealander, Samuel Massie, are sailing from New Zealand toward Antarctica in his new 54-foot yacht, *Nilaya.*  Andhøy told a Norwegian newspaper that he is heading to Antarctica to find out exactly what happened to his three crew and their yacht last year. After being notified by the Norwegian government that Andhøy was attempting another unauthorized voyage, the New Zealand Customs Service undertook a sea and air searches for the yacht.

Andhøy’s yacht has reportedly been spotted in international waters but has not responded to radio hails in repeated fly-bys.  Andhøy has no EPIRB on board and reportedly does not want to be rescued if something goes wrong.

Last February, Jarle Andhøy and Samuel Massie set off from the yacht Berserk II in McMurdo Sound on the Antarctic coast in an attempt to drove ATVs towards the South Pole.  Shortly thereafter, in an Antarctic storm, the EPIRB from the *Berserk II* was activated.  Following an extensive search by the New Zealand Coast Guard and private ships, the only sign of the yacht or the three crew aboard was [debris and an empty life raft](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/4704566/Damaged-liferaft-found-in-Antarctic).  Andhøy’s ill-fated expedition was mounted without authorization or insurance. He later paid a fine of 25,000 NOK to the [Norwegian Polar Institute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Polar_Institute "Norwegian Polar Institute").
