Here is a fun time-lapse of the 1939 built Alden schooner, *[When And If](https://sailwhenandif.com/an-historic-vessel/)*, overtaking the schooner [*America 2.0*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/06/closer-look-america-2-0-replica-hybrid-high-tech-schooner/) in the [34th Annual Schooner Wharf Bar Wrecker’s Cup Race](https://schoonerwharf.com/19wreckersrace3.htm) in Key West, FL.  *When And If*  was built for General  George S. Patton who wrote that “When the war is over, and If I live through it, Bea and I are going to sail her around the world.” 

America 2.0 was designed and built by the Scarano brothers and delivered in 2011. The schooner is a modern interpretation of the yacht America of 1851.  Operated by Classic Harbor lines, they refer to new schooner as a “[tribute to the first schooner America](https://www.sail-nyc.com/our-boats/america-2-0/).”
