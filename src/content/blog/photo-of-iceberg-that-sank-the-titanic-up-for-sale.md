![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/11/ht_titanic_iceberg.jpg)No one aboard the [*Titanic*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) took a photograph of the iceberg that sank the famous ship in 1912, but two sailors made sketches of the berg, which had a distinctly elliptical shape. It so happens that two days before, what appears to be the same iceberg was photographed by Captain W.F. Wood of [S.S. *Etonian*](http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/industry/images/?action=show_item&item=2662) as they, unlike the *Titanic*,  passed the berg without hitting it. That photograph is coming up for auction, along with 400 articles of Titanic memorabilia by [RR Auction](http://www.rrauction.com/). Bidding opens Dec. 13. The photo of the iceberg is expected to go for $8,000 to $10,000. Thanks to Dave Shirlaw on the Marine History list for pointing it out.
