![uboatkent](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/uboatkent.jpg)There was a [recent story in the press](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10530074/Historic-wreckage-of-German-First-World-War-U-boat-revealed-in-low-tide.html) about  the wreckage of a German World War I submarine beached of mudflats on the banks of the River Medway in Hoo, Kent.   The sub is, believed to be the [UB-122](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM_UB-122),  one of the roughly 100 German submarines turned over to Britain at the end of the war.  The sub has been on the mudflats since 1921, but is in a remote area and is intermittently visible, depending on the tides and the action of storms.  As reported in the [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2526946/A-monster-British-coast-Rusting-hulk-World-War-One-German-U-boat-marooned-Kent-island-century.html):

*Yesterday marine archaeologist Mark Dunkley, the maritime designation adviser for English Heritage, said:*  *‘Records show that the diesel engines were cut out of UB-122 and reused in a cement works at Halling in Kent – the U-boat’s power plants thus serviced Britain’s post-war industrial development.*

*‘What we still don’t know is exactly why or how UB-122 ended where it is. It’s likely it was being taken up the Medway estuary to be broken up for scrap. Perhaps in a storm it parted from its tow, the cable snapped, and the prevailing winds blew it to Hoo.*

*‘As to why it was left there, we can only speculate. It could have been too much of an effort to get to it, or perhaps it was a problem of navigation in how to get to it.*

*‘Its interest is that it is the only known complete U-boat that can be seen in British tidal waters.’*

The reappearance of the UB-122, I found myself wondering how many how many derelict or abandoned submarines might still be hanging around.  Apparently there are quite a few, from a wrecked [Japanese Type A midget submarine](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulbjones/5645378352/) ashore on Kiska Island, in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska to the remains of two [XT-Craft midget submarines in Aberlady Bay, Scotland, UK](http://coastkid.blogspot.com/2012/01/ww2-xt-class-submarine-wrecks-aberlady.html), to an assortment of abandoned Soviet submarines.  For a  better list be sure to check out [There’s nothing sadder than the wreck of a once-great submarine](http://io9.com/the-hulking-grandeur-of-abandoned-submarines-510071935).
