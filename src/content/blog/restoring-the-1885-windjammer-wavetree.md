The *[Wavertree](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/visit/street-of-ships/wavertree/)*, an iron-hulled windjammer built in 1885, has been a museum ship in at New York’s [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/) since 1969. In May, the historic ship shifted to the [Caddell Dry Dock](http://www.caddelldrydock.com/) in Staten Island to undergo stabilization and restoration. The $10.6 million dollar project is one of the largest of its kind undertaken by a museum in the United States.  The *Wavertree* was built in Southampton, England and was one of the last large sailing ships built of wrought iron. She is one of the largest iron sailing vessel afloat.
