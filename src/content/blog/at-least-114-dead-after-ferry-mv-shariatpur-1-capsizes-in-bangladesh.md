Yesterday, the *MV-Shariatpur-1*, a ferry crossing the the Meghna River, just south of the capital, Dhaka, in Bangladesh, collided with a cargo vessel in early morning darkness. The ferry capsized and sank, killing at least 114 of the more than 200 passengers believed to be aboard.  Around 35 passengers have been reported to have been rescued.

The story has a sad sameness.  As reported by [CNN](http://articles.cnn.com/2012-03-13/asia/world_asia_bangladesh-ferry-sinking_1_ferry-capsizes-munshiganj-ferry-accidents?_s=PM:ASIA): *Ferry accidents are common on Bangladesh’s vast river network. Hundreds of people die in such accidents every year as the operators often ignore rules. Nearly 4,000 people are estimated to have lost their lives in ferry accidents since 1977.*
