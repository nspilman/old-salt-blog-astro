The [Mermaid Parade](http://www.coneyisland.com/mermaid.shtml) has been held on Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York since 1983.  And I missed it again this year.  Damn. Maybe next year.  Fortunately, the intrepid Will Van Dorp was on hand with his camera.   Check out his [Tugster blog](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2012/06/23/solstice-post-2/) for more photos.

The parade started as a beginning of summer celebration for workers in the Coney Island and grew to attract artists and performers from around the country. The event attracts thousands of particiapnts and hundreds of thousands of spectators.  It is billed as the “largest art parade in the US” and often is claimed to be the largest art parade in the world.  Parade founder Dick Zigun say,  “It’s nautical. It’s naughty. There is a little bit of nudity, but it’s not New Orleans, it’s Brooklyn style.”
