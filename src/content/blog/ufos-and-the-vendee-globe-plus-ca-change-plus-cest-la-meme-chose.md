![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/vg200.jpg)Of the 33 IMOCAs which started the [Vendee Globe Race](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en), four have officially abandoned. Two, *Hugo Boss* and Arkea Paprec, were damaged after striking Unidentified Floating Objects (UFOs). A third boat, Sam Davies’ *Initiatives Coeur* was also damaged by a UFO collision. Davies is now evaluating whether she will be able to stay in the race. *Corum L’Épargne*, sailed by Nicolas Troussel, quit the race after dismasting, and *PRB* sank after an apparent structural failure.

In considering the status of the race, the French phrase, plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose, ( the more things change, the more they stay the same) comes to mind. Looking back at the 2016-2017 Vendee Globe Race, little seems to have changed. Four years ago, UFOs were the largest single cause of damage to the fleet.

As we wrote in our post “[The Cluttered Ocean — UFOs and the Vendee Globe](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/12/cluttered-ocean-ufos-vendee-globe/)” of December 20, 2016: “So far, of the original 29 competitors in the Vendee Globe singlehanded around the world race, 5 have been forced to retire after being damaged by collisions with UFOs, unidentified floating objects. Another boat, *Hugo Boss*, sailed by Alex Thomson, lost a foil daggerboard to a UFO, but has managed to keep sailing, and is now still in second place.  Three other Vendee Globe racers have retired for reasons not related to collisions — two due to dis-masting and the other from damage to a foil in heavy weather.”
