Nyad had covered about 92 statute miles over the 40 hour swim, two-thirds of the journey from Cuba to Florida, but her doctors were concerned that toxins were building up in her body from the repeated stings.

*Nyad arrived Sunday evening in Key West, where she spoke with reporters. She walked off her boat “Sunluver” wearing a white bathrobe, her face and lips swollen from the stings, and pulled up a sleeve to show a long cross-shaped welt on her right forearm.*

*“It’s such a bitter pill,” she said. “I am so capable of that swim. That’s the end though.”* 

*“Because if it was the weather or Tylenol, but those damned jellyfish,” she added.*  

*Nyad said that as she swam, she felt paralysis in her back. She recalled swimming through the two stings, which she described as like something out of a sci-fi movie when the tentacles whipped across her.*

*“I went through two of them and I kept swimming,” said Nyad, who wore long pants and a long-sleeved shirt while swimming. Her clothing covered everything but her hands feet and lips, and she got stung in the lips.*

*“My lips are like Angelina’s,” she quipped.*
