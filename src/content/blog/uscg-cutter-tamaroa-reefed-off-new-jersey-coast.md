[Sinking of the USCGC Tamaroa](https://youtu.be/hKcLyUSLpBY)

Built in 1943 as USS *Zuni*, the 205-foot fleet ocean/salvage tug and one of seventy Cherokee-class fleet tugs saw service in World War II in campaigns in the Marianas, the Philippines, and at Iwo Jima.  After the war, she was transferred to the US Coast Guard and renamed *Tamaroa.*  

USCGC *Tamaroa* had a 48 year long career in US Coast Guard, serving on safety patrols, in drug interdiction and fisheries protection. She was the first Coast Guard Cutter to arrive at the sinking passenger liner [*Andrea Doria*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Andrea_Doria) after the collision with the the Swedish liner *Stockholm* 1956. *Tamaroa* may be best known for rescuing the crew of the yacht *Satori,* as well as the crew of a downed Air National Guard helicopter during the “[Perfect Storm” of 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Perfect_Storm),  
described in Sebastian Junger’s book, [*The Perfect Storm*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perfect_Storm_\(book\)).
