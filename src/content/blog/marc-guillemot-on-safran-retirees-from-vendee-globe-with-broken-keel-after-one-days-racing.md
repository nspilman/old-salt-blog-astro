Safran with intact titanium keel

[Marc Guillemot](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skipper/9/marc-guillemot.html), sailing *[Safran](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skipper/9/marc-guillemot.html#boat),* was a favorite to win the [Vendée Globe](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/) non-stop round-the-world single-handed yacht race, yet only one day into the race, he was forced to turn back due to a broken keel.  Fifty miles into the race, he reported hearing a “loud bang.”  Guillemot’s [Open 60](http://www.windathletes.ca/programs/open-60) class boat, *Safran,* features a hollow titanium fin keel, a fairly radical departure from the solid steel keels first used in the design.  Guillemot’s team does not have a spare keel, forcing him to retire from the race.

This is not the first time that Guillemot has faced a keel failure. In the 2009 Vendée Globe, *Safran* lost her keel 900 miles from the finish of the race, yet Guillemot made it across the finish line and placed third overall.
