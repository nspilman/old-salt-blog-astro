I remember being at a Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers conference in Hawaii close to forty years ago, listening to [Rudy Choy](http://www.choydesign.com/default.htm), a Hawaiian naval architect, known best for his sailing catamaran designs.   As I recall Choy, who sadly died last year, was not a fan of [Thor Heyerdahl.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl)  Heyerdahl had become famous for sailing downwind from Peru to Polynesia on the balsa raft, [*Kon-Tiki*.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kon-Tiki)  Choy, and many others, believed that early Polynesian voyagers had traveled purposely across the Pacific, including sailing against the wind, rather than simply drifting, like flotsam, as suggested by Heyerdahl’s theories.  Choy was one of the designers of a *waʻa kaulua, a* double-hulled voyaging canoe, that would prove Heyerdahl wrong. (Later, DNA studies would also confirm that the Polynesians sailed from west to east.)  The voyaging canoe was the *[Hōkūleʻa](http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/)*, and since being launched on March 8, 1975, she has completed ten major voyages, all across the Pacific, including sailing to Tahiti, Micronesia, the United States and Japan.

After sailing for more than three decades, the *Hōkūleʻa* was put into drydock and completely rebuilt down to her original hulls.  She is now several feet wider and a thousand pounds lighter. Following sea trials, she will sail to all the islands in the state before commencing a [worldwide voyage](http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/holokai/wwv/wwv_mission.html) in June of 2013.
