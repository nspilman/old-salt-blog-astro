Costa Fortuna

In May 2005, while the cruise ship *[Costa Fortuna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Fortuna)* was making a close approach to the island of Sorrento, [there was a “loud bang” after which the vessel rolled from left to right](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4081095/Costa-Concordia-bosses-blamed-previous-accident-of-Costa-Fortuna-in-2005-on-crash-with-whale.html) according to the ship’s photographer Roberto Cappello, 59.  He later would photograph damage to the ship’s keel and a broken propeller blade, only to have the photographs and files confiscated by Costa.  Costa apparently later claimed that the ship had stuck a whale.  [Italian magistrates will be asked to investigate](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10780866) whether Costa Cruises attempted to cover-up the previous grounding.  
  
Costa’s service record is hardly unblemished.  In October of 2010, [we posted about the collision between the *Costa Classica* and a cargo vessel](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/10/20/an-ill-fated-cruise-for-the-costa-classica/) at the mouth of the Yangtze River, leaving a 60 feet long gash in the side of the ship. Three passengers were hospitalized but there there were no fatalities.  The *Costa Classica* was also involved in a collision with the *MSC Poesia* in June of 2008. There were no injuries.

In February of 2010, three crew members were killed and three passengers injured when the [Costa Europa struck a pier](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1254094/British-tourists-hurt-cruise-liner-crash-killed-crew-members.html) in high winds in the Egyptian port of Sharm el-Sheikh.  In 2009, the *Costa Europa’s “*Jewels of the Indian Ocean*”* cruise was beset by a range of mechanical failures leading to the cancellation of several port calls and a near mutiny by passengers. [Costa Failure](http://costafailure.blogspot.com/).

One concern is that even serious incidents are not always reported.  Although three crew members died when the *Costa Europa* struck the pier in Egypt, the casualty was never submitted to IMO’s Marine Casualties database.
