[Kitsap Maritime Heritage Foundation](kitsapmaritime.org) has announced that Seattle attorney [Mike Withey](witheylaw.com) is donating the 65′ schooner, *Fiddler’s Dream*, to the foundation.   KMHF was founded in March of 2012 with the stated purpose of being the premiere venue in the Puget Sound region for seekers of an historic seafaring experience; to bring a “tall ship,” or masted sailing vessel, to Kitsap County. The organization’s main emphasis involves exposing elementary-age school children to the ship and knowledgeable volunteers—to be a resource for history and social studies programs throughout the county who want to expose their students to first-hand knowledge of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math).
