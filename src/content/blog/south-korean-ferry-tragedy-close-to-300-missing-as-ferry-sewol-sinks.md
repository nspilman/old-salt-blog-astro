What was intended as a four-day field trip to the Korean resort island of Jeju for high school students and their teachers ended in tragedy when the [ferry sank off several miles north of Byeongpung Island](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27045512), on the west coast of Korea. There are reports of 4 known dead and roughly 300 people still missing.

The 146m-long ferry, [Sewol](http://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/440000400/vessel:SEWOL), left the port of Inchon with 459 people aboard bound for Jeju Island.  Among the passengers were 338 students and teachers from Danwon High School in Ansan, a suburb of Seoul.  The ferry had a capacity for 900 people and ran a twice weekly service to Jeju Island. There are reports that the ferry either hit a rock or collided with another vessel.

“There was a bang, and then the ship suddenly tilted over,” a survivor identified by his surname Yoo told Yonhap News Agency. “Downstairs were restaurants, shops and entertainment rooms, and those who were there are feared to have failed to escape.”

At least 18 helicopters, 34 vessels and special-operations divers, arrived at the scene following a distress signal that was picked up at 9 a.m. local time.
