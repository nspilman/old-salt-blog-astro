![American-Eagle-sailing-in-M](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/10/American-Eagle-sailing-in-M.jpg)The [schooner *American Eagle* is for sale](http://www.yachtworld.com/boats/1930/Gloucester-Fishing-Schooner-2612914/Rockland/ME/United-States#.UlQBfVDjaUU).  I have long been an admirer of the  *[American Eagle](http://www.schooneramericaneagle.com/)* from afar.   She was the the last fishing schooner built in Gloucester in 1930. After a long career, the old and tired fishing vessel was purchased by Captain John Foss in 1983, who spent two years rebuilding her and who put her in the cruise trade, where she has been delighting guests ever since.  In addition to being beautiful, she is also very fast.  The *American Eagle* has won the [Esperanto Cup](http://gloucesterschoonerfestival.net/?page_id=35) at the [Annual Gloucester Schooner Festival](http://gloucesterschoonerfestival.net/) an [amazing ten times since 1986](http://gloucesterschoonerfestival.net/?page_id=39), winning the last two years straight.

Whenever we post about a ship or yacht for sale, we also post a note that we have no interest in the sale and that those interested should [contact the broker](http://www.yachtworld.com/boats/1930/Gloucester-Fishing-Schooner-2612914/Rockland/ME/United-States#.UlQADlDjaUX).  Nevertheless, we always receive inquires about purchasing the vessel in question. So once again, for the record, we are no way involved in the sale of the schooner *American Eagle*.  We are posting about her because we appreciate the grace and magic of this classic schooner. We hope that she continues sailing for many years to come.

The [video below](http://youtu.be/u0v4zVYdNO8) does a great job of capturing the experience of sailing aboard *American Eagle*.
