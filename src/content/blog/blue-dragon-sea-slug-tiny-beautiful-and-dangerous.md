![bluedragon](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bluedragon.jpg)The words “blue dragon” and “sea slug” do not seem to go together. The image of a dragon, of any color, and a slug just do not seem to overlap. Nevertheless, the sea slug [glaucus atlanticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucus_atlanticus) known as the blue dragon (as well as the sea swallow, blue angel, and the blue ocean slug) does look and act more ferociously than its size or designation might suggest.

The strangely beautiful but tiny sea slug only grows to about an inch and a half long. It floats on the surface of the ocean and is known to prey on the much larger [Portuguese Man o’ War](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/09/the-amazing-and-painful-portuguese-man-o-war-an-organism-or-a-colony/). The blue dragon is immune to the Man o’ War’s toxins. Indeed, the blue dragon concentrates its toxins so that it can produce a more powerful and deadly sting than the Man o’ War. Humans handling the blue dragon may receive a very painful and potentially dangerous sting. There is a video about this remarkable sea slug, after the page break.
