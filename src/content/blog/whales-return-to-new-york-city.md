For many years, whales were never seen close to New York City.   In the last few years, that has changed.   We have seen humpbacks in the harbor (see [here](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/09/26/unexpected-whale-watching-in-new-york-harbor/#more-10766) and [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/10/nyregion/10whale.html).)  We have also had [dead humpbacks](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/11/humpback-whale-washes-ashore-on-new-yorks-jones-beach/) wash up on local beaches.   Large numbers of humpbacks and fin whales returned last year to Montauk on the other end of the  Log Island.   [Harbor seals](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/04/23/april-in-new-york-harbor-seals-new-boats-and-floaters/) are even showing up in the inner harbor.

From the [Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/30/2011-01-30_whales_return_to_new_york_city_massive_mammals_appearing_again_in_seas_near_city.html):

*Whales, dolphins and seals have made a triumphant return to the waters just outside New York Harbor – and the comeback has even sparked whale and seal-watching tours.*

*Tom Paladino, captain of two ferry boats from the Rockaways, says pods of aquatic mammals off the city’s coast have “increased tenfold.”*

*“We used to see 10 whales a year – now we see 100,” he said. “We saw dolphins almost on a daily basis between June and September.”*

*There are so many more seals in New York Harbor that earlier this month he started weekend tours on his ferry, American Princess.*

*On one trip last weekend, he counted 14 lolling on a small island off Staten Island.*

*Cornell University Prof. Chris Clark estimates that as many as 30 to 50 fin whales now live full-time in the waters just past the Verrazano Bridge.*

*Acoustical monitors installed by Cornell in and near the harbor discovered six species of whales touring the New York-New Jersey bite – “a real menagerie of giants,” he said.*

*Experts say anti-hunting laws and cleaner waters may have brought back whales and their cousins after being largely absent for a century.*

*The numbers are “far, far more than expected, even for me,” Clark said. “I’ve been surprised elsewhere in the world, but off New York – yikes!”*

*Much of the data was collected by a federally funded study by Cornell and the state Department of Environmental Conservation.*

*When acoustical traps were laid in New York waters in 2008, researchers were surprised to hear not only the 20-minute serenades of humpbacks, but a cacophony of other fish making a racket, Clark said.*

*“Black drum fish lit up the night with their choruses. Males were out there singing their hearts out: ‘Hey Baby! Hey Baby! Hey Baby!’ There’s a cornucopia of life 10 miles off the Verrazano Bridge. It’s mind-boggling!” he said.*

*Officials said the study was supposed to last three years but was abandoned when a DEC official overseeing the project quit to get her doctorate. Budget cuts made it impossible to hire a replacement.*

*Clark said the whale study needs to be revived because no one knows the extent of whale activity around New York Harbor – or how best to protect them.*
