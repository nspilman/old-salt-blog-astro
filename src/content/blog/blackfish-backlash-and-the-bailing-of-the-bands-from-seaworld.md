![blackfish-poster](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/blackfish-poster.jpg)This year, [Seaworld Orlando](http://seaworldparks.com/en/seaworld-orlando) is sponsoring “[Bands, Brew and BBQ](http://seaworldparks.com/en/seaworld-orlando/Events/Bands-Brew-and-BBQ)” during February and early March. There may be fewer bands to go with the BBQ and brew than originally planned. At least seven well known performers and bands have pulled out from performing at the event due to what some are calling the “*Blackfish* effect.”  So far, [REO Speedwagon](http://www.tmz.com/2013/12/13/reo-speedwagon-seaworld-concert-protest-blackfish-trisha-yearwood/), [Trisha Yearwood](http://www.rttnews.com/2239693/trisha-yearwood-cancels-seaworld-performance.aspx?type=ent), [Willie Nelson](http://www.newsday.com/travel/heart-willie-nelson-prompted-by-blackfish-documentary-cancel-planned-seaworld-performances-1.6577212), [Cheap Trick](http://entertainment.time.com/2013/12/11/the-documentary-blackfish-is-still-creating-waves-for-seaworld/), [Heart](http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/08/showbiz/seaworld-heart-blackfish/), [Barenaked Ladies](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/27/showbiz/bare-naked-ladies-seaworld-blackfish/) and [Martina McBride](http://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/op-ed-blackfish-effect-continues-five-acts-cancel-seaworld-gigs/article/363908) have cancelled SeaWorld concerts. Most of the performers have said that they cancelled after watching the documentary, *Blackfish*.  Joan Jett, who was not scheduled to perform, has [demanded that SeaWorld stop using her signature tune, “I Love Rock and Roll,”](http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/11/showbiz/seaworld-joan-jett-blackfish/index.html) as the opening music for its ‘Shamu Rocks’ killer whale show.

At this point it is difficult to say who will be performing at SeaWorld’s “Bands, Brew and BBQ” as SeaWorld has removed the performance schedule from their website.

*[Blackfish](http://blackfishmovie.com/)* is a 2013 documentary film directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, which focuses on the killing of SeaWorld trainer, Dawn Brancheau, by the orca whale, Tilikum. The documentary raises the larger issue of whether orcas should be kept in captivity.  The documentary was broadcast on CNN on October 24, 2011 and on on BBC Four in the UK on November 21, 2013.

The cancellation of the musical groups has continued to keep SeaWorld and Blackfish in the public eye. As reported by the [Orlando Sentine](http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-12-11/business/os-seaworld-blackfish-impact-20131211_1_seaworld-orlando-tilikum-blackfish)l, *“The cancellations are helping sustain “Blackfish” in the public consciousness, raising the risk that the film and its criticisms could do lasting damage to SeaWorld’s brand.*

*“It keeps the candle burning on ‘Blackfish,'” said Dennis Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services Inc., a consulting firm in Cincinnati. “It’s kind of like a snowball: It starts to roll, and then it gets bigger.”*

*“I don’t agree with the way they treat their animals. … What they do at SeaWorld is not OK,” Willie Nelson said in an interview with CNN. (SeaWorld initially said that Nelson canceled because of “scheduling conflicts.”)*

*Criticism from such high-profile figures could ultimately prove very damaging for SeaWorld, said David Kirby, author of the book “Death at SeaWorld,” which, like “Blackfish,” focuses on Tilikum and Dawn Brancheau’s death.*

*“I think the ripple effect is even greater. Only so many people are going to see a documentary or read a book. But everybody knows who Willie Nelson is,” Kirby said.*
