![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lauramaersk.jpg)Back in 2021, we [posted about a pledge made by Maersk](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/02/maersk-to-operate-first-carbon-neutral-containership-by-2023/) that it would launch the world’s first carbon-neutral cargo liner vessel in 2023 – seven years ahead of its initial 2030 target. This week, Maersk fulfilled that pledge, when its new feeder ship sailing on green methanol embarked on its maiden voyage on July 17. The new ship, to be officially named *Laura Maersk* in September, departed Ulsan, South Korea on an 11,000 nautical-mile voyage to Copenhagen, Denmark, before entering service in the Baltic. 

[Maritime Executive](https://maritime-executive.com/article/first-green-methanol-fueled-boxship-starts-maiden-voyage-for-maersk) reports that the departure of the 32,300 dwt vessel came just a day after OCI Fuels completed the first green methanol bunkering operation. The containership was fueled with OCI HyFuels ISCC certified green methanol and under arrangement working with Maersk, a supply of green methanol has been established all along the vessel’s route to Europe. Odfjell SE, is the transportation and storage partner, helping to set up the supply of green methanol in Ulsan for yesterday’s bunkering operation.

The *Laura Maersk* is 564 feet long with a 105-foot beam with a nominal capacity of 2,100 TEU including 400 reefer plugs. She was built with a MAN dual-fuel engine that was expected to give her a top speed of 17.4 knots. 

OCI reported the bunkering operation marked the start of the ship’s maiden voyage, which will see the ship bunkering in Singapore, Egypt, and Rotterdam en route to Copenhagen. Her AIS signal shows she is making about 9 knots on her way to Shanghai, China where she is due to arrive on July 19.

“The journey will be a catalyst for future green methanol bunkering and will see the ship re-fueled with OCI Hyfuels’ green methanol at key global ports, positioning OCI as the first commercial bunker operator of green methanol at a global scale,” said OCI Global.

[Green methanol](https://www.iberdrola.com/about-us/what-we-do/green-hydrogen/green-methanol) is methanol that is produced renewably and without polluting emissions, one of its variants being generated from green hydrogen. This chemical compound can be used as a low-carbon liquid fuel and is a promising alternative to fossil fuels in areas where decarbonisation is a major challenge, such as maritime transport.

Maersk has 24 methanol-fueled containerships on order and has been followed by other large carriers including COSCO, CMA CGM, and now Evergreen. Smaller feeder carriers including X-Press Feeders have also ordered methanol-fueled ships. More than 100 containerships capable of operating on methanol as their primary fuel are due to enter service over the next five years.
