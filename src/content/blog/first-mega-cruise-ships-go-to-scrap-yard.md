[Carnival Fantasy entering in Aliaga to be scrapped](https://youtu.be/I1a6772DuCs)

In the video, the [*Carnival Fantasy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_Fantasy) is being beached at the Aliaga scrapyard in Turkey.  Next to it are two other cruise ships, the [*Sovereign*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Sovereign) and the [*Monarch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Monarch), which had been operated by Pullmantur Cruises, a joint venture controlled by Royal Caribbean. The three ships waiting to be scrapped are among the first “mega” cruise ships, which had a huge impact on the cruise industry.

The *Sovereign* and the *Monarch* were originally the *Sovereign of the Seas* and the *Monarch of the Seas,* the first of a new generation of “mega” cruise ships built by Royal Caribbean. When the *Sovereign of the Seas* was launched in 1988, it was the largest cruise ship in the world, at 74,000 GT, more than twice as large as the next largest ship in the Royal Caribbean fleet. It featured a five-story internal atrium with glass elevators, a first in cruise ships.

The *Monarch of the Seas,* a near sister ship to the *Sovereign of the Seas,* was launched in 1991.  In 2007, *Monarch of the Seas* became the first major cruise liner in the world to be captained by a woman, Karin Stahre Janson.  

The third ship on the beach at Aliaga, the *Carnival Fantasy* was launched in 1990.  At just over 70,000 GT and featuring a multi-story atrium, the ship was built as a direct response to Royal Caribbean’s *Sovereign of the Seas*. Other cruise lines would follow suit and build ever-larger ships to compete with the new “mega” ships.

The more than 70,000 GRT ships triggered an “arms race” in cruise ship construction. Soon the Royal Caribbean’s *Sovereign of the Sea* class and Carnival’s *Fantasy* class ships were themselves out-classed by the newer and larger ships that they inspired. Today, the largest cruise ship in the world is Royal Caribbean’s *[Symphony of the Seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_of_the_Seas),* which at 228,081 GT, is three times larger than any of the three ships about to the scrapped in Turkey.
