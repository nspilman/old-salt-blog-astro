![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/01/armybasemarshells.jpg)Last Saturday, January 20, a series of massive storm-driven waves struck the island of Roi-Namur in the Marshall Islands causing considerable flooding and damage to the [US Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll](https://home.army.mil/kwajalein/) (USAG–KA).  

A [video circulating on social media](https://twitter.com/volcaholic1/status/1749554817431675230?s=20) showed water smashing into a dining facility at USAG–KA as a series of unexpected waves surged across the low-lying island.

The island of Roi-Namur is the second-largest island of the [Kwajalein Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwajalein_Atoll) in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The US Army facility supports the US Space and Missile Defense Command’s [Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site](https://www.smdc.army.mil/Portals/38/Documents/Publications/Fact_Sheets/RTS.pdf) (RTS). RTS serves as a space and missile defense test range for the Department of Defense.

“Multiple areas on the island are underwater,” according to an [Army statement](https://www.army.mil/article/273134/operation_roi_recovery_assesses_damages_to_kwajalein_atoll_infrastructure), which was posted and accompanied by an aerial photo taken on January 21 that shows extensive flooding on Roi-Namur.

The runway on the island, home to 120 personnel, needed to be cleared so recovery operations could begin, according to the statement from USAG-KT. Flooding from the waves damaged much of the unaccompanied personnel housing. The dining facility, Outrigger Bar and Grill, the chapel and the Tradewinds Theater were moderately to severely damaged. The automotive complex remains underwater.

“Operation Roi Recovery could take months to complete,” the Army said.

The report did not mention any damage to military infrastructure.

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/asia/rogue-waves-kwajalein-atoll-pacific-intl-hnk-ml/index.html) meteorologist Robert Shackelford said the video appeared to show a “rogue wave,” which the National Weather Service defines as “unusually large waves appearing in a set of smaller waves.”

The weather service says rogue waves are unpredictable, are at least twice the size of surrounding waves, and can come from directions other than the prevailing wind and wave patterns.

Shackelford said the effects of rogue waves are exacerbated by rising sea levels brought on by climate change.

> Whoahhh!!!! 🌊

> Roi-Namur Island was struck by several substantial waves on Saturday night. It was NOT a tsunami. The powerful waves, driven by cyclonic surges in the open sea, affected the island located in the northern part of the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.
