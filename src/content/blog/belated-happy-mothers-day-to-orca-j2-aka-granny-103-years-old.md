A belated happy Mother’s day to the [matriarch of the J pod, known as J2, but nicknamed “Granny,”](http://www.theprovince.com/news/matriarch+orca+Granny+still+going+strong/9828660/story.html) by orca researchers who is believed to be 103 years old this year, and still swimming strong. The J pod is a [southern resident group](http://www.orcaspirit.com/vancouver-island-marine-wildlife/vancouver-island-orcas-killer-whales/item/whales-of-southern-community) of orcas that inhabits the coastal waters from Haida Gwaii in British Columbia to Northern California for about eight months of the year. Remarkably, the centenarian “Granny” and the J Pod just traveled 800 miles in just under 8 days.

In the wild, male orcas live for around 30 years but often live for 50-60 years. Females typically live for around 50 years but as suggested by J2, Granny, can live much longer.

Granny, by the way, poses a problem for Sea World, which claims that orcas live about as long in captivity as in the wild. In the documentary “[Blackfish](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/07/seaworld-blackfish-blackstone-the-fight-over-a-documentary/),” [one SeaWorld employee states that orcas in captivity](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1311/02/se.02.html) live longer. “*They tend to live a lot longer in this environment because they have all the veterinary care.*” In fact, orcas live far shorter and less healthy lives in captivity. [Several scientific studies](http://books.google.com/books?id=XbyxI-d5idcC&pg=PA170#v=onepage&q&f=false) concluded that captive orcas die at three times the rate of orcas in the wild. [Of the 159 captive killer whales that have died](http://www.orcahome.de/lifeexpectancy.htm), close to 2/3 didn’t make it beyond 10 years in captivity. Only 30 orcas survived more than 20 years in captivity.
