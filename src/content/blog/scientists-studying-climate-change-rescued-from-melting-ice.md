A group of 16 Russian scientists, monitoring climate change in the Arctic, encountered more than they had planned on. They had to be rescued when the ice beneath their station began to crack due to unusually warm weather. The [Russian nuclear icebreaker *Yamal*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamal_\(icebreaker\)) reached the research station, off Canada, on Saturday, eight days after departing Murmansk.  The crew of the icebreaker is expected to collect the SP-40 research station’s remaining equipment within the next four or five days.  Thanks to Dave Shirlaw on the MARHST-L for pointing out the article.
