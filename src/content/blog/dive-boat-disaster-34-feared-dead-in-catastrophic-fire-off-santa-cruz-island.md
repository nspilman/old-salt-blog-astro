Thirty-four people are believed to have died in the fire. Five of six crew members escaped alive. So far, the Coast Guard has recovered 25 bodies from the hull of the wooden dive boat. Nine remain missing and are presumed dead. Most of the dead were asleep in a common bunk room below deck when the intense fire broke out.

A Mayday call reporting the fire was received at 3:15 AM, Monday morning.  The fire is started on the 75′ long wooden dive boat while it was anchored about 20 yards off Platts Harbor on Santa Cruz Island, officials said. Firefighters were attempting to put out the fire when the boat sank in 60-foot waters. The dive boat was on a three-day dive excursion.

Officials said the vessel was in full compliance with inspections and other regulations.

The passenger accommodation space was on the lower deck accessible by two narrow stairways to the galley and upper decks. There was also reported to be an emergency hatch at the other end of the berthing space.  The 33 passengers slept in two and three high bunk beds and were believed to be asleep when the fire broke out.
