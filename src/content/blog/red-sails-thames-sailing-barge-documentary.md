*Red Sails* is a documentary by [Michael Maloney](https://vimeo.com/user59176548) about the remarkable Thames sailing barges, which continued to ply their trade well into the 20th century before being replaced by diesel trucks. The documentary interviews bargemen about their lives aboard the sailing barges and also follows the rebuilding and the relaunching of the [Thames sailing barge Cambria](http://www.cambriatrust.org.uk/), which was the last British registered vessel to carry a commercial cargo under sail alone, retiring only in 1970.  Thanks to David Rye for contributing to this post.
