![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/hawaiianchieftan2.jpg)For several years now, the [Grays Harbor Historical Seaport](https://www.historicalseaport.org/)‘s tall ships, the replica brig [*Lady Washington*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Washington) and the square topsail ketch *[Hawaiian Chieftain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Chieftain),* have sailed the Pacific Coast offering educational and sail training programs. One highlight of these programs were the “battle-sails” where the two ships maneuvered to fire blanks at each other in mock combat. [We recently posted a video of a “battle-sail.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/01/grays-harbor-lady-washington-hawaiian-chieftain-columbia-river-battle-sail/)”

The “battle-sails,” at least those involving the *Hawaiian Chieftain,* appear to be coming to an end. Grays Harbor Historical Seaport (GHHS) has announced its intention to sell the *Hawaiian Chieftain* to focus on the operation of **Lady Washington.** The decision was precipitated by the discovery of significant problems with the steel in her hull and bowsprit last year by Coast Guard inspectors. 

“We have come to the difficult decision that *Hawaiian Chieftain*’s role within GHHS is coming to an end,” [Brandi Bednarik, executive director of GHHS, said in a news release.](https://www.chinookobserver.com/life/hawaiian-chieftain-s-passenger-vessel-days-are-over/article_9e7c54cc-541f-11ea-a193-b747f47d92df.html)

“*Hawaiian Chieftain* has been an important part of our operations for nearly three decades, so this was a difficult decision to make. When the weather allows, we intend to bring her back to Aberdeen where she can be hauled out until a new owner is found,” the release said.

“We really need to invest that money into *Lady Washington*. She’s our flagship and the heart of our organization. And then we’re committed to developing the Seaport Landing which is part of our original charter and why the city invested in us in the first place,” Bednarik said.
