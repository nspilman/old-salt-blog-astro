![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/admirealterry.jpg)Congratulations to ex-Commodore [Judith Helen “Jude” Terry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Terry), who was appointed today the first female admiral in the history of the British Royal Navy.  Rear Admiral Terry, 48, with 25 years’ service around the globe and at home in the UK, will serve as Director of People and Training and Naval Secretary. 

From the [RN announcement](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2022/january/17/20220117-royal-navys-first-but-definitely-not-last-female-admiral-takes-command):

That makes the rear admiral responsible not only for more than 40,000 regular and reservist sailors and Royal Marines, but also the Royal Fleet Auxiliary – who operate the Navy’s crucial support ships – plus civil servants and contractors, all part of the gigantic jigsaw which allows the Royal Navy to operate around the globe 24/7/365.

Women have served in the Royal Navy since the Wrens in World War 1 and have been going to sea since 1990. Today there is no position or branch of the Service not open to women.

She says the fact that she is a woman is irrelevant to her post and rank – simply that “someone has to be first” and she most definitely will not be the last; there are currently four female commodores (the next rank down) and 20 female captains.

Passionate about diversity, inclusivity, equality and social mobility, she believes talent, ability and dedication are the only factors determining success: background, education and patronage count for nothing, what you personally bring to the Royal Navy is everything.

“The world has changed in terms of what people want from life and careers, whatever their gender, and the Navy needs to work to modernise our organisation to support this change – a diverse and inclusive workforce is a better place for all but is also proven to deliver better outcomes,” Admiral Terry said.

First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Ben Key says Admiral Terry is “a great example of all the amazing women serving today – and a role model for all who serve and those who follow.”

She took the reins of her department from her predecessor Rear Admiral Phil Hally following a ceremony aboard HMS Victory in Portsmouth, continuing and building upon many of the changes he has introduced under the Royal Navy’s sweeping Transformation programme to forge a force to rise to the challenges – social, technological, ecological, economic and military – in the world of today and tomorrow.
