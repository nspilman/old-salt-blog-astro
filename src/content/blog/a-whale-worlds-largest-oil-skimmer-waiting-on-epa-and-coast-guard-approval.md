**Update:  According to her AIS (Automatic Identification System) the** ***A Whale*** **is now off Louisiana.  Thanks to Buck for pointing it out.** [**Click here to see per position on the chart.**](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/default.aspx?oldmmsi=636014465&zoom=10&olddate=6/30/2010%2012:38:26%20PM)

A Taiwanese-owned, Liberian-flagged tanker,  the *[A Whale](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=636014465)*, has been modified for skimming up to 500,000 barrels of oil-contaminated water a day.   To put this in context, if the system works as intended, it could skim in less than two days an amount of oil equal to all the oil skimmed in the past 70 days of the ongoing *Deepwater Horizon* spill.   The *A Whale* is designed to operate offshore where most skimmers have difficulty operating.   It is currently in Norfolk, VA awaiting approval of separate waivers from the Coast Guard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to allow it to begin testing.    Because the *A Whale* would be operating well offshore it is not believed to require a Jones Act Waiver.
