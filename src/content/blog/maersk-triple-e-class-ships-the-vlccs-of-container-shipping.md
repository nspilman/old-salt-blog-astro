In the late 60s, the first VLCCs (Very Large Crude Carrier) were initially referred to as [Malaccamax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaccamax) tankers, as they were the largest tankers that could navigate through the Straits of Malacca.  Maersk Line has recently ordered ten Malaccamax container ships, each capable of carrying 18,000 containers.  These ships will be the world’s largest by size, if not necessarily by deadweight.    They are dubbed the [“Triple E” Class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maersk_Triple_E_class), referring to “”Economies of scale, Energy efficiency and Environmentally improved.”  The ships will be built by Daewoo Shipbuilding at a cost of around $1.9 billion and the first delivery is expected in 2014.   Maersk also has the option of ordering ten more ships under the contract.
