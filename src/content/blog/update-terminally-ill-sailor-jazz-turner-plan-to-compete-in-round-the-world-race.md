![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jazz2.jpg)We recently posted about [Jazz Turner](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2025/07/terminally-ill-sailor-jazz-turner-becomes-the-first-disabled-person-to-sail-solo-around-uk/), a terminally ill sailor, who became the first disabled person to circumnavigate the British Isles non-stop and unassisted. Now, the 27-year-old engineer, a full-time wheelchair user, has a new goal.  She has set her sights on becoming the first disabled female sailor to complete a solo global race. She hopes to sail in the [Royal Western Yacht Club’s around-the-world WorldStar challenge](https://rwyc.org/race/worldstar-2026/).

The 27-year-old told BBC Radio Sussex that she had started planning the challenge three hours after completing the 2,070 mile (3,331km) trip around the British Isles. Turner said the challenge will require sourcing the right boat and sponsorship. “I’ve always been drawn to challenges that push me to my edge. I face many a ‘no’ in my life, but I do my best to turn them into ‘yes’,” she said. “The right partnership could turn this vision into reality.”

Turner lives with [Ehlers-Danlos Syndrom](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362125)e, a debilitating genetic condition that affects connective tissue. Her doctors have told her that her condition is now terminal, due to complications.

“As my condition has progressed, the one thing I made sure of was that I never stopped sailing,” she said.

Turner hopes to race in the new around the World yachting event, the Woeldstar.  This event is open to all solo and double-handed boats between 35ft and 60ft that has completed a 2000-mile qualification passage in the allotted timeframe. The course is to start from Plymouth Sound National Marine Park, around the 3 Great Capes to Port and return to Plymouth Sound for the finish.

The race is due to begin in September next year.
