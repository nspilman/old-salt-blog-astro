![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/08/FLIP.jpg)After 61 years of service, the one of its kind research vessel [**FL**oating **I**nstrument *P*latform, known as FLIP](https://ocean.si.edu/human-connections/exploration/flip-floating-instrument-platform), has been retired and sent to a scrapyard.  I distinctly recall being absolutely fascinated by this engineering marvel when it was almost brand new. As not quite a teenager, I remember being taken by both the simplicity and wonderful weirdness of the 355-foot-long research platform with a generally ship-shaped bow and a largely cylindrical hull. 

The vessel would be towed to deep water, where the ballast tanks in the stern would be filled with seawater and the craft would literally “flip” from horizontal to vertical. With 300 feet of the hull floating upright underwater, the research platform would float serenely in deep water, literally unmoved by ocean swells. (If this description doesn’t make any sense to you, check out the video below of the FLIP flipping.”

Launched on June 22, 1962, FLIP was the brainchild of two Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientists, Fred Fisher, and Fred Spiess, as an exceptionally stable platform for research related to a U.S. Navy submarine weapons program.  Over its long career, FLIP was owned by the U.S. Office of Naval Research (ONR) and operated by Scripps.

The design is essentially a massive 355-foot-long spar buoy with ballast tanks and space for research equipment and instrumentation, as well as accommodation spaces for scientists and engineers.

[FLIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP_FLIP) was used to study oceanic wave height, acoustic signals, water temperature and density, and for the collection of meteorological data. Because of the potential interference with the acoustic instruments, FLIP had no means of propulsion. It was towed to open water, where it drifted freely or was anchored.

FLIP was 700 gross tons and carried a crew of five, plus up to eleven scientists. It was capable of operating independently during month-long missions without resupply. It could be operated around the world, although it normally operated off the West Coast of the United States from a home base at Scripps’ Nimitz Marine Facility in San Diego, California.

The ship had specially designed interiors: some fixtures, such as the toilet seats, could flip 90°, and the shower heads are curved 90°. There were overhead lights on the surfaces that are the ceilings in both the towing (horizontal) and flipped orientations.
