![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/07/terhart.jpg)Canadian Bert terHart recently completed a 267-day solo, non-stop circumnavigation of the world via the five capes on his 43′ sailboat using only traditional celestial navigation. He is the first North American to circle the globe solo and non-stop using only a sextant, a chronometer, an almanac, pen, paper, and charts with which to navigate.

While not using global positioning satellites to navigate, he did bring along an email equipped satellite phone and posted to a [blog](https://www.sailblogs.com/member/seaburban/) and an [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/svseaburban/?utm_source=ig_embed). In addition to maintaining contact with friends and family,  he was also followed online by about 2,000 children from Kenya to New Zealand to New York from their classrooms.

“I wanted to engage kids in something that really would stretch their imagination,” he said.

When he departed Victoria, British Columbia, there was no pandemic. He said that hearing about the spread of the virus around the world from the isolation of his boat was surreal.

The [Global News](https://globalnews.ca/news/7193683/bc-solo-sailor-around-the-world-traditional-methods/) quotes terHart saying, “It was really hard because there’s nothing you can do.”

“You’re not at risk in any way, of course — I’m at risk of the elements and the weather, but I’m prepared for all that … you’re literally a thousand miles away from anyone, even if I wanted to help, it would take a month to get there.”

On his return to British Columbia, Canadian authorities agreed to waive the mandatory two-week quarantine period for arriving visitors on the basis that a solo-circumnavigation was sufficient self-isolation to prevent the spread of the virus.
