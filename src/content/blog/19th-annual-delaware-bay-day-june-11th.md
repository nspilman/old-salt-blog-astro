![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/baydaykid.jpg)The good folks at the [Bayshore Discovery Project](http://www.ajmeerwald.org/) say that “Delaware ‘Bay Day’ is the largest FREE festival in the tri-state region.”   I have no way of knowing whether that is literally true, but nevertheless it sounds like great fun.   ‘Bay Day’ will commence tomorrow, Saturday June 11th, in the historic New Jersey fishing villages of Bivalve and Port Norris, beginning with a parade in Port Norris at 11 AM and finishing up with the NJ Championship Oyster Shucking Contest, at 6PM.  In between there will be lots of music, food, games and activities for all ages.
