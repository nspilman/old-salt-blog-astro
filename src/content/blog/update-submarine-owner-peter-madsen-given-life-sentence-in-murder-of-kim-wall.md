![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/08/wallnautiuls.jpg)We have been following the [grim saga of the murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/10/grim-discovery-in-kim-wall-murder/) since last August.  Ms. Wall disappeared after going on a trip in Copenhagen harbor onboard Peter Madsen’s private submarine, [UC3 *Nautulis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC3_Nautilus), as part of an interview. The submarine sank under mysterious circumstances and Ms. Wall disappeared. Mr. Madsen was rescued and subsequently charged with murder. Ms. Wall’s dismembered torso washed onto a nearby beach eleven days later.

A court in Copenhagen has found Mr. Madsen guilty of premeditated killing — equivalent to murder — in the death of Ms. Wall and has sentenced Madsen to life in prison.

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/world/europe/peter-madsen-kim-wall-convicted.html) reports: *“Given all of the evidence, the court has concluded that Madsen is guilty of murdering Kim Wall,” the presiding judge, Anette Burko said.*

*She noted the evidence of premeditation in the crimes, including Mr. Madsen’s history of researching murder and dismemberment, and the fact that he brought onto the submarine the tools used to subdue and kill Ms. Wall. “The court finds that the evidence showed Madsen tied up Kim Wall,” she said.*

Madsen’s attorney says that they will appeal the verdict.
