There are an estimated two million protesters in the streets on Cairo today; most rail, trucking and buses are shut down across Egypt, yet  the [Suez Canal, which can represent up 8 percent of global seaborne trade, remains open](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-31/suez-canal-ship-traffic-normal-without-delays-official-says.html) and in operation.  [Military escorts for protection through the pirate-prone Gulf of Aden are unavailable](http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL3E7CV08K20110131) and crew repatriation and purchase of provisions have not been possible for some ships.   [Troops have been deployed to protect the SuMed pipeline](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-01/egypt-s-military-deploys-along-sumed-oil-pipeline-official-says.html) transporting crude alongside the Suez Canal.

Larger concerns are being expressed over the closure or disruption in Egyptian ports.  [A.P. Moller-Maersk has suspended its Egypt port terminal operations](http://af.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFJOE70U0AH20110131) and closed its shipping offices and [South Korea’s Hanjin Shipping has re-routed some of its container vessels](http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL3E7D10G720110201) to avoid either shut-downs or disruption in Port Said and Alexandria.   There are [concerns of shortages](http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110131-715662.html) if port operations do not resume shortly.
