On Sunday, the 6535 dwt  South Korean tanker, *Doola No. 3*, exploded in the Yellow Sea near the port of Incheon.  Of the crew of 16, 5 are confirmed dead while 6 are missing.  The explosion ripped the tanker in half.  The ship was traveling in ballast after discharging a cargo of gasoline.  The Doola No. 3 typically transports diesel fuel.  The cause is still undermined but an ignition of gasoline fumes is suspected to have caused the explosion.
