![sya2b](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sya2b.jpg)Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko’s new sail-assisted motor-yacht, named simply, [Sailing Yacht *A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_\(sailing_yacht\)), is [undergoing sea trials](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3840990/330m-superyacht-owned-Russian-billionaire-sails-test.html). The $450 million yacht has a number of superlatives attached to it. At 12,700 tonnes, it is the largest sailing yacht in the world by gross tonnage. At 469 feet, she is the longest sailing yacht in existence. Its 300 foot tall carbon fiber masts are the largest composite freestanding structures in the world. And while not a superlative exactly, the yacht — a slab sided, eight decked, angular monstrosity — does qualify as the ugliest sailing vessel in the world.

Royal Clipper

While Sailing Yacht *A* may be the largest sailing yacht by gross tonnage, she is not the largest sailing ship in service by sail area. Her 40,330 sq ft three masted schooner rig is nothing to scoff at. Indeed, it is 8,000 sq ft larger than the rig on the tea clipper [*Cutty Sark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark).  Nevertheless, Sailing Yacht *A* does not compare to the 56,000 sq ft of sail set by the five masted square rigged cruise ship *[Royal Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Clipper)* operated by [Star Clippers](http://www.starclippers.com/en/).  Even the century old windjammer [*Peking*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_\(ship\)), bound for restoration in Hamburg in the Spring, had more sail area at 44,132 sq ft.  In addition to having more sail area, *Royal Clipper* and *Peking* are both beautiful ships, something that cannot be said of *A*.

Now that Melnichenko has his new toy, he has put his previous yacht, a [390 foot motor-yacht also named](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3553474/Andrey-Melnichenko-puts-Motor-Yacht-sale-buying-Sailing-Yacht-A.html) *A,* on the market for around $300 million.
