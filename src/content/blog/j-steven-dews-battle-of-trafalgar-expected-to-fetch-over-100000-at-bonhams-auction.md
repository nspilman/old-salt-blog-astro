![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/trafdews1.jpg)The old saying goes that success is the best revenge.  [John Stevens Dews](http://www.artmarine.co.uk/dews.aspx) failed his ‘A’ level art. (For the non-British, including myself, the ‘A’ level is a public examination in a subject taken for the General Certificate of Education (GCE), usually at the age of 17-18.)   Perhaps the examiners should be examined. Dews, who was told as a youth that fame usually comes only after an artist has died, is now one of Britain’s most sought-after living marine artists.  Dews painting, “*The Battle of Trafalgar – H.M.S. Victory breaking the enemy line and raking the stern of the French flagship as she goes through*” is the star of the [September 26th Marine auction at Bonhams](http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19925/lot/154/?search_query=1&division=None&passages=True&earliest_first=False&country=None&past_sales=future&back_to_year=2003&sale_no=None&top_level_department=None&department=None&query=dews&create_facets=True&value_data_currency=GBP) in London.  The painting is expected to fetch between £100,000 – 150,000, or €130,000 – 190,000 or US$ 160,000 – 240,000.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://alaricbond.com/) for passing along the news.
