When Diana Nyad was stopped by repeated jellyfish stings in her most recent attempt to swim between Cuba and Florida, it brought to mind two articles, one about the discovery of the [“immortal jellyfish”](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/01/090130-immortal-jellyfish-swarm.html) and another which raised the question whether the [world’s oceans will become dominated by jellyfish](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/specialsections/40th-anniversary/Jellyfish-The-Next-Kings-of-the-Sea.html).

As global warming and pollution degrade the oceans are we being faced by a jellyfish apocalypse? Consider – on the night of December 10, 1999, 40 million people, abruptly lost power on the Philippine island of Luzon, home to the capital, Manila. Was it a terrorist attack? A coup? No, it was masses of jellyfish blocking cooling lines of a local power plant. An editorial in the Philippine Star noted, “*Here we are at the dawn of a new millennium, in the age of cyberspace, and we are at the mercy of jellyfish.”*

*A decade later, the predicament seems only to have worsened. All around the world, jellyfish are behaving badly—reproducing in astonishing numbers and congregating where they’ve supposedly never been seen before. Jellyfish have halted seafloor diamond mining off the coast of Namibia by gumming up sediment-removal systems. Jellies scarf so much food in the Caspian Sea they’re contributing to the commercial extinction of beluga sturgeon—the source of fine caviar. In 2007, mauve stinger jellyfish stung and asphyxiated more than 100,000 farmed salmon off the coast of Ireland as aquaculturists on a boat watched in horror. The jelly swarm reportedly was 35 feet deep and covered ten square miles.*

*Nightmarish accounts of “[Jellyfish Gone Wild](http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/jellyfish/index.jsp),” as a 2008 National Science Foundation report called the phenomenon, stretch from the fjords of Norway to the resorts of Thailand. By clogging cooling equipment, jellies have shut down nuclear power plants in several countries; they partially disabled the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan four years ago. In 2005, jellies struck the Philippines again, this time incapacitating 127 police officers who had waded chest-deep in seawater during a counterterrorism exercise, apparently oblivious to the more imminent threat. (Dozens were hospitalized.) This past fall, a ten-ton fishing trawler off the coast of Japan capsized and sank while hauling in a netful of 450-pound Nomura’s jellies.*

**The Immortal Jellyfish**

A year and a half ago, scientists made a remarkable discovery – one species of jellyfish has the potential to become effectively immortal.   The tiny *Turritopsis dohrnii* jellyfish can in times of stress can transform itself to a younger state, a polyp colony capable of which can spawn hundreds of genetically identical copies of the original adult jellyfish.  It can effectively reach maturity and then age backwards.

[“Immortal” Jellyfish Swarm World’s Oceans](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/01/090130-immortal-jellyfish-swarm.html)

*A potentially “immortal” jellyfish species that can age backward—the Benjamin Button of the deep—is silently invading the world’s oceans, swarm by swarm, a recent study says.*

*Turritopsis typically reproduces the old-fashioned way, by the meeting of free-floating sperm and eggs. And most of the time they die the old-fashioned way too.* 

*But when starvation, physical damage, or other crises arise, “instead of sure death, \[Turritopsis\] transforms all of its existing cells into a younger state,” said study author Maria Pia Miglietta, a researcher at Pennsylvania State University.*
