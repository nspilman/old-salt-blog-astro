![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/dehef.jpg)In February, we posted [Billionaire Bezos’ Really Big Boat and the Rotterdam Railroad Bridge](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/02/billionaire-bezos-really-big-boat-and-the-rotterdam-railroad-bridge/) about reports that Rotterdam would dismantle the center span of a historic railroad bridge to allow the 417-foot-long, three-masted sailing yacht built for billionaire Jeff Bezos to access the sea. The fully rigged superyacht has too great an air-draft to safely fit beneath the Koningshaven Bridge, which has a clearance of 131 feet over the Nieuwe Maas River.

Now, [Trouw](https://www.trouw.nl/binnenland/rotterdamse-brug-toch-niet-ontmanteld-na-bedreigingen-tegen-bouwer-van-superjacht-jeff-bezos~b2b2504c/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dutchnews.nl%2Fnews%2F2022%2F06%2Frotterdam-bridge-wont-be-demolished-for-jeff-bezos-yacht-trouw%2F%3Fte%3D1%26nl%3Ddealbook%26emc%3Dedit_dk_20220701) is reporting that the Dutch shipbuilder [Oceanco](https://www.oceancoyacht.com/) has informed the municipality of Rotterdam that it is canceling the plans to dismantle the bridge. The yard said that it was shocked by the social unrest over the potential dismantling and that shipyard employees feel threatened and the company fears vandalism. 

Previously, thousands of Rotterdammers threatened to throw eggs at Bezos’ superyacht during a possible passage.

The Koningshavenbrug bridge, known to Rotterdammers as [De Hef](https://www.bridgeinfo.net/bridge/index.php?ID=27), was renovated in 2017 and the council pledged at the time it would never be dismantled again.

Presumably, the superyacht will make the passage down the river with its masts unstepped. The three-masted vessel is the largest sailing yacht ever built in the Netherlands.
