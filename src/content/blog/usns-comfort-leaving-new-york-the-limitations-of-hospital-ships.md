![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/03/usnscomfortarrivesnyc.jpg)US military doctors, nurses, and technicians are among the best in the world, able to step in and to do their jobs under a range of challenging and demanding conditions. Fortunately, over 500 professionals from the Army, Navy, and Air Force are [currently working alongside civilian medical professionals](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/08/politics/military-doctor-surge-nyc/index.html) in New York City’s still overstressed hospitals. The military doctors and nurses are getting glowing reviews from all concerned. 

The hospital ship USNS *Comfort* will soon be leaving New York harbor to return to its base in Virginia. Reviews of the hospital ship’s performance have been mixed at best.

Despite arriving with considerable fanfare, on March 30th, near the peak of the hospital crisis, the hospital ship with notionally 1,000 beds, when configured as a field hospital, [treated only 179 patients](https://www.businessinsider.com/usns-comfort-leaving-nyc-few-coronavirus-patients-three-weeks-2020-4) during its three-week stay. The plan was to provide treatment for non-COVID-19 patients in order to take the burden of local hospitals. 

What happened? Why did the ship with close to 1,200 medical personnel treat so few patients? Part of the answer appears to be related to a tangle of military protocols and bureaucratic requirements which prevented the hospital ships from accepting many patients at all. In the days after the arrival of the USNS *Comfort* in New York City, it accepted [only 20 patients](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-usns-comfort.html). Likewise, its sistership the USNS *Mercy*, deployed a week before to Los Angelos, had only admitted 15 patients. 

In some respects, this is nothing new. When the *Comfort* was deployed to assist the people of Puerto Rico following Hurrican Maria, the ship admitted an [average of only six patients a day, or 290 in total](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-hospital-ship.html) during an almost two-month stay. An additional 1,625 people were treated aboard the ship as outpatients.  While in New York, the *Comfort* averaged just over seven patients per day.

As reported by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-usns-comfort.html): *On top of its strict rules preventing people infected with the virus from coming on board, the Navy is also refusing to treat a host of other conditions. Guidelines disseminated to hospitals included a list of 49 medical conditions that would exclude a patient from admittance to the ship.*

*Ambulances cannot take patients directly to the Comfort; they must first deliver patients to a city hospital for a lengthy evaluation — including a test for the virus — and then pick them up again for transport to the ship.*

As the Navy and New York City hospitals were working their way through an attempt at streamlining the protocols, [five patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were accidentally transferred](https://news.usni.org/2020/04/03/rules-eased-on-patient-transfers-to-usns-comfort-more-navy-personnel-to-join-domestic-covid-19-support) to the *Comfort*.  Shortly thereafter it was decided to allow COVID-19 patients to be treated on the hospital ship, which was quickly reconfigured from 1,000 to 500 beds to allow for treating the virus. 

Ten days after the ship arrived, as New York City hospitals were overwhelmed, the number of patients on the *Comfort* rose to only [62, including 26 in intensive care.](https://nypost.com/2020/04/10/usns-comfort-javits-center-still-largely-empty-of-nyc-coronavirus-patients/)  

The hospital ships were sources of the virus as well. Shortly after arriving in New York harbor, a [crew member on the USNS *Comfort* tested positive for the virus.](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2020/04/07/first-case-of-coronavirus-confirmed-among-crew-of-hospital-ship-comfort/) On the West Coast, seven crew members aboard the USNS *Mercy* hospital ship, docked at the Port of Los Angeles, tested positive for coronavirus. The Navy subsequently removed [116 medical staff members](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/navy-removes-126-hospital-ship-virus-infects-70146712) from the ship.
