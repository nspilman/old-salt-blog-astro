![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/03/stadtshiptunnel.jpg)An update to [a post from 2017](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/04/norway-build-worlds-first-ship-tunnel/): Norway’s [Stad Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stad_\(peninsula\)) divides the Norwegian Sea to the north and the North Sea to the south. The seas, winds, currents, and weather are extremely dangerous for any ship attempting to round the peninsula. Now, Norway intends to bore through the rocky shores to cut a passageway to create a short-cut for ocean-going ships. The [tunnel, the world’s  first for ocean-going ships,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/move-over-suez-hello-stad-norway-to-build-worlds-first-tunnel-for-ships) will be 1,700 meters long by 37 meters high and 26.5 meters wide. The tunnel is expected to cost at least [2.7bn kroner ($325m)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2021/03/05/norways-325-million-ship-tunnel-gets-go-ahead/?sh=469fcbcd56fe). A tunnel through the Stadt peninsula was first proposed in 1870.

After years of planning, the [Norwegian Coastal Administration has confirmed](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/norway-moves-ahead-with-world-s-first-ship-tunnel) that it has received the go-ahead to start working on the Stad Ship Tunnel.

The project is estimated to take around 3-4 years for construction, with the Norwegian Coastal Administration (Kystverket) moving forward with an investment of $325 million from start-up funds.  “If everything goes according to plan, the world’s first full-scale ship tunnel will be completed in 2025/2026,” says Terje Andreassen, the current project manager for the tunnel.
