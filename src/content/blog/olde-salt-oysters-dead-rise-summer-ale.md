![ale&oysters](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/aleoysters.jpg)I am currently in the Northern Neck of of Virginia, where I will soon sit down with a boatyard to hear the latest estimated launch date for my Albin Nimbus 42, *Arcturus*.  As I left the boat with the yard last September and had discussed a May launch, which has now slipped to August, I will admit to being neither happy nor hopeful. Nevertheless, I do feel better about the world after having an ale and oysters at [Merroir](https://www.rroysters.com/restaurants/merroir) last night, a restaurant described as a “tasting room,” owned by the [Rappahannock Oyster Company](https://www.rroysters.com), which features oysters raised in their local oyster beds.  [Merroir, by the way, is defined](http://blogs.evergreen.edu/terroir-oyster13/definition-of-merroir/) as “how environmental and external factors influence the flavor and taste of seafood, such as shellfish. These factors influence the flavor profile and taste as well as the size and quality of meat in the shellfish.”

On this visit, I didn’t order just any ale and oysters. I had Flying Dog’s [Dead Rise Summer Ale](http://flyingdogbrewery.com/?beers=dead-rise), named in honor of the [Chesapeake deadrise workboats](http://www.marinersmuseum.org/sites/micro/cbhf/waterman/wat006.html), developed first in the 1880s and still in use on the bay today. And for the oysters, Merroir offered three choices —  [Rappahannock River, Stingray, and Olde Salt oysters](https://www.rroysters.com/oysters). Guess which one I chose? Yup, I chose the [Olde Salt](http://www.oysterguide.com/maps/chesapeake/olde-salt/), which were delicious. The Olde Salts are the Rappahannock Oyster Company take on the famed [Chincoteague Salts](http://www.oysterguide.com/maps/chesapeake/chincoteague/) from the bay of the same name.

So yes, while I would much rather be out sailing my boat than listening to a boat yard technician explain why it is still on the hard, oysters and ale make it all more bearable.
