The Blobfish

An intriguing if slightly disturbing article and photo from the LA Times:

[Fear the blobfish](http://www.latimes.com/ct-met-kass-0217-20100217,0,7154335.column)

*As scary as the jumping Asian carp may be, there’s something even scarier  –  the blobfish.*

*As you can see from the accompanying photograph, the cunning blobfish (Psychrolutes marcidus) is the most terrifying fish in the world.  And if you’re not afraid of it yet, you should be, because there’s always something lurking out there that can get you.*  
  
*Its hideously deformed body is quite boneless, a gelatinous orb hovering in the deep, covered in slime and mucus. But there’s something even worse. Its face.*

*Most fish don’t really have faces. You’ve heard people refer to “fish eyes” or “fish lips,” or they say, “Oh, shut up, you old fish face.”   But the blobfish actually has a face. Not a fish face, but a human face, complete with lips and a big, bulbous nose.*

*A blobfish looks like some fat, drunken judge and may be highly intelligent. And therefore quite dangerous.*
