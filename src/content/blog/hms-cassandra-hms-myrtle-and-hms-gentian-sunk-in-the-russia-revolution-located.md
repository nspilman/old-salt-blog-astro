HMS Cassandra

[Ninety years on, locations of Royal Navy warships sunk in Russian Revolution are found](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1305505/Royal-Navy-warships-sunk-Russian-Revolution-found.html)

*The wrecks of three British warships sunk more than 90 years ago – seeking to prevent the Bolshevik Revolution from spreading West – have been located in the Baltic Sea by the Estonian Navy.*

*HMS Cassandra, HMS Myrtle and HMS Gentian were lost as they fought to keep Estonia out of the hands of Vladimir Lenin after his seizure of power in Russia.*

*‘We are confident that these are the British ships in question which were lost during the War of Independence,’ announced the Estonian Navy’s chief of staff Commander Ivo Vark.*

*Almost a century later, the role of the Royal Navy is regarded as heroic by Estonians, and seen as a key factor in enabling the country to enjoy two decades of independence before being overrun by both Hitler and Stalin in the Second World War.*

*A total of 19 crew died in when the three vessels went down between December 1918 and July 1919. The lost Royal Navy sailors are now expected to be posthumously honoured by Estonia for their role in keeping the country free between the two world wars in the 20th century.*

*The warships – sunk after hitting mines – were found in a special operation by the Estonian minehunter Ugani off the island of Saaremaa. They lie at a depth of 60 to 100 metres.*
