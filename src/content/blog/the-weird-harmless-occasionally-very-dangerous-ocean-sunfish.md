![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sunfish.jpg)[Ocean sunfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_sunfish) are weird. One scientist who specializes in the fish described them as “[looking like a mistake](https://youtu.be/6jCuoohMARY).”  They are the heaviest bony fish in the ocean, weighing between 545–2,205 lb.

They look like a flattened silver disk. In English, they are called sunfish because they can often be found near the surface apparently sunbathing. Their Latin name is mola, meaning millstone for their heavy disk-like shape. They are also called moon-fish for the same reason. In German, they are called Schwimmender Kopf, or “swimming head” as some think they look like a fish head with fins.

Lacking a true tail, they swim by waving their ventral and dorsal fins. With their fins extended, they are frequently as tall as they are long. They also have no swim bladder to control buoyancy so they often float near the surface. Their dorsal fin protruding from the water can be mistaken for a shark fin.  

Sunfish live in tropical to temperate waters around the globe. Around Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, from mid-August to December they are known to [strand themselves on beaches](https://www.capecodtimes.com/news/20191101/cape-sees-sharp-rise-in-ocean-sunfish-strandings). Typically there are around 60 sunfish strandings.  Last year was particularly bad as the number rose to 130.

In October, a sunfish appeared in Wareham, Mass, swimming on its side, alarming local residents. Some thought the fish was sick. Some mistook it for a shark. The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/us/sunfish-wareham-police.html?searchResultPosition=1) reports that the calls about it had become so voluminous, however, that the Wareham Department of Natural Resources was compelled to issue a plea on Facebook. The fish was swimming, it said, adding: “It is not stranded or suffering. The sunfish is FINE.”

It added, “PLEASE STOP CALLING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIS SUNFISH!!”

The sunfish is often said to be harmless to humans. The same cannot be said of humans on sailboats. The problem is that fish weighing upwards of a ton floating near the surface can do considerable damage to a sailboat underway. 

In the [Sydney-Hobart Race](https://www.sail-world.com/Australia/Sydney-Hobart-Will-it-be-Supermaxi-or-Sunfish/-64679?source=google), high sped collisions with sunfish have become disturbingly common, usually resulting in rudder or keel damage. Collisions have been reported between sunfish and racing yachts in the race in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2014, and 2018. In 2005, the maxi *Wild Oats* collided three times during the race with sunfish, suffering rudder damage. In 2018, the Far 55 [*Hollywood Boulevard* sank](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/yacht-crew-returning-from-sydney-to-hobart-winched-to-safety-20180114-h0i4fd.html) after hitting a sunfish.
