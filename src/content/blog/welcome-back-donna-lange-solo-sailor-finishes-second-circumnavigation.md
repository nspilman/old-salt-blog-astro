![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/donnalange.jpg)A few days ago, Donna Lange returned home to Narragansett Bay after completing her second solo circumnavigation on *Inspired Insanity,* her Southern Cross 28.  An event was held in her honor at the Herreshoff Museum in Bristol, RI for family and friends to welcome her home. [Lange had set off from Bristol on July 31, 2105](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/07/bon-voyage-donna-lange-inspired-insanity-on-second-solo-circumnativation/) in an attempt to sail single-handed non-stop around the world. As she neared Cape Horn, however, her boat suffered rigging damage and Lange decided to divert to the Panama Canal for repairs.
