On Thursday, South African [Chris Bertish](http://www.thesupcrossing.com/) paddled his ocean-going stand-up paddleboard into Antiqua’s English Harbor becoming [the first person to cross the Atlantic by stand-up paddleboard.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/sports/chris-bertish-paddleboard-atlantic-ocean.html?_r=0) He left Agadir, Morocco, 93 days ago, on the epic 4,050-mile voyage.  Bertish was wholly unassisted and unsupported during the trip.  He averaged 44 miles a day — paddling mostly at night to avoid exposure to the sun — and alternated between resting and paddling every two or three hours. Bertish also set a [new world record](http://www.supthemag.com/news/chris-bertish-sets-new-world-record-2/#FgFjXgzfpPeFyorL.97) for paddling a 24-hour solo open ocean distance of 71.96 miles.
