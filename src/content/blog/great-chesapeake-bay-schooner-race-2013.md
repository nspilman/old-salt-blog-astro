The Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race (GCBSR) was founded to promote public awareness of the Chesapeake Bay’s maritime heritage and encourage the preservation and improvement of the Chesapeake’s natural resources. We accomplish this goal in part by donating the proceeds of the race to the [Chesapeake Bay Foundation](http://www.cbf.org/ "Chesapeake Bay Foundation"), an organization working to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay. To date, $157,624 has been donated to support children’s education programs of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
