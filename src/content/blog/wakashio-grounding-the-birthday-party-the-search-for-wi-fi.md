![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/brokenbulker.jpg)How does a modern ship with radar and GPS manage to run hard aground on a well-marked reef?  In the case of the Capesize bulker [*Wakashio* that ran aground on the reef at Pointe-d’Esny off Mauritius](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/08/capesize-bulker-mv-wakashio-aground-on-mauritius-reef-may-break-up/) on the evening of July 25, the answer appears to be a birthday party and an attempt to pick up a wifi signal. 

[L’Express.mu](https://www.lexpress.mu/article/381284/membres-dequipage-confirment-celebration-dun-anniversaire-bord-vraquier) reports that investigators from Mauritius have learned from interviews with the ship’s crew that just before the grounding there was a birthday party for one of the ship’s crew. Also, the ship’s course was changed to bring it closer to the island in an attempt to pick up a wifi signal. 

The *Wakashio* grounded on a reef near a UNESCO protected site and has since spilled over 1,000 tons of heavy fuel oil. [Splash247.com](https://splash247.com/birthday-party-and-quest-for-wifi-revealed-in-lead-up-to-wakashio-grounding-off-mauritius/) reports that local authorities had been trying in vain to contact the ship ahead of the accident to warn it was on the wrong course, but that the crew missed the call because they were celebrating the birthday.

The wrecked ship is on the verge of [breaking up](https://splash247.com/stricken-bulk-carrier-off-mauritius-tipped-to-break-up-in-the-coming-hours/) after creating the republic’s greatest ecological disaster.
