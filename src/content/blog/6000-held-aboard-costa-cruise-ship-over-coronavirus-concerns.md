![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/costasmerleda.jpg)**UPDATE:** The illness which sickened a passenger was determined not to be the coronavirus and the 6,000 passengers and crew were allowed to disembark from the *Costa Smeralda*. Two cases of the coronavirus, not related to the cruise ship, were diagnosed in Rome, however.

USA Today is reporting that an estimated 6,000 passengers and crew are being held onboard the [*Costa Smeralda*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Smeralda_\(ship\)) cruise ship while medical teams run diagnostic tests for the Wuhan [coronavirus](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/01/29/coronavirus-what-are-symptoms-of-wuhan-china-novel-virus/4563892002/) on a 54-year-old of Chinese nationality and a traveling companion who have been quarantined. 

The traveling companions reportedly boarded the ship on Jan. 25 in Savona, Italy, and one of them developed fevers and difficulty breathing, according to a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly.

*Costa Smeralda* is currently docked at the port of Civitavecchia, Italy. Because the ship is operating under a sanitary protocol to isolate the sick passengers, none of the passengers or crew onboard are being allowed to disembark while medical teams run tests on the passenger.

*Costa Smeralda* is Costa Cruises’ newest and largest ship. Delivered in 2019, she is also only the second cruise ship in the world to be fully powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Many cruise lines; including Costa, Holland America, MSC, Princess, Royal Caribbean, and Seaborn; have [canceled or altered itineraries](https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5016/) to Chinese ports over concerns of spreading the coronavirus. Virtually all cruise lines are implementing advanced virus screening procedures.
