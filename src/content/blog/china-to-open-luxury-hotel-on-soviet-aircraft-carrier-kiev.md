Hotel Kiev?

The Chinese are opening a 148 room [luxury hotel in the refurbished Russian aircraft carrier](http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/visit/china-open-luxury-hotel-soviet-aircraft-carrier-431980) *[Kiev.](http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/visit/china-open-luxury-hotel-soviet-aircraft-carrier-431980)*  Since 2004, the aircraft carrier has been part  of what is billed as “the world’s biggest military theme park” in [Tianjin](http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/province/tianjin.html), a municipality close to [Beijing](http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/province/beijing.html).   The Chinese also own the Russian aircraft carrier *[Minsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_aircraft_carrier_Minsk)*, a sister vessel to the *Kiev*, which is the centerpiece of [Minsk World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_World),  a military theme park in [Shenzhen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen "Shenzhen"), China.  The Chinese military owns a third Russian carrier, the *[Varyag](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/08/10/from-varyag-to-shi-lang-the-long-strange-voyage-of-chinas-new-twenty-year-old-aircraft-carrier/)*, whose keel was laid in 1985 but which was never finished.  The Chinese have been working to finish the ship as an aircraft carrier for roughly the last decade. [The ship returned from a second round of sea trials](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/15/chinas-first-new-old-aircraft-carrier-returns-from-second-sea-trial/) in mid-December and is said to be near completion but is not yet capable of landing planes on its deck.  
  
I am only beginning to appreciate just how versatile aircraft carriers can be. Aside from the launching and landing of aircraft, [they make great basketball stadiums](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/11/hoops-on-the-nuclear-aircraft-carrier-carl-vincent/), as we have seen recently on the [USS Carl Vincent](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/11/hoops-on-the-nuclear-aircraft-carrier-carl-vincent/). The [British aircraft carrier Ark Royal just might be on its way to becoming a recreational dive site](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/feedarticle/10020218) and reef. (The HMS Hermes, launched in 1919, the first ship designed and constructed to be an aircraft carrier, is already a popular dive site where the Japanese sank her near Batticaloa Sri Lanka in 1942.  See [HMS Hermes 2011](http://youtu.be/pJx5j4XI4a4))

Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing along the article about the *Ark Royal.*
