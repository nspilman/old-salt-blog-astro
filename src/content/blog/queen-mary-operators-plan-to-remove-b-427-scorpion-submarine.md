![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/scorpion.jpg)Are you interested in acquiring a [Foxtrot-class Soviet-era submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxtrot-class_submarine)? If so, the folks at Urban Commons, the operators of the hotel and tourist attraction [*Queen Mary*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Queen_Mary) in Long Beach [may want to talk to you](https://lbpost.com/business/queen-mary-operators-plan-to-remove-scorpion-submarine/). They have a well-used submarine that they would seriously like to get rid of.

The submarine is a diesel-electric patrol submarine that was built in the Soviet Union in 1971. Designated [B-427](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_B-427), it served in the Soviet Pacific fleet for 23 years. After decommissioning, she was loaned to Australian National Maritime Museum for display as a museum vessel between 1995 and 19998.

In 1998, the submarine was moved to Long Beach, California and was berthed next to the *Queen Mary*. The submarine was opened to the public as the “Podvodnaya Lodka B-427 *Scorpion*.” The submarine was a Long Beach tourist attraction for almost two decades. It was not well maintained, however. In 2012, the submarine partially flooded and in 2016, it was closed to visitors.  

The submarine now also interferes with a major redevelopment project and Urban Commons, the operators of the *Queen Mary* would like to get rid of the submarine. They hope to find someone to take the *Scorpion* off its hands and some maritime museums have expressed interest. One immediate obstacle is the rock breakwater which surrounds both the *Queen Mary* and the submarine.  At least part of the breakwater would have to be taken down to allow the submarine to be removed.
