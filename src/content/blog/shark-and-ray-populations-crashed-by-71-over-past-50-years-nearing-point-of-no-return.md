A recent study, published in the journal [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03173-9), reveals that oceanic shark and ray populations have declined by 71%, primarily due to overfishing.

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/climate/sharks-population-study.html) quotes Nathan Pacoureau, a marine biologist at Simon Fraser University in Canada and the study’s lead author, saying, “There is a very small window to save these iconic creatures.”  Out of a total of 31 species of oceanic sharks and rays, 24 are now threatened with extinction, and many are classified as critically endangered. The loss of sharks and rays jeopardizes marine ecosystems and the food security of people in many nations.

Sharks and rays are taken for their meat, fins, gill plates and liver oil. They are also frequently caught incidentally by fishermen using nets or long lines with thousands of baited hooks to attract tuna or swordfish.

The authors of the study conclude that strict prohibitions and precautionary science-based catch limits are urgently needed to avert population collapse.
