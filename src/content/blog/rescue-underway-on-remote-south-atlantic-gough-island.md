A [rescue is underway to save 62 seafarers stranded on Gough Island](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/seafarers-stranded-on-remote-south-atlantic-island-after-vessel-sinks) in the South Atlantic, one of the most remote islands in the world. The fishing/research vessel, [*Geo Searcher*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/GEO-SEARCHER-IMO-8028498-MMSI-312413000), is reported to have sunk after hitting rocks about a mile off the island. The crew took to lifeboats and landed on Gough Island, making their way to an island weather station. There were two reported injures but neither were life-threatening.

The [South African Maritime Safety Authority​ (SAMSA)](http://www.samsa.org.za/Pages/default.aspx) has sent the polar supply and research vessel, *SA Agulhas II*, to rescue the stranded crew.  The ship has [two helicopters and a doctor](https://www.capetalk.co.za/articles/398895/sa-agulhas-ii-en-route-to-rescue-47-south-africans-from-gough-island) on board. *SA Agulhas II* is expected to arrive sometime tomorrow.

[Gough Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Island) is approximately 250 miles southeast of [Tristan da Cunha](https://www.tristandc.com/index.php) and more than 1,700 miles west of Cape Town, South Africa.
