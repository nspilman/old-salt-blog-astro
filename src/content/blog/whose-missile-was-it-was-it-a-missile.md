**Update:** One [blogger](http://blog.bahneman.com/content/it-was-us-airways-flight-808) has plotted the trajectories and determined that the contrail was that of [US Airways flight 808](http://blog.bahneman.com/content/it-was-us-airways-flight-808).   At least no one is claiming that it was a weather balloon.  The [Daily Show has its own spin.](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-november-10-2010/missile--impossible?xrs=share_copy)

On Monday night what appeared to be a missile launch from the Pacific ocean was video-taped 35 miles out to sea, west of L.A. and north of Catalina Island.  Thus far, no one has been able to identify who launched the missile or even if a missile was launched.
