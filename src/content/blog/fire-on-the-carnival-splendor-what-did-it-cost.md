![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/carnival-splendor-fire-150x84.jpg)What did the fire on the *Carnival Splendor* cost Carnival Corporation?  No one really knows exactly, but [Carnival announced](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=140690&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1497049&highlight=) that they estimate a cost of 7 cents per share.   Based on the number of outstanding shares from their 2009 10k, on a fully diluted basis, that puts the estimated cost at around $56 million dollars.   Most of this is presumably lost revenue from the cruise operations. The *Splendor* will be out of service until mid January, 2011.
