![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/10/Columbus.jpg)Today is Columbus Day in the United States (and Thanksgiving Day in Canada. Happy Thanksgiving Canadians.)  Columbus Day is celebrated tomorrow in Spain.

Every year about this time,  various scholars and pundits emerge to denigrate the memory of the Genoese naviator and explorer.   There were indeed many things for which Christoffa Corombo, as he was known in his home of Genoa, could be criticized for.   He never reached China.  He severely underestimated the circumference of the Earth, (which may have been more Ptolomy’s fault that Christoffa’s.)

Of course, these are not the faults for which what the modern pundits condemn Columbus.   Columbus was indeed an imperialist and he promoted genocide.  The man was clearly a monster!  Or so they contend. Howard Zinn is his book [A People’s History of The United States](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061965588?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061965588) makes the case:  
  
“*To emphasize the heroism of Columbus and his successors as navigators and discoverers, and to de-emphasize their genocide, is not a technical necessity but an ideological choice. It serves- unwittingly-to justify what was done. My point is not that we must, in telling history, accuse, judge, condemn Columbus in absentia. It is too late for that; it would be a useless scholarly exercise in morality. But the easy acceptance of atrocities as a deplorable but necessary price to pay for progress (Hiroshima and Vietnam, to save Western civilization; Kronstadt and Hungary, to save socialism; nuclear proliferation, to save us all)-that is still with us.”*

What Mr. Zinn so obviously fails to grasp is that to admire Columbus’ heroism is not to excuse his sins nor the sins of his time.  Contrary to Zinn’s histrionics, neither Columbus’ courage nor his failures do anything whatsoever to justify Vietnam or Hiroshima or any other crimes or atrocities of our time.

What is absurd and simply bizarre is that historians like Zinn lack, or simply choose to ignore, historical context.   Columbus was not a man of the twenty-first century and to judge him by contemporary standards is ridiculous.

What Columbus was, was a man of his time.  His perspective was not significantly different from that of most 15th century mariners, merchants and rulers.   Slavery was an ancient tradition, endorsed by the Bible.  Of course, Columbus would view the native Americans as potential slaves.  And, of course, Columbus was an imperialist.  He was funded by the empire of Spain.   What else could he be?  Columbus’ treatment of native Americans was not significantly worse than the treatment of Europeans by other Europeans of the time.   Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492.  The Spanish Inquisition, established in 1478, was intensified after the royal decrees also issued in 1492.    Zinn, and others like him, condemn Columbus’ slaughter of native Americans in Santo Domingo while ignoring the auto de fes of Seville.   History without context is simply nonsense.

Columbus was what he was – a sailor and navigator of the 15th century. We should take from history the lessons of both heroism and evil.  To admire the former is not to endorse the latter.

Happy Columbus Day everyone.
