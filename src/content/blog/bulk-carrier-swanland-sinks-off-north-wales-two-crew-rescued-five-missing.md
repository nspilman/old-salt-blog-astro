**Update:** [Prince William](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge) co-piloted the Sea King helicopter which rescued two crew from the sinking *Swanland.*   Prince William serves with RAF Valley in north Wales.

The bulk carrier *Swanland* is reported to have sunk this morning off north  Wales in heavy weather.  Two of the crew of eight have been rescued, one body has been recovered and five crew members are still missing. The *Swanland* was carrying a cargo of 3,000 tonnes of limestone when it sank between 20 and 30 miles north-west of the Lleyn peninsula.

In August of last year, the *Swanland* narrowly avoided grounding on Lizard Point, Cornwall following an engine failure.  The Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s emergency towing vessel, *Anglian Princess*, towed the ship to safety into Falmouth.
