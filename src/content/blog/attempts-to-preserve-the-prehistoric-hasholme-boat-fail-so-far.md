![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/hasholme_boat.jpg)The [Hasholme boat](http://www.holmeonspaldingmoor.co.uk/hasholme%20boat.htm), discovered in 1984 in a former inlet of the Humber estuary near Holme on Spalding Moor, dates from the late Iron Age ( 750-390 BC ). The boat was cut from a single oak tree and was originally roughly 42 feet long (12.87 m), with a beam of 4.6 feet (1.4 m) and a depth of 4.1 feet (1.25 m).   Now after attempts to preserve the boat by spraying it with chemical wax preservative have failed, archeologists are considering allowing the boat to air dry.

[Experts forced into rethink after bid to preserve prehistoric Hasholme Boat fails](http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/news/Experts-forced-rethink-bid-preserve-prehistoric-Hasholme-Boat-fails/article-2756752-detail/article.html)  
  
*Thought to be around 2,300-years-old, the boat was initially taken to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich for detailed recording and analysis.*

*It was later relocated to the Hull and East Riding Museum in High Street, Hull, and placed in a specially-designed chamber.*

*Since then, the boat has been constantly sprayed with a special type of chemical wax in order to preserve it.*

*Experts have to wear special protective clothing to enter the chamber.*

*But now officials have conceded the intensive, but expensive, technique is no longer viable.*

*They also say the vessel has actually suffered some deterioration as a result of the wax spraying.*

*Leaks in the chamber and health and safety concerns over the spray system led to it being shut down last December.*

*A subsequent review of the project has led to a decision to switch to a new air-drying preservation method instead.*

*Simon Green, assistant head of culture and lifestyle at Hull City Council, said the problems encountered with the Hasholme Boat mirrored those found using the same preservation method on the Henry VIII’s flagship the Mary Rose, the country’s best-known maritime wreck.*
