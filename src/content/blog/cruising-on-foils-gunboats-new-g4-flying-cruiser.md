Gunboat G4 with J foil daggerboards and T foil rudders

Very interesting news. [Gunboat](http://www.gunboat.com/home/gunboat-home-page), builder of high-end racing/cruising catamarans, has promised the [G4, a new all carbon fiber 40 foot long catamaran,](http://www.gunboat.com/series/gunboat-g4) in early 2015.  The drawings and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGeFS5fQPxc) have shown C-foil daggerboards and T-foil rudders. C-foils allow “foil-assisted” sailing. The C-foils develop lift and are capable of supporting most of the catamaran’s weight but will not lift the boat entirely out of the water.  Since at least last Spring, however, there have been suggestions that Gunboat has something more ambitious in mind. They may be offering fully-foiling daggerboards, referred to variously as J or L foils, which would allow the G4 to fly like an America’s Cup AC 70, qualifying as the first flying cruising catamaran.  Gunboat’s founder, Peter Johnstone, has said of the G4 — “It’s the baddest-ass coastal cruiser ever.”

In an interview with [Sailing Anarchy](http://sailinganarchy.com/tag/j-foils/) from last May, Gunboat team member Rudo Enserink revealed the following:

*SA: With the J-boards and T-rudders, this is looking like a full foiler.  Is that really possible on a boat with bunks and a kitchen?*

*RE: Yes and no. We’re first going to build high-lift C-foils for safe but very fast foil-assisted sailing.  The mildly asymmetric C-boards can be raked from -1 to +7 degrees and will be set at the factory for safe cruising.   The lift of these foils maxes out at 80% of displacement, and advanced owners can play with the rake adjustment to optimize for purpose and conditions.  One of the great things about C-foils is that you can leave the windward daggerboard deployed in all tacks.*  *The hull and daggerboard casing structure is prepared for full foiling, as are daggerboard bearings and rudder bearings.*

*If there’s enough interest from the market we’ll develop an electronically stabilized full foiling package that will be available as aftermarket upgrade. The current concept for this is an L-foil and auto-leveling T-rudders.*

A post today on [Tony Hodge’s blog at Yachting World](http://www.yachtingworld.com/blogs/toby-hodges-blog/gunboat-g4-the-first-flying-cruising-yacht/) appears to confirm this, but is a touch unclear. The graphics on the post show the G4 sporting J-foil daggerboards, while the post text says  “*The daggerboards are C-shaped…*”

The post also notes: *In just 12-knots wind for example, the G4 should already be up and flying at a predicted 18 knots. One of the designers, DNA’s Mischa Heemskerk, who has reportedly had the foiling GC32 up to 37 knots, thinks the G4 is capable of another 10–15%.  Can you imagine that? 40-knot plus speeds!*

It will be very interesting to see how this technology functions on a catamaran with accommodations for cruising.
