![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ussmccaindamage.jpg)Following the recent collision of a tanker with the US Navy destroyer USS [*John S. McCain*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/08/destroyer-uss-john-s-mccain-collides-tanker-10-missing-5-injured/), in which 10 sailors are missing, the [US Navy has dismissed Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/08/22/navy-7-th-fleet-commander-joseph-aucoin/592685001/) as commander of the 7th Fleet. There have been four significant casualties involving ships of the 7th fleet in Asia this year. The casualties include the collision of the [USS *Fitzgerald*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/06/destroyer-uss-fitzgerald-collides-container-ship-seven-missing/) with a container ship in June off the coast of Japan, killing seven sailors. Rear Admiral Phil Sawyer, who had already been named to succeed Admiral Aucoin earlier, has assumed command of the 7th Fleet.

US Navy divers have been reported to have located “[some remains](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/21/politics/uss-john-s-mccain-collision/index.html)” in the flooded sections of the destroyer. Malaysian officials are also reported to have found one body, which is still being identified.

In response to the series of casualties, Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson has called for an [immediate “operational pause” across the U.S. fleet](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/military/the-intel/sd-me-mccain-collision-20170821-story.html) so commanders can assess safety. 

There has been speculation that collision involving the two Aegis missile destroyers, Fitzgerald and McCain, may have been the result of cyber attacks on the ship.  [Military.com](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/08/21/richardson-no-indication-uss-mccain-collision-due-foul-play.html) reports, however, that “*the chief of Naval Operations told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday that, in the case of the collision of the USS John S. McCain with a Liberian-flagged merchant ship, there was so far no evidence that external or unfriendly forces played a role.”*

*“That’s certainly something we are giving full consideration to, but we have no indication that that’s the case yet,” Adm. John Richardson said. “But we’re looking at every possibility, so we’re not leaving anything to chance.”*

[CNN reports](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/21/politics/uss-john-s-mccain-collision/index.html) that “*the McCain suffered a steering failure as the warship was beginning its approach into the Strait of Malacca, causing it to collide with a commercial tanker, a Navy official told CNN. The official said it was unclear why the crew couldn’t use the ship’s backup steering systems to maintain control. Earlier, another US Navy official told CNN there were indications the destroyer experienced a loss of steering right before the collision, but steering had been regained afterward.*“
