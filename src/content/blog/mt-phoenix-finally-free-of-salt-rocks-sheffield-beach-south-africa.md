MT Phoenix on Sheffield Beach

The [MT *Phoenix*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MT_Phoenix_\(2011\)), which has been hard aground and leaking oil on a South African beach, is finally free. This Saturday, two salvage tugs, *Smit Amanda* and *Smit Siyanda*, under the direction of the South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA), successfully towed the ship into deep water.

  
The final voyage of the *Phoenix* has been difficult. to say the least. In early July of this year, the 1977 built, 18,000 tonne tanker was on its way to a scrap yard in India when it suffered engine failure and almost drifted ashore near the South African town of Hamburg.  The ship was towed to Durban, where it was at anchor until on the evening of July 25th, when it dragged its anchor in a storm and went aground on the Salt Rocks at Sheffield Beach just north of Ballito.

SAMSA is currently evaluating whether the ship can safely be towed to her final destination.   The clean-up operation of leaked diesel fuel and oil from the ships has thus far cost than R10-million and could run to R200-million (from around US$1.5 to US$30 million.) The cost will likely be borne by South African taxpayers.
