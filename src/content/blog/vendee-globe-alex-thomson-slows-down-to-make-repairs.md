Communication technology these days is an absolute marvel.  [Alex Thomson](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/122/alex-thomson), who led the fleet for most of the first two weeks of the [Vendee Globe](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en) race, is now slowing down to make repairs to the damaged longitudinal structure in the bow of his IMOCA 60 *Hugo Boss*. Fortunately, he has the tools and material aboard to make the repair and an entire team of designers, engineers, and boatbuilders advising him by video while he does it.

Remarkably, Thomson made a video, now posted on YouTube, allowing us to virtually crawl up into the bow, to take a look at the cracked carbon fiber girders, as the boat sails on in the South Atlantic. Fortunately, Alex discovered the damage and will have an opportunity to make repairs before sailing into the really nasty conditions in the Southern Ocean.
