![bluewhaleentangled](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bluewhaleentangled.jpg)On Monday, a [70-80 foot long blue whale entangled in crab or fish nets and lines](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/27/us/blue-whale-entangled-in-fishing-gear/) was spotted off the coast of Dana Point in southern California.  A marine mammal rescue team attempted cut the nets and lines to free the whale but were only partially successful. Teams are attempting to locate the tangled whale today to finish the job.

Blue whales can usually break out of ropes and nets because of their size and power, according to Michael Milstein, spokesman for NOAA Fisheries. Entangled humpback and gray whales are more common.  However, this would be the second reported incident of a blue whale entanglement off the U.S. West Coast in two years. Last fall, a blue whale was also entangled in fishing gear.

Overall, whale entanglements with fishing gear on the West Coast are rising. In a statement by [The Center for Biological Diversity](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2016/whale-entanglements-06-09-2016.html) from earlier this month, they note that “*nearly 40 reports of whales entangled in fishing gear have been recorded off the West Coast in 2016 — including at least 20 whales that are estimated to still be entangled — putting this year on pace to break the record for the third straight year. Although some whales are able to escape from fishing gear, often with the help of California Whale Rescue teams that are now being overwhelmed with entanglement reports, those that continue to drag fishing gear can die slow, painful deaths*.”

The Center went on to call on Dungeness crab fishermen to observe last month’s voluntary advisory and to remove more fishing lines from Monterey Bay and other entanglement hot spots where whales, including endangered humpback and blue whales, are now feeding.
