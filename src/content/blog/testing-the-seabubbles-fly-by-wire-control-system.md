![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/seabubbletest.jpg)A year and a half ago we posted about [SeaBubbles — foiling electric water taxis](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/11/seabubbles-foiling-electric-water-taxis-tested-paris/). The idea to develop a five-person water taxi comes from [Alain Thébault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Th%C3%A9bault), the designer and skipper of record-breaking ocean-going hydrofoil [*Hydroptère*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropt%C3%A8re). The distance from an idea to implementation, however, can be considerable. The [SeaBubbles](http://www.seabubbles.fr/en/) feature fully submerged foils which require a sophisticated control system for the craft to remain stable. The SeaBubble team are attempting to achieve a ride as smooth as a car on a well-paved road by using an advanced fly-by-wire control system. Fly-by-wire is a term used in aeronautics to describe a semiautomatic computer-regulated system for controlling the flight of an aircraft. While the SeaBubbles will not take off, they will be flying on foils. Here is a short video about the SeaBubble fly-by-wire system.
