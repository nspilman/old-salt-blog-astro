[David Hayes](http://www.historicnavalfiction.com/) passed along a video of the *[USS Pegasus](http://www.navysite.de/pboats/phm1.htm)*, a hydrofoil patrol boat that was billed as the “vanguard of the new navy,”  thirty five years ago.   While the *Pegasus* was not the first of many hydrofoils as was intended in 1975, the development of high speed coastal craft did not stop.   The US Navy is currently building two classes of [Littoral Combat Ships (LCS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littoral_combat_ship).    [Maritime Executive reported today](http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/congress-approves-contracts-20-littoral-combat-ships/) that the Congress has approved contracts for Marinette Marine and Austal to each build ten littoral combat ships for the US Navy.   Will the new LCS class ships serve as the “vanguard of the new navy?” Only time will tell.   Video of the USS *Independence* (LCS2) after the jump.
