On Saturday, January 14, the US Coast Guard rescued seven crewmembers from the tug [*Legacy*](https://www.dvidshub.net/image/7589841/tug-boat-legacy), disabled and drifting about 30 miles off the coast of Ocean City, New Jersey.

The Coast Guard reports that the tug *Legacy* notified watchstanders at [Coast Guard Sector Maryland-National Capital Region](https://www.atlanticarea.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/District-5/District-Units/Sector-Maryland-National-Capital-Region/sites/) at about 3:30 a.m. Saturday that while towing a 290-foot barge from New Jersey, to Guyana, a 1,000-foot towing line became entangled and fouled their starboard propeller. The vessel continued to make way on one engine when the tow line snapped. The crew attempted to regain tow of the barge at which time the line became tangled in the port propeller immobilizing the vessel. The tug’s crew member said *Legacy* was inoperable and that the crew was making preparations to abandon ship.

The 154-foot [Coast Guard Cutter *Lawrence Lawson*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Lawrence_O._Lawson), homeported in Cape May, New Jersey, was already underway and diverted to the incident to help. Once on scene, the cutter’s crew was unable to get near the disabled tug or barge due to on-scene weather and concern that the loose tow line beneath the water’s surface would foul the Coast Guard cutter’s propellers. The *Lawrence Lawson* maintained station and provided critical assistance to responding units and ensured the safety of the seven crew members.

Coast Guard Sector Maryland-National Capitol Region launched an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter crew from Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City, New Jersey, and an MH-60 Jayhawk crew from Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, North Carolina, to hoist the seven people from the vessel. After all seven people were safely hoisted, the aircrews transported them to Ocean City Municipal Airport in Maryland with no reported injuries.

The tug’s crew activated their emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB), and the Coast Guard MH-60 deployed a self-locating data marker buoy (SLDMB) for Coast Guard watchstanders to track the tug and barge while awaiting commercial salvage.

Just after noon Sunday, some 32 hours after *Legacy*‘s crew called for help, the Coast Guard issued a notice to mariners advising that “an unmanned towing vessel (LEGACY) and 290 foot barge are adrift approximately 55 NM east of Paramore Island, VA.” The Coast Guard continued, “The towing vessel and barge are not connected and drifting south at approximately 2 knots. Both are unlit and pose a hazard to navigation.”

USCG asked all boaters to keep a “sharp lookout” and report any sightings to Sector Virginia on Channel 16 or call (757) 483-8567.

The *Legacy* was built in 1981 at Houston as *Goliath.* The tug, acquired in 2022 by Boss Marine and Service Inc., Georgetown, Guayana, was underway from Dorchester Shipyard, New Jersey to Kingstown, Saint Vincent and then to Guayana.
