Not long left to register for the [International Sail Training and Tall Ships Conference 2010](http://www.sailtraininginternational.org/events/annual-conference/annual-conference-2010) to be held on 12th – 13th November 2010 in Stavanger, Norway.

*The International Sail Training and Tall Ships Conference 2010 will provide tailored programmes to meet the needs and interests of key delegate groups and being the only global conference for sail training, provides a great opportunity to network.*

*This year the Conference will be held on 12th and 13th November in Stavanger, Norway. The City of Stavanger is no stranger to Tall Ships events, having been a host port on several occasions and will be again in 2011.*

*Located within Norway’s spectacular fjords, Stavanger has a strong maritime heritage developed through fishing and ship building. Delegates will find it easy to travel to Stavanger where the conference will be located in the Stavanger Forum Conference Centre, 5 minutes by bus from the city centre. They can look forward to wonderful hospitality and the opportunity to visit some of the beautiful and interesting sights in and around the city.*

*The conference is a ‘must attend’ event, open to everyone involved in sail training for young people and thanks to the generous sponsorship from the city of Stavanger, the delegate rates will remain at the same cost as last year.*
