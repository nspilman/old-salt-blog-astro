![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/cityadelaidewebpic.jpg)The [clipper ship *City of Adelaide*](http://cityofadelaide.org.au/) (later HMS *Carrick*), the oldest surviving composite clipper ship in the world, was at serious risk of being broken up until a [deal was  struck last August](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/28/clipper-ship-city-of-adelaide-to-be-sent-to-australia/) to move the ship from the [Scottish Maritime Museum](http://www.scottishmaritimemuseum.org/) in Irvine, Scotland, back to its namesake city in Australia – Adelaide.   Next week, the fabrication of a 100-tonne steel cradle, to support the historic clipper will begin.   [See our previous posts about the efforts to save the *City of Adelaide.*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/index.php?s=City+of+Adelaide+)

[City of Adelaide work to begin](http://portside-messenger.whereilive.com.au/news/story/city-of-adelaide-work-to-begin/)  
  
*A ceremony to mark the start of the project will be held at Samaras Structural Engineers on Monday morning (June 27).*

*A bottle of champagne will be cracked over the first piece of the cradle by Pam Whittle, the great-grand-daughter of the clipper’s first captain, David Bruce, and Marion Wells, the great-great-granddaughter of migrant Matilda Methuen.*

*The clipper and cradle will then be rolled onto a barge for transfer to a deep port at Rotterdam, where it will be transferred to a larger ship for the voyage to Port Adelaide.*
