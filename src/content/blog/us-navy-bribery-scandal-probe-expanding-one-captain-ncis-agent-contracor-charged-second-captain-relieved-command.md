Capt. Daniel Dusek

Last month, the [former captain of the destroyer *USS Mustin*, a Navy special agent and a Singapore-based defense contractor](http://www.stripes.com/news/us/former-uss-mustin-commander-ncis-agent-arrested-for-bribery-1.241930) were charged in an alleged bribery scheme to swap classified ship information for luxury travel and prostitutes. Cmdr. Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz, a captain-select, who commanded *Mustin* and later served as deputy operations officer aboard the [*USS Blue Ridge*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Blue_Ridge_\(LCC-19\)) for the Yokosuka-based U.S. 7th Fleet, is alleged to have steered the aircraft carriers [*USS George Washington*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_George_Washington_\(CVN-73\)) and [*USS John C. Stennis*,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_John_C._Stennis_\(CVN-74\)) the *USS Blue Ridge* and other ships to ports served by ports chosen by [Glenn Defense Marine Asia](http://www.glennmarinegroup.com/), or GDMA, where the company could overcharge the Navy for millions of dollars in services to the ships.   Naval Criminal Investigative Service supervisory agent John Bertrand Beliveau II and Leonard Glenn Francis, head GDMA, have also been arrested.

The bribery probe appears to be widening.  Yesterday, [Navy officials boarded the amphibious assault ship *USS Bonhomme Richard* to relieve Capt. Daniel Dusek of his command](http://www.stripes.com/news/navy/2nd-high-ranking-navy-officer-relieved-of-duty-as-bribery-probe-expands-1.244597). Captain Dusek has not been charged with a crime, but is under investigation by the Justice Department in the bribery scandal.  The investigation has focused on an alleged scheme to swap classified ship information for luxury travel and prostitutes.
