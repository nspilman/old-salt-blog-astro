![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/caledonia.jpg)An interested court case between a private salvor and the State of New York appears to have been settled in favor of the state.   The salvor, Northeast Research, claimed the 19th century schooner, which it claims is the *Caledonia. They had planned to raise the vessel and display it in a large tank on the Buffalo waterfront.   New York State counted that as positive identification of the ship had not been made, the ship was state property under the U.S. Abandoned Shipwreck Act.    The judge sided with New York State which wants to leave the wreck in place in 170 feet of water in Lake Erie.*
