As the tragedy of the *Costa Concordia* plays out, newspapers still need to sell ads.  Recently some of the juxtapositions have been, well, unfortunate. (Click on any of the thumbnails below for a larger image.)

Seven Continents. Infinite Possibilities.”) next to the headline, “*Passengers Tell of Delayed, then Panicked Evacuation*, ” was not the best choice.

Britain’s *Guardian’s* juxtaposition was not advertising but another headline. Directly beneath a photo of the *Costa Concordia*‘s stack just above the water the *Guardian* ran the headline for another story, “*Give Queen a new royal yacht for jubilee, says minister.*”  Whatever the merits of that idea, I doubt the Queen would be interested in the *Costa Concordia.*
