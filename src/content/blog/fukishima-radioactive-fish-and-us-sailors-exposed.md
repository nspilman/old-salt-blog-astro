The impact of  the meltdown of nuclear reactors at the Fukishima Daiichi power plant, hit by the following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011, is still unfolding.  Last month it was revealed that [fish caught near the crippled power plant were measured to have radiation levels 100 times above normal.](http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/2012/11/17/301--Fukushima-radiation-in-fish-100-times-above-norm-.html)   The levels found ranged from 4,400 Becquerels per kg to 11,400 Bequerels per kg, against the maximum “safe” level of 100 Bequerels per kg.

This week eight sailors from the US aircraft carrier [*Ronald Reagan*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Ronald_Reagan_\(CVN-76\)) sued Tokyo Electric Power Co. The sailors claim that they were exposed to unacceptably high levels of radiation during disaster relief operations and that the utility lied about the dangers.

*The sailors aboard the USS Ronald Reagan nuclear-powered aircraft carrier were involved in disaster relief operations following the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan that caused the meltdown…*

*The Japanese government was “lying through their teeth about the reactor meltdown” as it reassured the crew of USS Reagan that “everything is under control,” the plaintiffs’ lawyers said in the complaint. “The plaintiffs must now endure a lifetime of radiation poisoning and suffering.”*

*The sailors each sought $10 million in damages, $30 million in punitive damages and a judgment requiring the creation of a $100 million fund to pay for their medical monitoring and treatments.*
