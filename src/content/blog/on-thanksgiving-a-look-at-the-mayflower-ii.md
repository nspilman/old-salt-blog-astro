In the United States, today is celebrated as Thanksgiving, commermorating a 1621 feast of thanks-giving at the Plymouth colony in present-day Massachusetts. The year before in November of 1620 the ship *[Mayflower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower)* had carried a group of just over 100 English and Dutch Separatists, known as [Pilgrims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrims_\(Plymouth_Colony\)), across the Atlantic to the new colony.  Here is a short video about the [*Mayflower II*](http://www.plimoth.org/what-see-do/mayflower-ii), a replica of the original built in Devon, England, in a collaboration between  [Warwick Charlton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Charlton) and [the Plimoth Plantation](http://www.plimoth.org/).  On April 20, 1957, Mayflower II recreated the original voyage, sailing across the Atlantic under the command of [Alan Villiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Villiers).
