This post is not quite nautical, but it does involving sailing. [The Planetary Society](http://planetary.org/), a non-government, nonprofit organization, is sending sailing ships out to explore space, sailing on the light of the sun.  The [first prototype completed a generally successful test mission](http://www.space.com/29628-lightsail-solar-sail-success-photo.html) earlier this month. A larger 32 square meter [LightSail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightSail-1) is scheduled to be launched in 2016. The project is being funded by a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theplanetarysociety/lightsail-a-revolutionary-solar-sailing-spacecraft).
