After more than seven years in US waters, the longship [*Draken Harald Hårfagre*](https://www.drakenhh.com/about-the-ship), known as the world’s largest Viking ship currently sailing, is returning home to Norway. The 115-foot-long ship left its [temporary home at Mystic Seaport Museum](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/07/draken-harald-harfagre-a-viking-ship-at-mystic-seaport/) on Sunday, May 19 bound for [Newport, RI](https://whatsupnewp.com/2024/05/viking-ship-draken-harald-harfagre-will-stop-in-newport-before-heading-home-to-norway/) where it will await the arrival of the [Dutch yacht transport ship *Stadiongracht*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/9202508) to arrive.

*Draken* is expected to be loaded onboard *Stationgracht* on May 26 outside Newport Harbor. *Stadiongracht* should arrive in Stavanger, Norway, on June 4, where Draken will be offloaded.

*Draken* and her crew [sailed across the North Atlantic in 2016.](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/09/dragon-big-city-draken-harald-harfagre-north-cove/) On its tours along the coastlines of the United States, the ship transformed into a floating classroom and a hub for community gatherings. Over the years, hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic visitors have walked her deck, eager to step aboard, listen to the stories of modern ocean explorers, and experience the Viking legacy firsthand.

The *Draken*’s return to Norway marks a new preparation phase for future voyages. “Our vision of fostering global exploration and education continues to guide us as we plan future expeditions and seek to expand our educational programs. We are also exploring the continuation of our popular television series, which brings the adventures of the *Draken* to audiences worldwide,” says Emanuel Persson, CEO & Expedition Director for the *Draken*.

A short video of the *Draken* arriving at North Cove in New York City in 2016:
