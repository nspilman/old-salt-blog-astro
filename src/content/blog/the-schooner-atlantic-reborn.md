In 1905, the three masted [schooner yacht](http://www.yachtingworld.com/news/414783/atlantic-reincarnated) *[Atlantic](http://www.yachtingworld.com/news/414783/atlantic-reincarnated)* sailed 3006 miles in twelve days, four hours, one minute and nine seconds; winning the Kaiser’s Cup from New York to the Lizard and setting the record for the fastest transatlantic passage by a monohull, during a race.  The record stood for over a century and the *Atlantic* became a legend.

In 2007, Dutch entrepreneur, [Ed Kastelein](http://www.charterworld.com/news/sailing-schooner-atlantic-profile-entrepreneur-ed-kastelein), commissioned the building of a new *[Atlantic](http://www.schooner-atlantic.com/index.html),* based on original plans of the William Gardner design.  Now three years after her keel was laid,  she sailed for the first time at the end of June.   The schooner is 185 feet (56 metres) on deck, with a waterline length of 138 feet (42 meters) and a bowsprit to boom length of 227 feet (69 metres).

*Finally, on June 23rd 2010, sailing schooner Atlantic sailed out to the sea. Three years after her keel was laid she was ready and eager to go. The Owner, Ed Kastelein, saw his long term dream come true, as he witnesses his family, guest and crew step on board of Atlantic yacht. The weather for her launch was perfect, with gentle northerly breeze blowing.*

*The season has seen the sailing yacht Atlantic cruise the Atlantic coast of France, Spain and Portugal, then the Balearics going towards the South coast of the Mediterranean, Sardinia and finally she will anchor at Cannes around September. She is able to accommodate 12 guest and has a crew of 12 onboard.*
