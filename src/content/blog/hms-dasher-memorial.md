Last week, we [posted about a new book](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/24/after-67-years-the-truth-of-hms-dasher-tragedy-is-revealed/) which examines the causes of the tragic explosion and sinking of the *[HMS Dasher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Dasher_\(D37\))*, in which 379 out of 528 crewmen died  and ranks as one of Britain’s worst naval disasters during World War II.   [David Hayes](http://www.historicnavalfiction.com/) was kind enough to point out video footage from the 2007 memorial weekend for survivors, families of survivors and those lost when the *HMS Dasher* sunk off of Arran on 27th March 1943.
