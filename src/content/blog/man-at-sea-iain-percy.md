*Man at Sea* is one of Alfred Dunhill’s ‘[Portraits of Achievement](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbCANSZkGcAvjF8DLp7_xF_J0zZo1VrDp)‘. It is five years old, but new to me. 

*Man at Sea* is an ode to the sea and one man’s life long passion for sailing on it, following Iain Percy OBE, British sailor and Olympic Champion. Setting sail from Lymington in the New Forest district of Hampshire in the yacht *Strega*, Iain tackles the wind and the waves on The Solent strait between the Isle of Wight and the mainland England.

“*The boat suddenly becomes weightless and you’re surfing. You almost become mesmerised as you catch the next wave and the wave after*”

– Iain Percy
