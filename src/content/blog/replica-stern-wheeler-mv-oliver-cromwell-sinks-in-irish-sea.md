![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/05/ocromwellsinking.jpg)The [replica stern-wheeler MV *Oliver Cromwell* sank in the Irish Sea](https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/28/historic-paddle-steamer-mv-oliver-cromwell-sinks-bottom-irish-sea-way-new-owner-7582875/) while under tow from Gloucester to Northern Ireland. The vessel was reported to have started taking on water 10 miles west of South Stack near Holyhead, Anglesey, on Friday, sinking within three hours after the Coast Guard was called. No one was aboard the vessel when she sank and there was no marine pollution reported. 

The Mississippi-style riverboat was built as a Dutch barge in 1922 and was converted to a riverboat hotel in 1993, traveling between Gloucester and Worcester. In a [statement](http://river.englishholidaycruises.co.uk/oliver-cromwell-sinks-in-the-irish-sea-on-the-way-to-coleraine-n-ireland/), the previous owners said, that “*after many years of sailing the Severn as a hotel boat she was moored up as a static venue in the docks from 2009, primarily because the costs involved in renewing her passenger license were prohibitive*.”  

While the *Oliver Cromwell* is being referred to as a “paddle steamer” it appears that the stern wheel was decorative and that she was powered by a shaft-driven propeller. As a motor vessel, she was also not a steamer.
