The US Coast Guard rarely gets enough credit for the remarkable work that they do in routinely rescuing mariners in often extremely dangerous conditions. A new movie, “[The Finest Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I0ifMz5PbQ)“, is coming out this winter, which tells the story of what is considered by many to be the greatest small-boat rescue in Coast Guard history — the heroic effort to save the crew of the [SS *Pendleton*](http://www.uscg.mil/history/Pendleton_Index.asp) in a horrible nor’easter off the coast of Massachusetts in 1952. Four men — coxswain Bernard C. Webber and his crew Andrew J. Fitzgerald, Richard P. Livese, and Ervin E. Mask — would later receive the Gold Lifesaving Medal, the service’s highest decoration for heroism during a rescue operation.  The movie stars Chris Pine, Ben Foster and Eric Bana.
