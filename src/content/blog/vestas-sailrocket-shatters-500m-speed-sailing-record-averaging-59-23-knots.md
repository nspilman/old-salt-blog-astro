**Update**: On Sunday, the VESTAS Sailrocket 2 set a new speed record for 500M of 59.38 knots and a new one nautical mile record of an average of 55.32 knots. Both records are subject to confirmed by the WSSRC.  The current holder of the nautical mile record is Alain Thébault on *l’Hydroptère* at 51.36 knots in Hyères, France, set in September 4, 2009.  If confirmed, the Sailrocket 2 will have beaten that record by almost 4 knots.

Last year, [we posted about the attempts by the VESTAS Sailrocket](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/23/sailrocket-vs-hydroptere/) to break the sailing speed record. On Friday off Ludertiz, Namibia, they did just that over a 500M course, averaging 59.23 knots (109.69 Kmh, 68 Mph) with a peak speed of over 63 knots (116 Kph, 71 Mph). The record is still subject to World Speed Sailing Record Council (WSSRC) ratification.  The previous kiteboard record was 55.65 knots set by Rob Douglas in 2010.  A video of the record speed run:
