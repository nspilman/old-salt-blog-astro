[HMS *Warrior*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Warrior_\(1860\)) is a fascinating ship. It may be heresy to say so, but when I visited Portsmouth, I spent more time on HMS *Warrior* than I did on *Nelson’s Victory.* *Warrior* is a 40-gun steam-powered armored frigate built for the Royal Navy in 1859–61. *Warrior* and her sister ship HMS *Black Prince* were the first armor-plated, iron-hulled warships. Combining sail and steam, the two ships were briefly the largest, most powerful, and most technologically advanced warships in the world. Nevertheless, HMS *Warrior*‘s guns were never fired in anger and she was obsolete within a decade following her commissioning.

Perhaps the most remarkable thing about HMS *Warrior* is that she has survived. Her iron hull didn’t rot or hog, so she was used as a storeship and depot ship, assigned to the Royal Navy’s torpedo training school and ultimately was converted for use as an oil jetty. Restored over an eight-year period the grand old ship was returned to Portsmouth as a museum ship in 1987.  Here is a video tour of HMS *Warrior*.
