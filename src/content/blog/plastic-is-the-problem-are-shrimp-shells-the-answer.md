Discarded plastic is a major problem in today’s oceans. Plastics leach [toxic chemicals into the seawater](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090820-plastic-decomposes-oceans-seas.html) while otherwise not degrading.  Recently [researchers at Harvard University](http://www.policymic.com/articles/88989/harvard-scientists-may-have-just-solved-one-of-the-biggest-environmental-issues-of-our-time?utm_source=policymicFB&utm_medium=main&utm_campaign=social) have announced they have created a new bio-degrable plastic based on, of all things, shrimp shells.

We have [posted for several years](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/08/expedition-sets-sail-to-the-great-plastic-vortex/) now about the vast floating collection of trash in the Pacific Ocean. It goes by a variety of names including the [plastic vortex](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/08/expedition-sets-sail-to-the-great-plastic-vortex/) and the great [Pacific garbage patch](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/the-eastern-pacific-garbage-patch-how-big-really/).  It is held together by the circular current, the [North Pacific Gyre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre). Similar [garbage patches have formed in the Atlantic](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/04/10188/) and Indian Oceans.  The floating plastic is often deadly to sea birds, fish and whales which inject the trash.  Once tossed in the oceans, the [plastic simply does not go away](http://5gyres.org/what_is_the_issue/the_problem/).

Recently an [international study](http://phys.org/news/2014-04-european-seafloor-survey-reveals-depth.html) involving 15 organisations across Europe, led by the University of the Azores completed a survey of the seafloor which found bottles, plastic bags, fishing nets and other types of human litter even in the deepest ocean depths. In the survey, plastic accounted for 41% of the trash observed.

The problem with plastic in the oceans will only get worse unless a workable alternative is found. [Researchers at Harvard University’s Wyss Institute](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/05/promising-solution-to-plastic-pollution/) have developed a process using chitosan, a form of chitin, from shrimp shells to create a material that is strong, transparent and renewable. They’ve named it “[shrilk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrilk).”  Shrilk is thin, clear, flexible, and strong as aluminum at half the weight.

“*There is an urgent need in many industries for sustainable materials that can be mass produced,*” said Wyss director Donald E. Ingber. “*Our scalable manufacturing method shows that chitosan, which is readily available and inexpensive, can serve as a viable bioplastic that could potentially be used instead of conventional plastics for numerous industrial applications*.”

Not only is shrilk biodegrade, but once it’s discarded, it can be used as a fertilizer, releasing nutrients into the environment as it breaks down.
