Failing Acoustic Tiles on USS Virginia

Aren’t all submarines supposed to be stealthy?  I suppose some are stealthier than others.  The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong is reporting concerns by China’s neighbors that [China may have already built a stealth submarine](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/10/04/2010100400811.html).  On the other side of the world, the acoustic urethane tiles on the US Navy’s [Virginia Class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_class_submarine) attack submarines have been flaking off at sea. The tiles are believed to  dampen sound from the subs and make them more “stealthy,”  at least until they fall off.
