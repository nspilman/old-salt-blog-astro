Last summer, [Yachting Magazine](http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/specials/524521/crash-test-boat) began a monthly series of articles focused on a second-hand 40ft Jeanneau Sun Fizz 40 ketch, which they referred to as their “[Crash Test Boat](http://youtu.be/DPb5AV7BaD4).”   They proceeded to [capsize](http://youtu.be/Gqe1Sxa2GXo) the boat, [dismast](http://youtu.be/d-jqwkNXMIY) her, [cut holes](http://youtu.be/H5PDuXvqL7c) in her, set her on [fire](http://youtu.be/aL_VdzjM-24) and finally to [blow her up](http://youtu.be/Yxm3uMy6MPI). The intent wasn’t doing damage for damage’s sake but to give viewers an idea of what can happen in a dire situation, how to react and potentially how to avoid it.  The episodes are both educational and scarily fun at the same time. After effectively destroying the boat – the LPG explosion did the trick – the “Crash Test Boat” made her final appearance at the [London Boat Show](http://youtu.be/eOPxh86uvfQ) in January.  There is even an [Crash Test Boat iPad App](http://youtu.be/JQwxOWpwC60).

Everything is well documented on the [Yachting Magazine Youtube channel.](http://www.youtube.com/user/YachtingMonthly)  Here is one of my favorites.  After intentionally [dismasting](http://youtu.be/d-jqwkNXMIY) the boat while sailing in winds over 30 knots, they set about to rig a jury rig using materials available onboard.
