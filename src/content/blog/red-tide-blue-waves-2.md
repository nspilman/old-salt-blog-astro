With the advent of climate change [red tide](https://scijinks.gov/red-tide/) outbreaks have grown more frequent. A red tide occurs when certain types of algae grow out of control. The name “red tide” comes from the fact that overgrowth of algae can cause the color of the water to turn red, (as well as green or brown.) Red tides can be hazardous to human health and sea life.

Some, though not all, red tides can be bioluminescent, putting on an amazing light show that turns the ocean waves a vivid neon blue.  A few years back, an outbreak of red tide off Newport Beach, California discolored the Pacific waters during daylight and then, once the sun had set, exploded into a blue light when stirred by the action of the waves. A [trio of photographers](https://www.orangecountyoutdoors.com/) captured the display. To see more check out their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_ELxMtp6iS/).

Red tides and blue waves have been occurring on the California coast for a number of years. Here is a video from San Diego in 2014.
