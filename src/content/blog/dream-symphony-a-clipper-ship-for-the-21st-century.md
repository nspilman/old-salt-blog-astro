![dreamsymphony](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/08/dreamsymphony.jpg)When delivered sometime in 2016*, [Dream Symphony](http://www.yachtworld.com/boat-content/2014/07/dream-symphony-worlds-largest-sailing-yacht/)* will be a clipper ship for the 21st century. Like the 19th century clippers, *Dream Symphony* will carry an impressive cloud of sail and like the clippers, it will be built of wood.  That alone is remarkable as *Dream Symphony* is 462’7″ft (141m) long. Historically, wooden vessels could not be built longer than around 300′ long.

Conventional carvel planked wooden construction was just too flexible for longer ships. The longest schooner ever built was the *[Wyoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_\(schooner\)),* which was 350′ on deck. Despite being heavily strapped with iron, the ship flexed and twisted in heavy seas, opening her seams and requiring constant pumping to keep her dry.

To avoid the traditional limitations of wooden vessels, *Dream Symphony* is built of glued layers of wood laminates. The whole structure is highly engineered and the product of extensive finite element modeling. The wood/epoxy laminates are also protected by fiberglass on the outer hull surfaces.

Unlike the clipper ships of the 19th century, *Dream Symphony* is a fore and aft rigged four masted staysail schooner. She will set 5,000 square meters of sail, which is impressive when compared to clippers of the 1800s. The clipper *Cutty Sark,* for example, set 2,976 square meters of canvas.

*Dream Symphony* was designed and engineered by [Dykstra Naval Architects](http://www.dykstra-na.nl/). The interior and exterior design work was done by [Ken Freivokh Design](http://www.freivokh.co.uk/projects/#/141m-sy-dream-symphony).  The yacht in nearing completion at the [Dream Ship Victory](http://www.dsv-yachts.com/) yard, in Turkey.

When completed *Dream Symphony* will be the second largest sailing yacht in the world, behind the  147 meter long *White Pearl*, which is also being delivered in 2016.  *White Pearl* will have three masts and will carry a [Dyna-rig](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/07/the-return-of-commercial-sail-dyna-rig-design-in-the-news/), similar to the *[Maltese Falcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Falcon_\(yacht\))*.

Modern sailing mega-yachts differ from the clippers of old in that they are all rich mens’ toys. At the very least, however, they continue to develop the technology of sailing, in advance of the day when commercial sailing ships may again return to the world’s oceans.
