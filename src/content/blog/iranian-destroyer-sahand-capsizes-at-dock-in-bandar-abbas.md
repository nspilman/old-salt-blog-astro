![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sahand.jpg)The Iranian [Moudge-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moudge-class_frigate) destroyer *[Sahand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIS_Sahand_\(2012\))* capsized and sank in shallow water while undergoing dockside repairs in its home port of Bandar Abbas. The 1,300-tonne ship, commissioned in 2018, is one of the newest Iranian-built warships, fitted with surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, as well as anti-aircraft batteries and sophisticated radar and radar-evading capabilities.

“As *Sahand* was being repaired at the wharf, it lost its balance due to water ingress. Fortunately… the vessel is being returned to balance quickly,” IRNA news service reported, citing a navy statement.

Maritime security analyst [H.I. Sutton wrote](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/07/iranian-warship-sahand-capsizes-and-sinks/) on Sunday that the *Sahand* may have had a higher center of gravity due to recent upgrades, which could have affected its stability. The warship was fitted with a new radar, surface-to-air missiles, and more anti-ship missiles.

Poor maintenance or a docking accident were the most likely causes of the incident, Sutton said, although he could not rule out that the warship was sabotaged.

The *Sahand* is not the first Moudge-class destroyer to suffer a major casualty. Her sister ship *Damavand* capsized and sank after running aground on January 10, 2018. Another sister ship, *Talayieh*, rolled over in a dry dock in Bandar Abbas on December 6, 2021.
