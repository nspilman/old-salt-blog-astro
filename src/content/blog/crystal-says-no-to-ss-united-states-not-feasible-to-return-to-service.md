![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ssus2.jpg)Last February we posted “[Will the SS United States Sail Again? Crystal Cruises Tosses a Life Line.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/02/will-the-ss-united-states-sail-again-crystal-cruises-tosses-a-life-line/)”  [Crystal Cruises](http://www.crystalcruises.com/) had signed an [option to purchase the ship](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/business/ss-united-states-historic-ocean-liner-of-trans-atlantic-heyday-may-sail-again.html?_r=0) and was undertaking a feasibility study to determine whether the ship could be economically put back into service. In the mean time, Crystal Cruises would cover the ship expenses of $60,0000 per month for nine months. The feasibility study is now complete and Crystal Cruises has said, “Thank you, but no thank you.” From the press release: “*Crystal Cruises today determined that while the SS United States is structurally sound, the technical and commercial challenges associated with returning the historic liner to service as a modern cruise ship have unfortunately proven insurmountable.*”  While Crustal Cruises will not exercise their option to buy the ship, they will contribute $350,000 to aid in the [SS Unted States Conservancy](http://www.ssusc.org/)’s ongoing mission to save the ship.

Why wasn’t the ship attractive enough to Crystal Cruises? It would have been a very difficult restoration/conversion. As [we wrote last February](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/02/will-the-ss-united-states-sail-again-crystal-cruises-tosses-a-life-line/):

If Crystal Cruises moves forward, they have a huge job ahead of them…. SS *United States* operated from 1952-1969. In 1984, the ship’s interior, including furniture and fitting, was sold at auction. In 1994, what was left of the interior was stripped out when the ship’s asbestos was removed in a Turkish shipyard. … All of the ship’s mechanical and electrical systems will need to be replaced. All cable, electrical equipment such as capacitors and transformers,  as well as gaskets. which contain toxic PCBs, will have to be removed and disposed of.

Crystal Cruises would essentially be buying the shell of a historic ship, which could, at least potentially, make the conversion to a modern cruise ship easier. The plan is to keep the iconic profile. As reported by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/business/ss-united-states-historic-ocean-liner-of-trans-atlantic-heyday-may-sail-again.html?_r=0): *A concept rendering of the S.S. United States makeover shows a ship with its signature twin red, white and blue stacks and the same number of decks, a spokesman said, in contrast with the top-heavy silhouette of some modern cruise liners.* *The decks, however, are extended and expanded to accommodate rooms with balconies, something the original design never had.*
