Today is third day of hearings by the US Coast Guard on the sinking of the *[HMS Bounty](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/10/cnn-three-crew-swept-overboard-from-sinking-bounty-only-one-made-it-to-the-liferaft-search-continues-for-the-missing/)* on October 29, 2012, with loss of crew member Claudene Christian and Captain Robin Walbridge.  The hearings will continue in Portsmouth VA through February 21st.  Highlights of the hearings so far include the owner of the ship, Robert Hansen’s refusal to testify by invoking his Fifth Amendment rights on Tuesday.  Yesterday, Todd Kosakowski, a project manager at Boothbay Harbor Shipyard in Maine, testified that d\\rot was found on some of the ship’s framing while replacing planks. The extent of the rot in rest of the hull frames could not be determined with removing more planking which was not done.
