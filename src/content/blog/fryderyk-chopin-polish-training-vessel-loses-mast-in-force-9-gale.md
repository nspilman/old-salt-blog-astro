*The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said that the Fryderyk Chopin, a tall ship used to train young Polish sailors, is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southwest of Britain’s Isles of Scilly. The crew of 47 is mostly made up of 14-year-old cadets.*

The brig *Fryderyk Chopin,* a Polish sail training ship with 47 aboard, lost one of its two masts during a severe gale this morning  off the Isles of Scilly.
