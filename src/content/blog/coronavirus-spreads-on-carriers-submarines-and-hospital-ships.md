Charles de Gaulle

We have been following the [spread of the coronavirus on the aircraft carrier USS *Theodore Roosevelt*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/04/first-sailor-from-uss-theodore-roosevelt-dies-from-coronavirus/), where almost 600 sailors, including the captain, who was fired for speaking out about the spread, have tested positive for the virus. One crew member on the Roosevelt has died from the infection. Three other US aircraft carriers have reports of crew testing positive, as well.

Now the [BBC reports](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52308073) that a third of the sailors serving with France’s aircraft carrier [*Charles de Gaulle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_aircraft_carrier_Charles_de_Gaulle) – 668 out of nearly 2,000 – are infected with the coronavirus. Nearly all of those infected are on the carrier itself. An escorting frigate and carrier pilots are also in quarantine.

The carrier returned to the French port of Toulon early from Atlantic exercises. Twenty sailors have been hospitalized, with one in intensive care. The infection total is likely to rise, as 30% of test results are not yet in.

The infection has not just been limited to surface ships. At least eight of the 58 member crew of the Dutch submarine [MS *Dolfijn*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Dolfijn_\(1990\)) tested positive for the virus after coming down with flu-like symptoms. The submarine cut short its North Sea mission by two weeks and returned to its base in Den Helder.

Last month, the [crews of two Russian submarines](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/32802/entire-crew-of-a-russian-nuclear-submarine-is-in-quarantine-after-covid-19-exposure) and a support vessel were put in quarantine after being exposed to a civilian contractor believed to have the virus. One of the submarines was the *Orel*, an Oscar II class guided missile submarine. There are no reports on whether any of the crews were infected by the contact.

In the US, both Navy hospital ships have had crew who tested positive for the virus. Shortly after arriving in New York harbor, a [crew member on the USNS *Comfort* tested positive for the virus.](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2020/04/07/first-case-of-coronavirus-confirmed-among-crew-of-hospital-ship-comfort/)

On the West Coast, seven crew members aboard the USNS *Mercy* hospital ship, docked at the port of Los Angeles, have tested positive for coronavirus. “[Two crewmembers had minimal contact](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/military/infected-usns-mercy-crew-members-had-contact-with-patients-navy-says/2306268/) with a very small number of patients, and both were wearing the proper personal protective equipment during those interactions,” the Navy said in a statement. The Navy subsequently removed [116 medical staff members](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/navy-removes-126-hospital-ship-virus-infects-70146712) from the ship. The staff were moved to a military base where they were put into quarantine.
