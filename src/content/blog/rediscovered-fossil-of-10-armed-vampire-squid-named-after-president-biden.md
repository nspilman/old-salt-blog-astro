[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/17/1086778884/how-a-fossil-with-10-arms-and-named-after-joe-biden-changed-the-vampire-squid-ga) reports that researchers say they have found the oldest known relative of octopuses and vampire squids, in a fossil dug up decades ago in Montana.

The official name of the newly discovered species is *Syllipsimopodi bideni*, named after President Joe Biden, in a nod to what the researchers say is his embrace of science.

The well-preserved 328-million-year-old fossil was discovered in Montana’s Bear Gulch Limestone in 1988, but it hasn’t been closely studied until now.

The creature is a vampyropod — a soft-bodied creature in the group that also contains octopuses and vampire squid.

But unlike both of those creatures, this newly described species has 10 arms — the only known vampyropod to do so, according to [new research published in the journal Nature Communications.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28333-5)

President Biden is not the only resident of the Oval Office to have a newly identified species named after him. In 2018, a newly discovered [blind and burrowing amphibian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/18/blind-amphibian-named-after-trumps-climate-change-stance) was officially named *Dermophis donaldtrumpi*, in recognition of the twice impeached former US president’s climate change denial.
