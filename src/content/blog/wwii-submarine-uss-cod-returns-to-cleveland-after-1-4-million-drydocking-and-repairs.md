![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/usscod.jpg)Tomorrow, the [Gato Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gato-class_submarine) submarine [USS *Cod*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cod) commissioned in 1943, will be towed back to its dock in Cleveland, OH following a $1.4 million drydocking at [Donjon Shipbuilding](https://donjonshipbuilding.com/) in Erie, PA. While on dock, the 78-year old submarine had ballast tank plating renewed, refurbished torpedo tubes installed, and received a fresh coat of paint. A Cleveland homecoming celebration is planned for Sunday, August 22 at 1PM.

*Cod* is credited with sinking more than 12 enemy vessels totaling more than 37,000 tons, and damaging another 36,000 tons of enemy shipping. All seven of her war patrols were considered successful and *Cod* was awarded seven battle stars for her service in World War II.

USS *Cod* has served as a [museum ship in Cleveland](https://usscod.org/) since 1976. *Cod* is considered to be one of the finest restored submarines on display and is the only U.S. submarine that has not had stairways and doors cut into her pressure hull for public access. The ship is open daily between 1 May and 30 September of each year from 1000 to 1700 hours.
