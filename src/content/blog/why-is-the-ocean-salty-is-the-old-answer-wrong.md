I remember when I was quite young, I asked the question, “Why is the ocean salty?” We had just visited my grandparents in Florida and I had discovered first hand just how salty the seawater in the Gulf of Mexico could be.  I was told that salt dissolves in water and is carried to the oceans by rivers, so that over time the sea keeps getting saltier.  It seemed like a good answer to me, so I moved on other questions.

Recently, however, I heard [Robert Ballard](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Robert_Ballard), the famous oceanographer and underwater archaeologist of *T[itanic](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/searching-for-the-uss-thresher-and-uss-scorpion-with-the-titanic-as-cover/)* [and *Thresher* fame](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/searching-for-the-uss-thresher-and-uss-scorpion-with-the-titanic-as-cover/), say that, until recently, oceanographers did not know why the ocean was salty. They didn’t know until 1979 to be exact. The problem is that the old explanation, that salt was carried in from the rivers, didn’t quite work. The chemistry of the oceans and the chemistry of the rivers were different enough to suggest that something else was going on. Here is [Ballard explaining their discovery on National Geographic](http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/campfire-stories/150605-sciex-campfire-stories-ballard-salty?utm_source=NatGeocom&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=inside_20150618&utm_campaign=Content#editors-favorites).

The [United States Geological Service answer to the question](http://water.usgs.gov/edu/whyoceansalty.html) is a bit more detailed and involves both rivers, vents and volcanoes:

***From precipitation to the land to the rivers to the sea***

*The rain that falls on the land contains some dissolved carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic due to carbonic acid. The rain physically erodes the rock and the acids chemically break down the rocks and carries salts and minerals along in a dissolved state as ions. The ions in the runoff are carried to the streams and rivers and then to the ocean. Many of the dissolved ions are used by organisms in the ocean and are removed from the water. Others are not used up and are left for long periods of time where their concentrations increase over time.*

*The two ions that are present most often in seawater are chloride and sodium. These two make up over 90% of all dissolved ions in seawater. By the way, the concentration of salt in seawater (salinity) is about 35 parts per thousand. In other words, about 35 of 1,000 (3.5%) of the weight of seawater comes from the dissolved salts; in a cubic mile of seawater the weight of the salt, as sodium chloride, would be about 120 million tons. And, just so you don’t think seawater is worthless, a cubic mile of it also can contain up to 25 pounds of gold (at a concentration of 0.000005 parts per million). Before you go out and try alchemy on seawater, though, just think about how big a cubic mile is (1 cubic mile contains 1,101,117,147,000 gallons!).*

***Salt comes up from below, too***

*Rivers and surface runoff are not the only source of dissolved salts. Hydrothermal vents are recently-discovered features on the crest of oceanic ridges that contribute dissolved minerals to the oceans. These vents are the exit point on the ocean floor from which sea water that has seeped into the rocks of the oceanic crust has become hotter, has dissolved some of the minerals from the crust, and then flows back into the ocean. With the hot water comes large amounts of dissolved minerals. Estimates of the amount of hydrothermal fluids now flowing from these vents indicate that the entire volume of the oceans could seep through the oceanic crust in about 10 million years. Thus, this process has a very important effect on salinity. The reactions between seawater and oceanic basalt, the rock of ocean crust, are not one-way, however; some of the dissolved salts react with the rock and are removed from seawater.*

*A final process that provides salts to the oceans is submarine volcanism, the eruption of volcanoes under water. This is similar to the previous process in that seawater is reacting with hot rock and dissolving some of the mineral constituents.*
