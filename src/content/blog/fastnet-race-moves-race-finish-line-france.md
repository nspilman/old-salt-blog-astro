![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rolexfastnet.jpg)The [Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC)](http://www.rorc.org/news/news-2019/royal-ocean-racing-club-to-finish-the-rolex-fastnet-race-in-cherbourg), organizers of the Rolex Fastnet Race, announced that the City of Cherbourg will host the finish of the Rolex Fastnet Race for the 2021 and 2023 editions of the biennial race.  The race, first sailed in 1925, had previously departed from Cowes on the Isle of Wight and returned to Plymouth in the UK after rounding Fastnet Rock, off the southern coast of Ireland.

The RORC justified the change by saying that it will open the race to more competitors. The 2019 Rolex Fastnet Race had 388 yachts on the start line from 27 different nations, with a waiting list of 150 yachts. 

Plymouth City Council said it was “beyond disappointed”.

[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-50570948) quotes RORC Commodore, Steven Anderson, saying: “We have had to limit entries in recent years because of berthing constraints, but Cherbourg offers significant additional berthing and improved facilities for competitors, so we will be able to … give more sailors the opportunity to compete in this very special race.”

Royal Western Yacht Club Commodore Chris Arscott said changing the route made it a different race, which arguably should not be called Fastnet.

Mr. Arscott said his club has hosted the finish since 1925 and added there had been some backlash among competitors.

“To me, it is about the tradition of the whole thing, it is not about the commercialization,” he said.

The move of the finish line to Cherbourg, France will add 90 nautical miles to the previous 608-mile course. The race will also cross the English Channel, which is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.
