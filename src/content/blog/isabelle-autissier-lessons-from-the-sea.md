[Isabelle Autissier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelle_Autissier) is a French sailor who has sailed around the world four times. In this [TED talk](http://tedxwwf.com/), she shares some of what she has learned about life and living from the sailing the world’s oceans. She speaks of the importance of observing, understanding, and adapting to what nature gives, rather than trying to overpower the forces of the natural world.  Definitely worth watching.
