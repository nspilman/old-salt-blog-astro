“To pay tribute to the USS *Lexington* and the brave men that served on her is an honor,” said billionaire and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. “As Americans, all of us owe a debt of gratitude to everyone who served and who continue to serve our country for their courage, persistence, and sacrifice.”

The USS *Lexington* (CV2) was the second aircraft carrier ever commissioned by the US Navy. Originally designed as a battlecruiser, she was converted into an aircraft carrier during construction to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The carrier entered service in 1928 and served in the Pacific until she sank on May 8, 1942.

This is the third major World War II combatant found by Paul Allen and his team on the [R/V *Petrel*](https://www.paulallen.com/tag/petrel/) in the last three years.  In August 2017, Allen announced that they had located the wreckage of the cruiser [USS *Indianapolis*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/08/lost-world-war-ii-cruiser-uss-indianapolis-found-philippine-sea-billionaire-paul-allen/) sunk in 1945.  In 2015, after eight years of searching, a team led by Paul Allen discovered the wreck of the [Japanese battleship *Musashi*,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/03/musashi-last-japanese-ww-ii-battleship-found/) sunk in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944.
