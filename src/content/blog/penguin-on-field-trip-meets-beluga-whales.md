And now, for something completely different. While Chicago’s [Shedd Aquarium](https://www.sheddaquarium.org/) has been closed to visitors, the aquarium has allowed its penguins to take ‘field trips’ inside the facility. Here is a short video of Wellington, a [rockhopper penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockhopper_penguin), coming face to face with three beluga [whales,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_whale) Kayavak, Mauyak, and baby Annik. The whales appeared to be very interested in the penguin and vice versa. Given that penguins are native to the Southern Hemisphere and belugas are found only in the north, this may be one of the few interactions between the two species.
