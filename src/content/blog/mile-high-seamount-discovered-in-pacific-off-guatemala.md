![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/semount.jpg)There is an old saying that we know more about the Moon than we do about the deep ocean. [Critics say that the notion, first recorded in 1954, is out of date](https://www.astronomy.com/science/do-we-know-more-about-the-moon-than-the-deep-sea-no/). While that may be the case, it is also clear that we still have much to learn about the deep ocean. 

Recently, scientists on the [*Falkor (too)*](https://schmidtocean.org/rv-falkor/) research vessel have discovered a mile-high mountain in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Guatemala. The 5,250-foot-tall (1,600 meters) formation is a seamount — a large, underwater geological feature typically formed from an extinct volcano. Scientists discovered the cone-shaped seamount 7,870 feet (2,400 m) below sea level during an expedition organized by the [Schmidt Ocean Institute](https://schmidtocean.org/) this summer, according to a statement shared with [Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/geology/seamount-twice-the-size-of-worlds-tallest-building-discovered-hidden-under-the-waves).

What difference does the discovery of a seamount make? Beyond the value of understanding oceanic bathymetry, uncharted seamounts can be hazards to navigation. In October of 2021, the Seawolf Class submarine, [USS *Connecticut*, collided with an uncharted seamount](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/05/report-uss-connecticut-seamount-grounding-was-preventable/) in the South China Sea, doing considerable damage to the sub.

Also in April of this year, the 72′ [Saildrone Surveyor discovered a 3,300-foot-tall seamount](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2023/04/saildrone-surveyor-usv-discovers-a-3300-foot-tall-seamount-off-california-coast/), about 200 miles off the coast of California.  

How many more seamounts are yet to be discovered? Apparently, quite a few. In April, results of images from [high-definition radar satellites revealed more than 19,000 undersea volcanoe](https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/rivers-oceans/mind-boggling-array-of-19000-undersea-volcanoes-discovered-with-high-resolution-radar-satellites)s around our planet, providing scientists with the most comprehensive catalog of seamounts ever created.
