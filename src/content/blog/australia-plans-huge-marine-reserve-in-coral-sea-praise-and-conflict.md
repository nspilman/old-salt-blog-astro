If approved, the Coral Sea reserve, would be approximately 989,842 sq km. While environmentalists have praised the move, the Australian fishing industry has condemned the reserve as unnecessary pointing to a the [recent release of a government report showing that more than 90 per cent of fish stocks are sustainable](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/fish-protection-not-necessary-industry/story-fn59niix-1226534855402).  On the other hand, earlier this year a [UNESCO report concluded that Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is under imminent threat](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2012/06/04/2003534498) from industrial development and may be considered for listing as a world heritage site “in danger” within the next year.
