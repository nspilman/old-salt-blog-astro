[![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mpelicanrotors.jpg)Testing has begun](https://maersktankers.com/media/testing-begins-on-first-product-tanker-vessel-utilising-wind-propulsion-technology) on the recently installed rotor sails on the [MV *Maersk Pelican*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:730851/mmsi:565686000/imo:9319686/vessel:MAERSK_PELICAN). The two large cylinders installed on the deck of the 110,000 DWT Long Range 2 product tanker may not look much like sails but may represent the future of sail assist technology in commercial shipping. The 30 meter tall and 5 meter in diameter rotors, the world’s largest, are a modern version of the Flettner rotor developed in the 1920s. When the rotors are spun in a wind, they develop lift which can be used to propel a ship or to reduce the fuel consumed by the main engines. The rotor sails on the *Maersk Pelican* are expected to reduce fuel consumption by 7 to 10% on average.

The rotor sails were provided by Norsepower Oy Ltd.,  working with project partners Maersk Tankers, Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) and Shell Shipping & Maritime.

“This project is breaking ground in the product tanker industry. While the industry has gone through decades of technological development, the use of wind propulsion technology onboard a product tanker vessel could take us to a new playing field. This new technology has the potential to help the industry be more cost-competitive as it moves cargoes around the world for customers and to reduce the environmental impact,” said Tommy Thomassen, Chief Technical Officer, Maersk Tankers.

*Maersk Pelican* is the third ship with Norsepower Oy rotors installed. In 2015, [Bore Line](https://www.bore.eu/) had a single rotor installed on its Ro/Ro [MV *Estraden*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/01/flettner-fleet-doubles-in-size-mv-estraden-adds-a-rotor/). Pleased with the results, they had a second rotor installed in 2016.  This year the LNG powered cruise ferry *[Viking Grace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Viking_Grace) became* the [first passenger vessel to install a rotor sail](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/04/cruise-ferry-viking-grace-latest-to-install-rotor-sail/).

The longest running modern rotor ship is the 10,000 DWT Ro/Lo [*E Ship 1*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/e-ship-1-has-the-flettner-rotor-ship-finally-arrived/), owned by Enercon. With four rotors, fuel savings averaging 25% have been reported.
