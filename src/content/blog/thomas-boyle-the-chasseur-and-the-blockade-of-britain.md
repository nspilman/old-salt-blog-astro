Captain Thomas Boyle

Today in 1775 in Marblehead, Massachusetts, [Thomas Boyle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Boyle) was born.  Going to sea at age 10, he would become one of the most successful and most famous privateering captains in the War of 1812.  After several successful cruises as captain of the sharp-built “Baltimore clipper” *Comet,* Boyle took over command of the brig *[Chasseur](http://maryland1812.wordpress.com/category/privateers/chasseur/)*, reported to be on of the fastest vessels of the time.   In 1814, he slipped through the British naval blockade of New York and sailed for Britain, where he took 18 merchant ships in three months.  
  
In addition to his other skills, Boyle was not lacking in audacity.  In response to the British blockade of America, Boyle issued a proclamation declaring that he and the *Chasseur* were putting the entirety of the British Isles “ *in a state of strict and rigorous blockade.”* He had the proclamation printed and posted in Lloyd’s Coffee House in London, then the center of the British insurance industry.  Insurance rates skyrocketed.  When Boyle and the *Chasseur* returned from their successful the *Chasseur* was dubbed “the Pride of Baltimore” by a local newspaper.  The current replica *[Pride of Baltimore II](http://www.pride2.org/index.php)* is modeled on sharp-built privateers like the *Chasseur.*

**Boyle ‘s Proclamation*:***

*Whereas, It has become customary with the admirals of Great Britain, commanding small forces on the coast of the United States, particularly with Sir John Borlaise Warren and Sir Alexander Cochrane, to declare all the coast of the said United States in a state of strict and rigorous blockade without possessing the power to justify such a declaration or stationing an adequate force to maintain said blockade;*

*I do therefore, by virtue of the power and authority in me vested (possessing sufficient force), declare all the ports, harbors, bays, creeks, rivers, inlets, outlets, islands, and seacoast of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in a state of strict and rigorous blockade. And I do further declare that I consider the force under my command adequate to maintain strictly, rigorously, and effectually the said blockade.*

*And I do hereby require the respective officers, whether captains, commanders, or commanding officers, under my command, employed or to be employed, on the coasts of England, Ireland, and Scotland, to pay strict attention to the execution of this my proclamation.*

*And I do hereby caution and forbid the ships and vessels of all and every nation in amity and peace with the United States from entering or attempting to enter, or from coming or attempting to come out of, any of the said ports, harbors, bays, creeks, rivers, inlets, outlets, islands, or seacoast under any pretense whatsoever. And that no person may plead ignorance of this, my proclamation, I have ordered the same to be made public in England. Given under my hand on board the Chasseur. THOMAS BOYLE By command of the commanding officer.  
*
