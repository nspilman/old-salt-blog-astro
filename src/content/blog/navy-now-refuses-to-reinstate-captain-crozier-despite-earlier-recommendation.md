![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/04/crozier.jpg)The US government has now reversed the recommendation made by high ranking Navy officials that Capt. Brett Crozier, commander of the aircraft carrier [USS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Theodore_Roosevelt_\(CVN-71\)) *[Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Theodore_Roosevelt_\(CVN-71\)),* be reinstated.  

In April, the coronavirus was [spreading out of control on the aircraft carrier USS *Theodore Roosevelt.*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/04/first-sailor-from-uss-theodore-roosevelt-dies-from-coronavirus/)  When a letter he wrote seeking help for his ship’s crew was leaked to the press, Captain Crozier was fired. Notwithstanding his dismissal, the Navy acted on Capt. Crozier’s recommendations and requests. 

In late April, the [Navy reviewed the firing and recommended that Captain Crozier be reinstated](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/04/navy-recommends-reinstating-fired-roosevelt-captain/). Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday presented the recommendations to the acting secretary of the Navy James McPherson who forwarded them to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. Esper chose not to accept the recommendations and reopened the investigation, which was supposed to be finished by May.

Now in late June, the [Navy has reversed its position and has decided not to reinstate Captain Crozier](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/19/navy-fires-brett-crozier-aircraft-carrier-coronavirus-329716?fbclid=IwAR2tdbt_g6-qvcEoq0DfhfRePLXwfJ67E-RBY6Sy_7_jzcrEcNSN_-jF0ys) but also to recommend additional administrative punishment. 

The Navy will also hold up the promotion of the senior officer onboard the Roosevelt, Rear Adm. Stuart Baker, the commander of Carrier Strike Group 9. The carrier air wing commander and the ship’s chief of medical operations will be referred for administrative action, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday announced.

Crozier will not be eligible for future command, effectively ending his Navy career.

After being fired, Captain Crozier was given [a rousing sendoff by the crew of the](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/04/sailors-cheer-carrier-captain-fired-by-navy-for-standing-up-for-crew-health-and-safety/) *Roosevelt* and is considered by many [active-duty Navy personnel and veterans](https://www.ajc.com/news/new-lawmakers-veterans-blast-navy-for-firing-captain-after-his-pleas-for-help/1YKv8zO0Fi4rRfoYqVFWII/) to be a hero for his willingness to sacrifice his career for the health of his sailors. Captain Crozier himself was infected wi the coronavirus and is recovering in isolation in Guam.

In the letter that got him fired, Crozier wrote, ““We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset – our sailors.”  Ultimately, [more than 1,000 sailors](https://news.usni.org/2020/04/17/more-than-1000-sailors-test-positive-for-covid-19-service-has-highest-share-of-active-duty-infections) in a crew of over 4,000 tested positive for the virus. One crew member died of COVID-19. 

The Trump political appointee, acting Navy secretary, Thomas B. Modly, who fired Captain Crozier,  [resigned under pressure](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/04/acting-secnav-modly-wildly-out-of-control/).
