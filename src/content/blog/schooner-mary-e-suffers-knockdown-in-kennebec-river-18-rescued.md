![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/08/marye.jpg)On Friday, the schooner [*Mary E*](https://www.instagram.com/p/CR_64PWt132/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=c7558f13-726b-4996-a685-870062ed94e2), owned by the [Maine Maritime Museum](https://www.mainemaritimemuseum.org/) in Bath, was knocked down and flooded while sailing off Doubling Point Light on the Kennebec River, just downriver from the museum. All 18 passengers and crew were rescued from the 73-foot schooner, pulled from the water by boats from Sea Tow, Bath Iron Works security, and good samaritans.

The schooner has now been recovered and returned to the museum dock. An investigation into the accident is ongoing.

On Friday, the schooner, advertised as “the only Kennebec-built schooner still afloat,” was scheduled for a river cruise from 4-6:30 p.m. that would take passengers past BIW, Doubling Point Lighthouse and the Kennebec Range Lights, according to the museum’s website.

The [Portland Press Herald](https://www.pressherald.com/2021/08/02/mary-e-back-at-bath-museum-after-capsizing-investigation-on-cause-ongoing/) reports that the two-masted schooner was built by Thomas Hagan in 1906 in a Houghton shipyard, where Bath Iron Works now stands. For 38 years the vessel was operated as a fishing and trade vessel out of Rhode Island. The ship was sold in 1944 to become a dragger until it was abandoned in 1960 and sank in Lynn Harbor, Massachusetts, after a hurricane on Thanksgiving 1963.

William Donnell of Bath – whose great-grandfather was a shipbuilder associated with Hagan – bought the vessel in 1965 for $200 and brought it back home for restoration. Following that two-year endeavor, the Mary E became a passenger vessel in the Maine Windjammer Fleet.

Maine Maritime Museum purchased the Mary E in early 2017 for $140,000 and uses it for cruises on the Kennebec River.
