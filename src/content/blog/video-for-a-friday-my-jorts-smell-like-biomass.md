After an lovely warm November, winter is beginning to settle in here on the banks of the Hudson River, so it feels like a good time to feature a video of warm water, blue sky and white sails. Here is a video shot by [Jimmy C](http://vimeo.com/user8057244) on-board the 134-foot steel brigantine *[Robert C. Seamans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Seamans_\(ship\))* on a thirty eight day voyage from San Diego to Honolulu with [S.E.A. Semester class S237](http://www.sea.edu/voyages/blog_seamans_237).  The video was shot with a [Go Pro Helmet cam](http://www.amazon.com/mn/search?_encoding=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&ie=UTF8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=gopro%20camera&url=search-alias%3Delectronics&sprefix=go%20pro%20camera%23).

[Sea Education Association (SEA)](http://www.sea.edu/) is a private, nonprofit educational organization which offers a hands-on experience to college and high school students in sailing at sea. They operate the *Robert C. Seamans*, generally in the Pacific, and the *[Corwith Cramer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corwith_Cramer_\(ship\))* in the Atlantic.
