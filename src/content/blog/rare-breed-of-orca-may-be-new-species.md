![orcatype](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/07/orcatype.jpg)The title of the paper published in the journal [Polar Biology](http://www.springer.com/life+sciences/ecology/journal/300) doesn’t help much, unless you are biologist. The paper is titled, “[Mitogenomic insights into a recently described and rarely observed killer whale morphotype](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-013-1354-0).” Lara Sorokanich writing in *National Geographic* translates the news into layman’s English. Her article is titled, “[Rare Breed of Killer Whale May Be New Species](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/06/130627-killer-whale-orca-new-species-animal-science?source=sailthru).” Scientists studying the skeleton of a rare type “D” orca now believe that the unusual type of orca may be its own species or at least a sub-species. As reported in [National Geographic](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/06/130627-killer-whale-orca-new-species-animal-science?source=sailthru):

*Scientists used a portion of the whale’s skeleton to map type D’s genome. They then compared their results with the genomes of the more common orcas—types A, B, and C—to determine the genetic differences among all four varieties.*

*The study revealed that type D’s genetic differences date back nearly 400,000 years. These ancient variations may qualify type D as an entirely new species or subspecies of killer whale, though further evidence will be needed before the proposal is confirmed.*
