*The behemoth Taiwanese oil skimmer, A Whale, is not yet ready attack the* *Gulf of Mexico oil spill* *after a weekend of testing proved inconclusive, said a statement this morning from TMT Shipping Offshore, owner of the ship.*  
  
*“After an initial 48-hour testing period, results remain inconclusive in light of the rough sea state we are encountering,” said Bob Grantham, spokesman for the company. “Over this same period, very few other skimmers have even been deployed. Therefore, working in close coordination with the US Coast Guard, we will be undertaking an additional testing period to make operational and technological adjustments aimed at improving skimming effectiveness given the actual conditions we are encountering in the Gulf.”*

*Grantham said officials expect conditions to improve on the Gulf soon. Being a newly developed tool to battle oil slicks, the A Whale, a 10-story-tall, 350-yard-long vessel, requires testing and adjustments before moving into action, he said.*
