A family of religious extremists was rescued from their damaged sailboat after becoming lost for many weeks in the Pacific and has been flown back to the United States.

In May, Sean and Hannah Gastonguay, with Sean’s father, Mike, and their 3-year-old and 8-month-old baby daughters, set sail from San Diego bound for the Pacific nation of Kiribati, a group of islands just off the equator and the international date line about halfway between Hawaii and Australia.

Hannah is quoted by the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/family-leaves-us-on-sailboat-over-religious-concerns-to-start-new-life-becomes-lost-at-sea/2013/08/10/c8826fd8-0208-11e3-8294-0ee5075b840d_story.html), saying that “*her family was fed up with government control in the U.S. As Christians they don’t believe in “abortion, homosexuality, in the state-controlled church,” she said….  Among other differences, she said they had a problem with being “forced to pay these taxes that pay for abortions we don’t agree with.”’*  (Ms. Gastonguay, 26, is apparently unaware that the US government has not funded abortion for close to 40 years, so it is unclear which taxes she is complaining about.)  Ms. Gastonguay also that she and her husband “*decided to take a leap of faith and see where God led us*.”  She also said that they wanted to go to Kiribati because “*we didn’t want to go anywhere big.*” She said they understood the island to be “*one of the least developed countries in the world.*”  Though not mentioned in the interview, both abortion and homosexuality are illegal in Kiribati.

Not long after setting sail, they encountered storms, suffered rigging damage and apparently got lost. After two months at sea they began to run low on supplies. They were ultimately rescued by a Venezuelan fishing vessel, then transferred to a Japanese cargo ship, which carried the family to Chile.  As reported by the Chilean newspaper *Las Ultimas Noticias,* police prefect Jose Luis Lopez, who took the family’s statement at San Antonio, commented, “*They were looking for a kind of adventure; they wanted to live on a Polynesian island but they didn’t have sufficient expertise to navigate adequately.*”

Religious zealotry proved to be no substitute for basic seamanship.
