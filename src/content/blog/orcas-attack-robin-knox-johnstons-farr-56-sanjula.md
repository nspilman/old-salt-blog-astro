Robin Knox-Johnston in 2013

More news of orcas attacking sailboats in the Atlantic off the Iberian peninsula, in this case involving a sailing icon. [Scuttlebutt Sailing News](https://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2022/11/27/orcas-attack-robin-knox-johnston/) reports that a pod of orcas attacked [Sir Robin Knox-Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Knox-Johnston) while sailing his Farr 56 *Sanjula*, damaging the steering. 

As the first person to perform a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation of the globe, and then later won the second Jules Verne Trophy, 83-year-old Robin Knox-Johnson is indeed sailing royalty.

Knox-Johnson recounted what happened to Scuttlebutt: On November 24 at 0835 GMT off the Spanish coast of Cape Finisterre (Lat 42 53.6N Long 009 30.3W), a pod of 7-10 Orcas surrounded my Farr 56 *Sanjula* and then began to barge into its rudder. This eventually broke a steering connecting rod.

The engine was switched off and the boat lay hove-to whilst the emergency steering was rigged. After ten minutes the Orcas moved away, no longer finding a hove-to yacht interesting … but that is only an assumption. The boat sailed to Vigo for repairs.

Since 2020, there have been some 236 reported interactions between orcas, also known as killer whales, and boats off the Iberian Peninsula, according to Spanish News Today.

There is no record of an orca killing a human in the wild. Still, two boats were reportedly sunk by orcas off the coast of Portugal this year, the most recent earlier this month.
