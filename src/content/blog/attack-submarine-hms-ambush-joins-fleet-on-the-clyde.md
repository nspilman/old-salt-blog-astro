With luck, HMS *Ambush* will not share the problems of the first of the class, HMS *Astute*, which has been described as [rustly, leaky and slow](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/11/more-woes-for-the-hms-astute-rusty-slow-leaky/).  The *Astute* suffered from [an embarrassing grounding](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/10/hms-astute-british-nuclear-submarine-aground-off-skye/), electrical and [hydraulic failures](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/05/hms-astute-towed-back-to-port-after-hydraulics-failure/), and a [murder](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/04/tragedy-on-the-hms-astute-update/) aboard ship.
