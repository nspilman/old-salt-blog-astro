Capture of H.M. Ships Cyane & Levant, by the U.S. Frigate Constitution

David Debias, was a free black youth from the north side of Beacon Hill in Boston. In 1814, at only 8 years old, he signed aboard the [USS *Constitution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution), nicknamed “Old Ironsides.” He was rated as a ship’s boy and was assigned as a servant to Master’s Mate Nathaniel G. Leighton. 

On the night of February 20, 1815, Debias served on USS *Constitution* during the battle in which *Old Ironsides* captured HMS *Cyane* and HMS *Levant*.

He sailed on board *Levant*, with Master’s Mate Leighton, as part of the prize crew.  *Levant* was subsequently captured by a British squadron on the way back to the United States and Debias and the rest of the prize crew were imprisoned in Barbados. With the end of the war in May, he returned home and was finally reunited with his family. His father collected $31.98 — the equivalent of roughly $550 today — for his young son’s seven months of service.

After signing off the USS *Constitution*, David Debias sailed on merchant ships for several years. In 1821, he reenlisted in the Navy and sailed again on the USS *Constitution* on a voyage to the Mediterranean. He returned to the United States in 1824 and rejoined the merchant marine.

In 1838, he left his ship in Mobile, Alabama, started walking north, and was picked up as a runaway slave in Winchester, Mississippi. His arrest caught the attention of a local lawyer named Thomas Falconer, who was convinced that Debias was a free man. Falconer wrote to the Secretary of the Navy seeking proof of Debais’ status. Falconer’s letter to the Secretary of the Navy pleads Debias’ case, describing his service to his country and requesting Debias’ naval records. The Secretary of the Navy complied with Falconer’s request and sent proof of Debias’ service.

There are no records of what became of David Debias. It is not unlikely that he was sold into slavery.  The courthouse, housing the records of what transpired, later burned to the ground.

David Debias could easily have been wholly forgotten were it not for the efforts of [Rashaun Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashaun-martin-0289aa1/), a life trustee of the museum and Boston Public Schools administrator. The [Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/08/metro/tale-revealed-8-year-old-veteran-uss-constitution/?s_campaign=breakingnews:newsletter) reports that Martin, a Navy veteran of the Korean and Vietnam wars, uncovered Debias as part of his efforts, begun years ago, to find as many of *Constitution*’s crew as possible. He’s up to 15,600 names, and the young Bostonian was among those who stood out.

“Every once in a while, you hit one that’s a little bit different and a little bit of an eye-catcher,” said Martin, who lives in Tryon, N.C.

[David Debias’ story is now featured in the USS Constitution Museum](https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/?s=David+Debias). 

David Debias is also [honored in music](http://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/07/15/african_american_sailors_story_comes_to_life_through_music/). In 2007, the Boston Landmarks Orchestra commissioned the work “[David and the Old Ironsides,](http://www.larrybellmusic.com/?p=1184)” based on the David Debias’ service aboard the USS Constitution.  

“As the story is being narrated, the orchestra plays music to accompany it,” said Charles Ansbacher, conductor and artistic director of the orchestra. “It’s like a children’s book with the music as illustrations. The music paints the picture. If in the story they are getting ready for battle, the music will represent the anxiety in the air.”

The narrative for “David and the Old Ironsides” was written by Constance Leeds, a retired lawyer who has also published a book for young adults. The music was composed by [Larry Bell](http://www.larrybellmusic.com/?p=1184), who teaches at the New England Conservatory. The first performance was at the Charlestown Navy Yard, in front of the USS *Constitution.*
