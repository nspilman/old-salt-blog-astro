![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/03/OLDEST-BIRD-IN-AMERICA-100x91.jpg)Last week [we posted about a Laysan albatross](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/10/the-oldest-albatross-a-mother-at-60/), nicknamed Wisdom, who, at at least 60, is the oldest known wild bird and who also recently became a mother again, delivering a healthy chick.   The BBC has now reported that while the tsunami killed thousands of albatrosses and other endangered species at a wildlife sanctuary north-west of Hawaii,  Wisdom was among the survivors.  Perhaps that shouldn’t be too surprising.  She is one tough old bird.
