In response to our post, [Bon Voyage to the Barque Picton Castle – Bound for the South Pacific](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/11/03/bon-voyage-to-the-barque-picton-castle-bound-for-the-south-pacific/), Diego commented, “Farewell to Nova Scotia, the sea-bound coast,”  which is the first line of the chorus of the old sailor’s song, *Farewell to Nova Scotia*.   Since reading his comment I haven’t been able to get the song out of my head, so I figure I might was well share.   In honor of the barque *[Picton Castle](http://www.picton-castle.com/)* sailing from Nova Scotia bound out for the South Pacific, here is Bonnie Dobson singing *Farewell to Nova Scotia.*
