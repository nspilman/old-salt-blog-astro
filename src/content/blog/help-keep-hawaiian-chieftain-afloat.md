Hawaiian Chieftain

[Grays Harbor Historical Seaport Authority](http://historicalseaport.org/about-us/ghhsa/) of Washington State, owns and operates two tall ships, [*Lady Washington*](http://historicalseaport.org/about-us/our-vessels/lady-washington/) and [*Hawaiian Chieftain*](http://historicalseaport.org/about-us/our-vessels/hawaiian-chieftain/). In the past five years they have introduced over 42,000 school children to tall ship sailing and program up and down the entire West Coast and have a stated goal or reaching ten times that number in the years to come as well as continuing to train new tall ship sailors. They are now attempting to raise funds through crowd-sourcing to support a major upgrading of the *[Hawaiian Chieftain](http://historicalseaport.org/about-us/our-vessels/hawaiian-chieftain/).* 

Built of steel in Hawaii in 1988, *Hawaiian Chieftain* was originally designed for cargo trade among the Hawaiian Islands. Naval architect Raymond H. Richards’ design was influenced by the early colonial passenger and coastal packets that traded among Atlantic coastal cities and towns. Grays Harbor Historical Seaport purchased *Hawaiian Chieftain* in 2005.  The ship often sails in company with *Lady Washington,* engaging in their extremely popular “battle cruises” where they fire black power ships’ guns in mock naval combat.

Their goal is to raise $50,000. [Click here to donate and/or to learn more.](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-keep-hawaiian-chieftain-afloat)
