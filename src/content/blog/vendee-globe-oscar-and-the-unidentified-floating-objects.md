![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vg200.jpg)At roughly this point in the last sailing of the Vendee Globe in 2016-2017, [5 boats had been forced to retire](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/12/cluttered-ocean-ufos-vendee-globe/) after being damaged by collisions with UFOs, unidentified floating objects.

In this year’s race, 18 of the 33 boats competing are carrying a new high-tech collision avoidance package dubbed [OSCAR](https://marineindustrynews.co.uk/18-vendee-globe-competitors-fitted-with-oscar-ai/). The electronics package, installed at the boat’s masthead, uses day and thermal cameras combined with artificial intelligence, to provide a second set of ‘eyes’ for the solo skipper both day and night. 

How well has OSCAR worked so far? It may still be too soon to judge. That being said, of the 4 racing boats damaged by UFOs in the current race, at least two had OSCAR units installed.

Sam Davies, on *Initiatives Coeur,* was sailing at 15-20 knots when the boat’s keel struck something underwater and came to a sudden and complete stop. [Structural damage forced Davies to retire](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/12/vendee-globe-sam-davies-out-of-the-game-with-plans-to-keep-sailing/) from the race. Alex Thomson, on *Hugo Boss,* [suffered rudder damage from striking something floating](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/11/alex-thomson-on-hugo-boss-out-of-vendee-globe-race/), forcing him to retire as well.  Both boats had OSCAR systems installed aboard.

Before coming to any conclusion about the effectiveness of installing collision avoidance electronics, it may be worthwhile to consider what the UFOs are likely to be.  

Not all UFOs are really unidentified. Alex Thomson reported signs of fishing nets on his damaged rudder. In the last sailing of the race, Vincent Riou was forced to retire after [his boat struck a drifting steel buoy](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/11/danger-adrift-vincent-riou-retires-from-vendee-globe-after-collision-with-drifting-bouy/). Based on video footage taken after the collision in 2016, [Kito de Pavant’s boat was damaged after hitting a sperm whale](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/03/vendee-globe-racer-kito-de-pavants-boat-hit-sperm-whale/). 

There is no absolute determination of what [Thomas Ruyant struck that crippled and very nearly sank his boat](https://www.yachtingworld.com/news/solo-sailors-yacht-splitting-apart-like-egg-shell-exceptionally-violent-collision-southern-ocean-102323) in 2016, although based on the damage, a floating shipping container seems like a good bet.

For most of these collisions, whether the object is identified or not, it is not clear that systems like OSCAR featuring multiple cameras supported by artificial intelligence will be of any practical use. 

Abandoned fishing nets and tackle, often called “[ghost nets](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/thousands-miles-ghost-fishing-nets-ocean-threaten-marine-life-n402366)” float below the water’s surface and can easily damage the carbon fiber appendages or even the keel of a racing yacht.  

Shipping containers can float just inches above the surface of the ocean and can be almost impossible to spot either visually or electronically with any sort of sea running.

Marine mammals can be killed by being run down by a racing yacht traveling at 15-30 knots and are not likely to be picked up by collision avoidance systems.

So far at least, it appears that sophisticated electronics may not yet provide an effective answer as to how to avoid collisions at sea between UFOs and high-speed racing yachts.
