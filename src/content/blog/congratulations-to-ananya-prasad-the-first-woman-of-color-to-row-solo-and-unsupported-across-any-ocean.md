![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/02/atlanticodyssey.jpg)Congratulations to [Ananya Prasad](https://x.com/ao2024ananya?lang=en) for completing the 2024-2025 [World’s Toughest Row – Atlantic Challenge](https://www.worldstoughestrow.com/the-atlantic/), a 3,000 mile race across the Atlantic Ocean from San Sebastian in La Gomera, Canary Islands to Nelson’s Dockyard, Antigua after 52 days at sea. The 34-year-old from Sheffield came in second among the six solo rowers competing in the race.

Ms Prasad, born in India and raised in the UK, was the only solo female rower in the race. She is also the first woman of color to row solo and unsupported across any ocean. 

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd9g280gngo) reports that despite having no rowing experience, she decided to take part in the World’s Toughest Row event. She said she hopes her achievement will encourage others to “take on challenges they might not have considered possible”.  
   
Event organizers said Ms Prasad “has entered the record books as the first woman of color to row solo and unassisted across any ocean”.

Speaking before she set off, she said: “This isn’t just about me. It’s about encouraging women of color – and anyone from a different background – to take on challenges they might not have considered possible.

“It’s about breaking barriers, not just for women, but for anyone who feels like they don’t have the support or representation to pursue something like this.”

Ms Prasad added she took part in the challenge to help raise money for the Mental Health Foundation and the Deenabandhu Trust, which offers a home and education for children who have been orphaned and living in poverty in South India.

In the video below, Ms Prasad describes her reasons for competing in the race and the difference she hopes her example will set.
