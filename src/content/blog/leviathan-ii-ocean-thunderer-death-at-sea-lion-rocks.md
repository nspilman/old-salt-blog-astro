In 1998, the [whale-watching boat *Ocean Thunderer* was hit by a wave and swamped,](http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/marine/1998/m98w0045/m98w0045.asp#a22) throwing all on board — three passengers and one boat operator — into the waters near Sea Lion Rocks, also known as Plover Reefs, off the western shore of Vancouver Island, Canada, near Tofino. The boat operator and one passenger drowned. The two other passengers were rescued, suffering from hypothermia.

Last Sunday, the [whale-watching boat *Leviathan II* broached and capsized](http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/leviathan-iis-final-tragic-voyage-a-flare-shot-up-as-tour-boat-went-down), throwing most of its passengers overboard near Sea Lion Rocks, not far from where *Ocean* *Thunderer* swamped seventeen years before. Five of the *Leviathan II’s* passengers drowned and one is still missing and presumed dead.

The death toll would have likely been much larger were it not for the rapid rescue by boats from the Ahousaht First Nation, as well as by other local fishermen. The water temperature on Sunday was around 55 degrees F. The investigation into the cause of the accident has just begun. Both whale-watching boats, *Leviathan II* & *Ocean Thunderer,* were owned by the same owner, [Jamie’s Whaling Station & Adventure Centres](https://www.jamies.com/).

The two whale-watching boats were extremely different, one to the other. *[Ocean Thunderer](http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/marine/1998/m98w0045/m98w0045.asp#a22)* was an open 20′ long RIB, a Rigid Inflatable Boat. It had a twelve passenger capacity and was powered by two 135 horsepower outboard engines. The three passengers and one operator were all wearing full body “floater suits” which served as floatation and also provided some thermal protection in the cold waters off Vancouver Island, which were around 53 degrees when the accident took place in March of 1998. Despite the floater suits, two of the four drowned and the two survivors both suffered from hypothermia.

The *Leviathan II* was a 65′ long converted tug boat, built in 1981 and converted for whale watching in 1996. An upper deck was added during the conversion. [Under Canadian safety regulations, an inclining test was not required following the conversion](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/whale-watching-boat-accident-tofino-1.3293618). Instead, a simple roll test was used in which the stability of the converted vessel could be estimated.  When the *Leviathan II*  capsized, it was reported that most of the passengers were on the upper deck on the port side. A wave from the starboard side struck the vessel before she broached and capsized. The passengers were not wearing PFDs or other protective gear. The Canadian Coast Guard has towed the capsized *Leviathan II* into protected waters and should be able to determine whether the vessel had the required stability for the number of passengers and the conditions.

The reports of the conditions on the water when the *Leviathan II* have been varied from being glassy smooth to choppy. Initial media reports of a “rogue wave” do not seem to be supported by the accounts of boaters in the area.

Why was it that both whale-watching boats would swamp or capsize at almost the same location almost two decades apart?  It appears that after watching whales, the boats often go to Sea Lion Rocks, also known as Plover Reefs, to observe the seal rookeries. Tragically, the area around the rocks can be treacherous.

As reported by the [Globe and Mail](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/questions-raised-about-weather-conditions-on-day-leviathan-ii-sank/article27014063/):  *Fishermen and fishing guides who were on the water on Sunday did not report seeing any huge waves, but they say the area’s intricate pattern of tides and winds can produce dangerous conditions in localized spots.*

*Steve Lawson, who lives year-round on Wickaninnish Island and travels on the waters of Clayoquot Sound almost daily, said that Plover Reef, where the accident occurred, can be such a location. It lies on the outer coast and is exposed to the big, steady waves, known as rollers, that come in from the open Pacific.*

*“It’s a tricky spot,” he said.*
