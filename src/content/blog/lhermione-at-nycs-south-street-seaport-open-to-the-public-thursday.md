![hermionestatue](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/hermionestatue.jpg)This morning, the replica French frigate *l’Hermione* arrived in New York harbor and was welcomed  by American and French officials, led by French Minister Ségolène Royal and Mayor of Rochefort Hervé Blanché at Pier 15  at the South Street Seaport on the East River. The ship is a replica of the frigate that carried the Marquis de Lafayette to America in 1780 with the news that France was committing to support George Washington and his forces in the revolution against Great Britain. *l’Hermione* will be open for the public for ship tours tomorrow and Friday, July 2-3, 2015 from 9:00 am – 4:00 pm.

Onshore there will also be a photographic display of Lafayette’s role in the American Revolution and the Hermione’s reconstruction. Also, the Heritage Village will feature Revolutionary era re-enactors with historic shipbuilding crafts demonstrations, interactive conversations with the sailors, and a lineup of cultural activities including costumed performances by re-enactors, concerts of period and contemporary music and craft exhibitions.

On Saturday, *l’Hermione* will lead a parade of parade of nearly 100 ships and boats past the Statue of Liberty and up the Hudson River. The route begins south of the Verrazano Bridge, heads north Statue of Liberty, up to the Intrepid Museum and back down again. The parade is expected to run from 9 AM to 3PM.
