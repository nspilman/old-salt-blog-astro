*Monitor HMS M33 once shelled Turkish positions in the Dardanelles during the ill-fated campaign to advance up the peninsula, seize Constantinople and knock the Ottoman Empire out of World War 1.*

*For nearly 20 years, the gunship has been slowly undergoing restoration work in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard just a stone’s throw from Nelson’s Victory.*

*That work should now be completed – allowing the public to go aboard M33 for the first time – as the Heritage Lottery Fund has earmarked £1.79m for the restoration project.*
