CNN reported that the US Coast Guard had fired shots at a passenger vessel on the Potomac River a short distance from where 9/11 memorial events were taking place at the Pentagon.   Later reports say that the incident was in fact a training exercise and claims that no shots were fired.

We are awaiting confirmation that the exercise was scheduled by the Coast Guard’s Department of Really Lousy Timing and Stupid Stunts.
