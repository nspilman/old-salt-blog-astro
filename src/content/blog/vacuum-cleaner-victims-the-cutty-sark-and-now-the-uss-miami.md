Victims of Vacuum Cleaners?

There is a new threat to our nautical heritage and our nation’s defense!  In 2007, the composite tea clipper *[Cutty Sark,](http://www.cuttysark.com/)* built in 1869, was ravaged by fire.  An investigation revealed the culprit – an [industrial vacuum cleaner](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3108105/Cutty-Sark-fire-caused-by-fire-in-vacuum-cleaner-left-on-ship-by-workers.html).   Now, it appears that a vacuum cleaner has struck again!   Investigators say that a vacuum cleaner caused the [recent fire on the nuclear submarine USS *Miami*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/05/24/fire-on-nuclear-submarine-uss-miami-in-maine-shipyard/) in a shipyard in Maine, causing an estimated $400 million of damage.
