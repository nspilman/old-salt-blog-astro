Congratulations to [Australian Bill Hatfield,](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-22/bill-hatfield-oldest-person-to-sail-solo-around-the-world/11991436) who at 81, recently completed a solo, non-stop, unassisted circumnavigation of the globe. His almost nine-month voyage on his 38-foot yacht *L’Eau Commotion*, was all the more remarkable because he sailed westward against the prevailing winds and currents. He had previously made three unsuccessful attempts but was turned back each time by weather or damage to his boat. 

The previous holder of bragging rights to the title of oldest solo circumnavigate is [Jeanne Socrates, who at 77 completed a solo, unassisted circumnavigation.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/09/welcome-home-jeanne-socrates-record-setting-circumnavigator/)
