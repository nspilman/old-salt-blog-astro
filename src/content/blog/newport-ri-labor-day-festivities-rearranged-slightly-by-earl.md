[After Earl, some R.I. weekend events adjust schedules](http://www.projo.com/news/content/weekend_events_after_earl_09-04-10_QDJPLH2_v11.20eeef9.html)

*To give participants in the [Museum of Yachting’s 31st annual Classic Yacht Regatta](http://www.moy.org/NewsEvents/ClassicYachtRegatta/tabid/478/Default.aspx)* *in Newport time to get their boats back in the water in the wake of the storm, races scheduled for Saturday afternoon have been canceled. Event organizer Christina Marfuggi said everything else will go as planned, including a cocktail party from 6:30 to 8 p.m. Saturday at Fort Adams State Park and the Classic Yacht Parade, which assembles Sunday at 10:30 a.m. off Goat Island and cruises along Newport Harbor. More information can be found on the website, [moy.org](http://www.moy.org/NewsEvents/ClassicYachtRegatta/tabid/478/Default.aspx)*

*The [Newport Waterfront Irish Festival](http://www.newportwaterfrontevents.com/newport-waterfront-irish-festival/overview-newport-waterfront-irish-festival.htm)**, which was to begin Saturday morning, is pushing back its opening to 2 p.m.*

*Organizers of the Tastes of the Working Waterfront History Walking Tour, which begins at 11:30 a.m. Saturday at the Newport Restoration Foundation Museum Store at 415 Thames St., say they anticipate sunny weather and see no reason to cancel or postpone.*

Thanks to [Newport Betty](http://open.salon.com/blog/newport_betty) for reminding me that we ignored Newport.
