Outgoing New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a plan to shift traffic away from the city’s roads to its rails system and, particularly, to “blue highways,” the network of waterways that have for so long defined the city.

“For centuries, maritime freight was the core of New York City’s economy. Now, it’s time to re-engage the blue highway that can make deliveries safer, faster, and more sustainable,” he said.

“This report charts a real path forward for the future of a greener local economy — all while creating jobs and reducing traffic and pollution.”

As reported by [Paul Liotta, for the Staten Island Advance](https://www.silive.com/news/2021/12/nyc-launches-38-million-plan-to-build-sustainable-freight-network-using-waterways.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=statenislandadvance_sf&fbclid=IwAR0_0cnW89uKsSSmpHQ40jjlyqPnDMPNq1SsUbqbGKl7hn6Wvy6VIeXc-kY), the city’s plan proposes modernizing the bridge, as well as expanding its use of rail freight in other parts of the city.

Of the plan’s $38 million, $18 million is for the [“blue highways” program](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/ferrybus/bluehighways.shtml), a joint effort between the city Department of Transportation and NYCEDC to spur private investments in marine vessels to transport goods around the city.

Delivery companies like DHL and UPS utilize small vessels on waterways and electric ground vehicles in Europe to make some deliveries, particularly over their final miles.

The new system would utilize the city’s existing marine facilities, including docks used by New York Waterways.

DOT estimates that between January 2020 and September 2021 truck traffic over the city’s East River crossings, like the Manhattan Bridge, had increased 50 percent.
