![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ghostwife.jpg)Sadly, it apparently wasn’t a relationship meant to last. Earlier this year, Amanda Sparrow Large, 46, from Loth, Ireland was married to a Haitian pirate named Jack. Jack and Ms. Large were married by a shaman priest in a boat off the Irish coast in international waters. [Now they are apparently spitting up.](https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/louth-woman-married-ghost-pirate-13708090) While no specific reasons were given for the parting, irreconcilable differences may have played a role.  For one thing, while Amanda is by all appearances alive and well, Jack is said to be a ghost, having been executed for piracy in the 1700s. 

If anyone was suited to marry a 300-year-old dead pirate’s ghost, it would appear to be Amanda Sparrow Large, a Jack Sparrow impersonator, who gave up on living and breathing men and chose a spirit companion. But then the course of true love never did run smooth, especially when marrying the non-corporeal.
