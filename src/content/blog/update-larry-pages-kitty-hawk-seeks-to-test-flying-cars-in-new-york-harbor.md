![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/10/pageflyer.jpg)Two years ago, we [posted about an all-electric “flying car”](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/05/really-need-flying-jet-ski/) which was actually more of a single passenger seaplane, as it took off and landed on the water. The startup named [Kitty Hawk](https://kittyhawk.aero/) has major funding from [Larry Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page), the billionaire co-founder of Google. Now Kitty Hawk is seeking to test their updated version of the craft in New York Harbor. Whether or not this is a good idea remains to be seen.

[Jersey Digs](https://jerseydigs.com/exclusive-kitty-hawk-seeks-to-test-flying-cars-along-waterfront-jersey-city/) reports that the company filed plans with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) in connection with a proposal to bring its [Flyer](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/kitty-hawk-flyer-electric-ultralight/) [aircraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjqR4JAsL1A) to Jersey City’s Hudson River waterfront.

Kitty Hawk submitted “waterward” and “landward” waterfront individual permit applications in August as part of its vision to develop a “temporary hangar and one temporary floating dock for the \[Flyer\] test pilot program,” according to NJDEP filings. The facility in question would be situated along Hudson Street, but the specific location is not yet clear.

[Kitty Hawk](https://flyer.aero/) describes the Flyer as an all-electric VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) vehicle powered by 10 independent lift fans. The craft is a single-seater that operates between 3-10 feet off the water. Flyer has already successfully flown over 25,000 times.

The [Kitty Hawk Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_Hawk_Corporation) states that the production Flyer was revealed on June 6, 2018: it does not need a pilot license as it is built under US FAR Part 103 ultralight regulations. The Flyer has a published range of about 6 NM and an operating time of 20 minutes. It can typically fly at 20 mph, with a top speed of 30. It has a maximum service ceiling of 20 feet.
