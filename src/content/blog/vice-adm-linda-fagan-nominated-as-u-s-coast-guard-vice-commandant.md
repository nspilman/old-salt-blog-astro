Fagan](https://www.uscg.mil/Biographies/Display/Article/1391225/vice-admiral-linda-l-fagan/) was nominated as the next Vice Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security announced on Monday.

The nomination by President Biden, pending approval by the U.S. Senate, would make Fagan the Coast Guard’s first female four-star admiral, the branch [said in a press release](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCG/bulletins/2cd64a8).

Vice Adm. Fagan’s Coast Guard career has taken her to all seven continents. In 2010, she became the [first woman to command Sector New York](https://www.silive.com/news/2010/06/new_uscg_commander_first_woman.html).

Vice Adm. Fagan currently serves as the commander of the Coast Guard Pacific Area, overseeing all Coast Guard missions from the Rocky Mountains to the waters off the East Coast of Africa. Fagan concurrently serves as commander, Defense Force West, and provides Coast Guard mission support to the Department of Defense and Combatant Commanders. She is a 1985 graduate of the Coast Guard Academy and is the Coast Guard’s first-ever Gold Ancient Trident, the officer with the longest service record in the Marine Safety field.

Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas released the following [statement](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/04/19/statement-secretary-mayorkas-president-biden-s-nomination-vice-adm-fagan-uscg-vice):

“I am pleased that President Biden has nominated Vice Admiral Linda Fagan to be the Vice Commandant of the United States Coast Guard.  She is a superb leader who, as the 32nd Vice Commandant, will guide the Coast Guard at a time when its mission of securing our maritime borders, ports, and waterways has never been more important.  If confirmed, Vice Admiral Fagan would serve as the first woman to be promoted to a 4-star rank in the Coast Guard.  We are grateful to Vice Admiral Fagan for continuing her service to country, for the trail she has blazed, and for inspiring us all.”
