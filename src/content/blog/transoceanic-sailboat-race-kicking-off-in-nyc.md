*Six sailors are looking to make history.    Two sailboats, the W Hotels and Estrella Damm, docked in New York harbor will set off for Barcelona, Spain, early next month. They are racing against each, as well as history.*  
  
*The record the two motorless ships aim to break involves taking the least amount of time to make a transatlantic journey. The best time was never officially recorded. Back in 1880, a ship known as the Pablo Sensat, was said to have made the crossing in 28 days.*

*Numerous events will take place throughout the city before the race starts sometime between April 5 and April 12. The two vessels will arrive in Barcelona sometime between April 20 and April 30. Weather is the prime factor determining when the two boats depart.*

*On April 3, the two boats will have a short race to test their strength before taking on the Atlantic Ocean. The main race from shore to shore is 3,750 nautical miles and the winner gets the Prince of Asturias and Girona trophy, which was designed specifically for the occasion.*
