![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hmsqe2.jpg)The HMS *Queen Elizabeth* set sail yesterday from Portsmouth Naval Base bound for the United States. The 65,000-tonne carrier, the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy, will embark two US F-35B test aircraft to begin the first flight trials.

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-45226387) reports that they are expected to carry out 500 landings and take-offs during the carrier’s 11 weeks at sea.

Capt Jerry Kyd, the carrier’s commanding officer, added: “Crossing a major ocean with 1,500 sailors, aircrew and marines embarked and the specter of the first F-35B Lightning landing on the deck in September is very exciting for us all.

“It has been an incredible journey since we left Rosyth just over a year ago and we are all looking forward to this next seminal chapter in HMS *Queen Elizabeth*‘s life.”

On leaving Portsmouth, HMS *Queen Elizabeth* will carry out tests in UK waters before heading across the Atlantic to the US where it will also visit New York.

The carrier is expected to be ready for its first operational deployment in 2021.

The first of the UK’s joint [Royal Navy and RAF F-35B supersonic jets](https://www.forces.net/news/all-you-need-know-about-f-35b-lightning-ii) arrived from the US in June and are based at RAF Marham in Norfolk.  Testing onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth is scheduled for next year.
