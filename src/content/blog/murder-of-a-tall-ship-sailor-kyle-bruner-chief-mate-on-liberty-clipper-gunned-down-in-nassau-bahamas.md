Sadly, the world is a dangerous place, both at sea and ashore. Over the weekend, Kyle Bruner, chief mate on the schooner [*Liberty Clipper*](http://www.libertyfleet.com/tall-ship-cruise/our-fleet/liberty-clipper)  was murdered in Nassau, Bahamas while attempting to stop a mugging.  As reported by [NBC Chicago](http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Chicago-Sailor-Killed-During-Robbery-in-Bahamas-207185111.html):

*Kyle Bruner, 34, was working as first mate on the Liberty Clipper when he witnessed three men mugging two women on the streets of Nassau, Bruner’s father, Rick, confirmed with NBC Chicago.*

*“Kyle intervened and they grabbed the bags and ran off, and as they were running off, one turned and fired a shot at him and hit him in the neck,” Rick Bruner said*.
