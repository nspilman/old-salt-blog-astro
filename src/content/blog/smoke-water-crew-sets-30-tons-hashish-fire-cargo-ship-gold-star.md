As reported by [NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/09/09/220666201/found-at-sea-30-tons-of-hashish-on-fire): *A fire aboard a cargo ship in the Mediterranean Sea was set in order to get rid of 30 tons of hashish, according to officials in Italy and Malta. Authorities had approached the Gold Star, a Tanzania-registered ship, for an inspection Friday afternoon. But members of the crew reportedly set fire to their cargo, which Italian authorities identified as hashish resin. The incident began in waters about 30 nautical miles north of Malta, where police and firefighting ships converged on the Gold Star as it burned Friday night. They succeeded in quenching the flames around noon Saturday.*

Last night the [Daily Show](http://www.thedailyshow.com/) put its own spin on the story. Thanks to Phil Leon for contributing to this post.
