![EclipseHalo1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/03/EclipseHalo1.jpg)Happy first day of Spring! The arrival of the vernal [equinox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox) happens to coincide with a [solar eclipse](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/21/science/space/solar-eclipse-europe.html), as well as with a “[supermoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon),” and here on the west bank of the Hudson River, a snowstorm designated “[Winter Storm Ultima](http://www.weather.com/storms/winter/news/winter-storm-ultima-northeast-spring-snow-forecast).” (Let us hope the name “Ultima” is as in, “last or final.”)  A very busy day, indeed. I would have been happy just settling for warm winds and blue skies.

The [solar eclipse is expected to be visible in parts of Northern Europe](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/21/science/space/solar-eclipse-europe.html) today, although there have been reports of cloudy skies which may obscure some of the better vantage points. Clouds are not the only concern.  Yesterday, a [Czech tourist who was camping on the remote Arctic island of Svalbard](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/11483443/Tourist-in-Svalbard-during-solar-eclipse-mauled-by-polar-bear.html) in order to watch the solar eclipse, was dragged out of his tent by a polar bear. Fortunately, the bear was driven off and the Czech’s injuries were reported not to be life-threatening.

The “[supermoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon)” also known as a perigee moon, happens when the full or new moon is at its closest to the Earth, making the full moon look slightly larger than normal. As today’s is a new moon, we won’t see it at all unless you happen to be in the eclipse zone, where it will be blocking the sun. “Supermoons” are not all that unusual.  We have had two so far this year and expect a total of six in 2015. “Supermoons” that coincide with the equinox and a solar eclipse are, however, out of the ordinary.

What does any of this mean? Some astrologists think that it is a big deal, considering the near simultaneous equinox, eclipse and “super moon” to be a “[total system reboot.](http://www.elephantjournal.com/2015/03/march-solar-eclipse-total-system-reboot/)”

Astrologer [Crystal B](http://www.elephantjournal.com/2015/03/march-solar-eclipse-total-system-reboot/) writes: *“This Solar Eclipse in particular is even more impactful because it’s a supermoon and eclipse rolled into one. That means we can expect to feel even more ramped up and ready to go. On top of that, it’s occurring in the 29th degree of Pisces which is the last degree of the zodiacal wheel. That means we’re in the process of saying goodbye to something while embarking upon totally new territory. Something new is waiting and it’s up to us to seize the opportunity.  Something else to be aware of is this Solar Eclipse holds a ton of spiritual splash in the background.  The sun, moon, Mercury, Chiron and Neptune are all nestled in the sign of Pisces at the peak of it.”*

Astrologer [Meg Benedicte](https://newearthcentral.com/across-the-threshold/), adds: *“The cosmic reboot acts as a pressure valve release of toxic energy into the 4D astral plane. With conscious focus we need to release the old patterns, contain our sovereign energy field, detach from the collective toxic sludge, and ground to the center on our path of Light. 2015 is encoded for all awakened Starseeds/Light Bearers to ‘turn on’ their Soul Merkaba Light Body and quantum shift the planet into higher consciousness. The momentous events on Friday, March 20th will accelerate the Cosmic Ascension Plan into warp speed!”* 

Well, OK then.

For the more reality based among us, Phil Plait of the [Bad Astronomy blog](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/03/16/bad_astronomy_video_astrology.html), puts astrology in perspective in his post: [Does Astrology Work? I’m Gonna Go With “No.”](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/03/16/bad_astronomy_video_astrology.html)

On there other hand, there may be nothing wrong with taking the day as a good time for a “total system reboot,” in a metaphorical sense. In the mean time, I will hold out for a sunshine, flowers and a warm winds.
