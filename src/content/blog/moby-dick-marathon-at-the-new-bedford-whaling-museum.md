![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/logo2.png)There is no bad time to read Melville.  For the past 15 years in early January, the [New Bedford Whaling Museum](http://www.whalingmuseum.org/) has a held a [Moby Dick Marathon](http://www.whalingmuseum.org/prog/marathon.html), an event which includes a non-stop reading of the great American novel.  This year’s festivities will be spread over three days starting Friday night, January 7th, running through Sunday, January 9th.  From their [website,](http://www.whalingmuseum.org/prog/marathon.html) it appears that there will be a live feed for anyone wishing to watch remotely.  
  
But why have a Moby Dick Marathon this time of year?  Various locales including Mystic Seaport hold their Moby Dick Marathons around August 1st,  – Melville’s birthday.  The folks at New Bedford decided to celebrate the anniversary of Melville’s 1841 departure from the Port of New Bedford and Fairhaven aboard the whale ship *Acushnet.* Any why not? For years, there was a Moby Dick Marathon over Labor Day in Sag Harbor New York, and last year there was a Moby Dic Marathon in March in Falmouth, on Cape Cod.  The lesson here – there is no bad time to read Melville.
