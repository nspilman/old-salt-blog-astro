Intriguing, if it turns out to be true.

[Czar’s gold treasure found on Baikal Lake bed](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/Czars-gold-treasure-found-on-Baikal-Lake-bed/articleshow/6469500.cms)

*The legendary gold treasure of Russia’s last Czar could have been found by Mir-2 mini submarine on the bed of the world’s deepest fresh water lake Baikal in Siberia, according to reports.*  
  
*The legends say gold estimated at 1,600 tons and worth billions of dollars, was lost after the train of White Admiral Alexander Kolchak, who had declared himself ruler of Siberia during Civil War plunged into the lake from the Krugobaikalskaya line at Cape Polovinny.*

*“The Russian Mir-2 mini-sub has found a number of shiny metal objects on the bottom of Lake Baikal that could be the legendary Czar’s gold lost during the Russian civil war,” RIA Novosti reported quoting the Fund for the Protection of Lake Baikal.*

*Explorers have long been searching for the Czar’s gold that was allegedly carried by Admiral Alexander Kolchak as he fled the advancing Red Army during the Civil war after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.*

*Last year, when explorers found fragments of railway wagons and ammunition boxes dating from the civil war, there was, however, considerable scepticism that the gold was still in the lake.*

*However, yesterday the Mir-2 submersible found “shiny metal objects” resembling gold bullions some 400 metres below the surface near Cape Tolsty.*
