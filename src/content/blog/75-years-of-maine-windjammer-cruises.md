![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/t300-Bailey-bow.jpg)For hundreds of years, coastal schooners carried cargoes up and down the hundred harbored coast of Maine.  By the early part of the last century, the schooners were being replaced by trucks and trains.   In 1936 Captain Frank Swift started buying laid  up schooners to cruise in the Maine summers.  Schooners that had carried stone, lumber, hay and all manner of goods, began carrying vacationers.  Now 75 years later the Maine windjammer fleet is still going strong, preserving the schooners and their heritage while delighting tens of thousands who have sailed on them.

On Thursday, April 28 at 6:30 p.m,  Capt. Ray Williamson of Camden will be speak at the Camden Public Library on the history of [Maine Windjammer Cruises](http://www.mainewindjammercruises.com/), a company he and his wife Ann have owned for the past 25 years.
