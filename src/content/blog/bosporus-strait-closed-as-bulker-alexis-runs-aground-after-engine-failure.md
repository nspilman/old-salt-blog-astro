![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/alexis.jpg)**Update:** One of the world’s busiest shipping channels was closed to traffic in both directions after *[Alexis](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/9609158)*, an 81,623 dwt bulk carrier, ran aground on May 8, in the Bosporus Strait, connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.

Four tugs, a fast rescue boat and divers were sent to the incident, which a Lloyd’s List casualty report said occurred at 0430 hrs. The tugs and rescue vessels were able to refloat the grounded bulk carrier. Vessel traffic in the Bosphorus was restored in both directions, the Directorate-General of Coastal Safety reported.

The *Alexis* is carrying food products from Ukraine to Egypt. The bulker experienced machinery failure, resulting in grounding near the Haydarpasa breakwater shallow water area during its passage through the Bosporus Strait towards the Sea of Marmara. No pollution has been reported.

Nearly 40,000 ships passed through the Bosphorus in 2023, according to the Turkish Transport Ministry.

This is the second time the strait has been closed to traffic in two days. A rudder failure on the Cameroon-flagged general cargoship *Brabus* suspended traffic in the morning of May 6. It was reopened to vessels at 0800 hrs yesterday after *Brabu*s was towed by a tug to anchorage at Buyukdere, Istanbul, as reported by [Lloyd’s List](https://lloydslist.com/LL1149056/Bosporus-Strait-closed-as-bulk-carrier-runs-aground).
