![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/03/Carnival_Triumph_Half_Moon_.jpg)Winds gusting to near hurricane strength broke the moorings on the [already damaged cruise ship *Carnival Triumph*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/02/carnival-triumph-update-coast-guard-says-fuel-line-leak-started-disabling-fire/) at her berth at BAE Shipyard in the Port of Mobile, Alabama at 1:45 p.m. CT on Wednesday. The [cruise ship, which had recently been adrift in the Gulf of Mexic](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/02/engine-room-fire-strands-carnival-triumph-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-will-be-towed-to-mexico/)o for five days after a fire and an electrical failure, was adrift again, this time down the Mobile ship channel where it is reported to have collided with another ship. Two men were in a guard shack that was blown into the river. One man was recovered and the other is still missing.

The [AP reports](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/carnival-triumph-adrift_n_3008967.html) that new damage to the cruise ship included “*a 20-foot gash about 2 to 3 feet wide … visible about halfway up the hull from the water … wrapped partway around the stern. Underneath the gashed area, two levels of railing were dangling and broken*.”  The *Carnival Triumph* is reported to have drifted for several hours before tugs could secure the ship at the Mobile Cruise Terminal. Thanks to Brian Frissel for passing along the news.
