*Armed pirates have held Paul, 60, and Rachel, 57, for a year and three weeks, since they were seized in the dead of night as they slept aboard their yacht off the Seychelles, 800 miles east of the African coast.*  
  
*They have been moved around a series of makeshift camps across Somalia’s rugged hinterland, living in rag tents, eating tinned spaghetti and goat meat, and under the constant watch of armed men – many of them teenagers.*

*Both have had bouts of ill health, and images of Mrs Chandler, an economist, released earlier this year showed her looking thin and weak.*

*She lost a tooth when she was hit with a rifle butt, and both have earlier reported being “caged like animals” and fearing that they would be “killed and abandoned here in the desert”.*

*Mr Aden Tiiceey, Adado’s governor, said they were both “tired but well” on Sunday, and it is expected that they will undergo medical checks as soon as they arrive in Nairobi.*

*Negotiations to free the couple dragged on as Somali clans and pirate leaders argued over the expected ransom, and agreed deals were ripped up at the last minute.*

*It is unclear why discussions were successful at this point, although it is understood that a fresh ransom was offered early last week.*

*The British government has a strict policy of not paying kidnappers, and it is thought that the money was raised from family and friends.*

*Mr and Mrs Chandler both retired early and sold their home in Tunbridge Wells to buy their 38ft yacht, the Lynn Rival, and to sail the world.*

*They and their family repeatedly warned the pirates that they were not wealthy, and would not be able to raise the original £4 million ransom that was demanded. It is understood that the final amount paid was a fraction of that sum.*
