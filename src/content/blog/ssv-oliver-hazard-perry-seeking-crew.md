*After a successful first season underway, we are excited to continue our year round operations with a voyage south to Florida, Bahamas and Bermuda.

We have a great team of project managers, naval architects and contractors on the job and expect to splash back in at the end of November.  At this point we will prepare for our voyage south departing early January for warmer climates.*

*– Chief mate (500T USCG with aux sail)*  
*– Third Mate (500T USCG with aux sail)*
