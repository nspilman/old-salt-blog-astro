Tipped off by fisherman who caught amphorae in their nets, the wreck of a Roman merchant ship, believed to date from between the 1st century B.C. and the 2nd century, has been located in 230 feet of water near the Italian port city of Genoa.  The ship is believed to have been carrying around 200 jars, known as amphorae.  Tests on recovered amphorae suggest that they were carrying pickled fish, grain, wine and oil. Thanks to Phil Leon for passing along the news.
