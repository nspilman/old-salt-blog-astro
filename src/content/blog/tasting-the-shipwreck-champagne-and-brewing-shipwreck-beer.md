Last July, we posted about [Baltic Bubbly – ‘World’s oldest champagne’](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/18/worlds-oldest-champagne-found-on-baltic-seabed/), bottles of champagne thought to pre-date the French Revolution found in a shipwreck on the Baltic seabed.  Recently there was a tasting of one of the bottles of the historic champagne in Mariehamn.  The champagne was judged to be quite palatable and is expected to fetch up to £40,000 a bottle at an upcoming public auction.

[Bottles of beer](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/09/05/baltic-shipwreck-with-worlds-oldest-champagne-and-now-the-worlds-oldest-beer/) were also found at the same shipwreck.  Last week, Finnish authorities said that they would allow one or several [modern breweries to replicate the recipe of beer](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ikED9LELGOIJIThISF_LAYPgfSlA?docId=CNG.6c1ce80f495890dd965a5a712f87dfef.1f1).
