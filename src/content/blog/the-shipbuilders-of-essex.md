Here is a wonderful 20 minute film made in 1947 about, as the tile suggests, shipbuilding in Essex, Massachusetts.  It has the slightly corny Hollywood production values of its time but does a good job at showing the construction of a fishing boat from the laying of the keel to the launching.  Notice the characteristic [Essex side launch](http://schoonerardelle.com/the-launching-of-a-new-schooner), which hasn’t changed much since at least 1947.  See our [previous post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/07/29/launching-the-ardelle/) of the launch of the pinky  [schooner *Ardelle*](http://schoonerardelle.com/). Thanks to the [SAIL Ardelle Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/SAIL-Ardelle/218566014829844?sk=info) for pointing out the video.
