A bit over a year ago, [we posted about the construction](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/08/third-replica-maryland-dove-under-construction/) of a new [*Maryland Dove*](https://www.marylanddove.org/the-new-maryland-dove) by the [Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum](https://www.cbmmshipyard.com/maryland-dove) shipyard. The ship, a reproduction of the 17th-century trading ship that accompanied the first settlers to what is now Maryland in 1634, has been completed after three years of construction and is [on her way to her homeport](https://cbmm.org/news/maryland-dove-heads-home/) of [Historic St. Mary’s City](https://www.hsmcdigshistory.org/).

The new *Maryland Dove* is the third replica of the historic ship to be built. The first was built in 1934 to commemorate Maryland’s tercentenary. The second, in 1977, has served as a floating exhibit for Historic St. Mary’s City. 

“I could not be prouder of the work that CBMM has achieved on the project,” said Kristen Greenaway, President & CEO of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum. “We were absolutely honored to be awarded the build contract, and it has been an organization-wide effort, and an absolute delight, to fulfill it.”

Upon arriving at Historic St. Mary’s City, *Maryland Dove* will serve as the organization’s floating ambassador, flagship exhibition, and a key tool in its educational programming. And thanks to key design elements and a summer of testing and certification, the new ship is authorized to carry passengers by the U.S. Coast Guard, allowing HSMC to take passengers for an on-the-water experience.  

The [public is invited](https://www.hsmcdigshistory.org/events/maryland-dove-commissioning-day-ceremony/) to help honor the arrival of the new *Maryland Dove* to Historic St. Mary’s City on August 27, 2022.
