A near record drought has lowered the water levels on the Rhine River, Europe’s most important inland maritime waterway, by five feet below average, stopping many ships and barges from trading.  In several locations, river levels have fallen to one hundred year lows.  To add to the difficulties, unexploded munitions from World War II have been exposed by the falling waters.  Bomb disposal experts detonated an incendiary bomb found near Koln and are evaluating how to dispose of a larger bomb  found lying in 16 inches of water near Koblenz.  A hand grenade was also recently found on the river bank near Bonn.
