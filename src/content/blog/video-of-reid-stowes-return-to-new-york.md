It was a fun family event, in many respects. I showed up at the southwest corner of Manhattan,  where I thought [Reid Stowe](http://1000days.net/home/) on the schooner *Anne* would sail by and found a group of Stowe’s family and friends had gotten there already.   His father, brother and sister were there. Several had flown up from the Carolinas. No doubt other family members were there as well, as were quite a number of friends. There were banners and drums and a good feelings as the prodigal returned.   There was also a photographer from the New York Post, who was attempting without much success to photograph another even entirely, who was snapping photographs of the schooner and Reid’s family.

The wind was gusting out of the northwest, so Reid proceeded to tack his way up the harbor, sailing in company with the schooners *[Pioneer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_\(schooner\))* and *[Adirondack III](http://www.sail-nyc.com/html/schooners_adirondack_imagine.html)*, all led by the historic fireboat *[John J. Harvey](http://fireboat.org/)* blasting her water cannon in celebration.
