Tommorrow, the [Charente-Maritime/Bahia Transat 6.50](http://www.charentemaritime-bahia.transat650.net/en) sets off from La Rochelle, France bound for Salvador de Bahia, Brazil via Funchal, Madeira.  Roughly eighty sailors from sixteen countries will sail the [Open/Mini 6.5](http://www.classemini.com/?titre=&mode=actualites&fiche=3695), a 21 foot long ocean racer, across the Atlantic.

One experienced competitor, [Jean-Marc Allaire](http://www.charentemaritime-bahia.transat650.net/en/news/62/jean-marc-allaire-found-dead-after-sea-accident.html), will not be sailing. Last week, his boat, Karantez VI, was found under full sail off Cap Ferret with no one aboard.  A short time later a body was found on Lège-Cap-Ferret’s beach, which was identified as Allaire.  Allaire was on his way to the start of the race when he apparently fell overboard.  The  [Charente-Maritime race began 34 years ago](http://www.charentemaritime-bahia.transat650.net/en/race/the-race.html) in 1977, which was also the year of  Jean-Marc Allaire’s birth.  Our sincere condolences to his family and friends.

Thanks to Michael Kingdom-Hockings for pointing out the story.
