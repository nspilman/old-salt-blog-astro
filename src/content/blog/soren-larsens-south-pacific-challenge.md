The good folks on the brigantine *[Søren Larsen](http://southpacificchallenge.com.au/)* are offering a “[South Pacific Challenge](http://southpacificchallenge.com.au/the-challenge.html),” a Youtube video competition where you can explain in a short video why you need to change your life and what a South Pacific voyage on the *Søren Larsen* would mean to you.   Visitors to their web site will have the opportunity to vote on the uploaded videos. Two winners will be chosen to feature in a professionally filmed documentary about their life changing voyage from the Cook Islands to Samoa on the *Søren Larsen*.  Entries must be submitted by Friday, April 20th 2012, at 3pm EST.  [Click here to learn more](http://southpacificchallenge.com.au/the-challenge.html).

The *Søren Larsen* was built in 1948 in Denmark and between 1949 and 1972 carried general cargo, timber & grain in the Baltic and between European ports. She was refurbished in 1978 and went on to be featured in the British series The Onedin Line, as well as in the movies “The French Lieutenant’s Woman”, “Count of Monte Cristo” and “Shackleton.”

The *Søren Larsen* is now based in Sydney, Australia, doing charters and daysails on Sydney Harbour over the summer months and voyaging through the South Pacific from April to November.

The *Søren Larsen* is a remarkably beautiful ship and the voyaging sounds fantastic. The only question that comes to mind is why is the gentleman in the video wearing a dress ship, suit vest and a tie?  Definitely not the shipboard uniform.
