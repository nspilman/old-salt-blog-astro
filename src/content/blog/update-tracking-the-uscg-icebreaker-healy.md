![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/nomehealy.jpg)The internet  is a wonderful thing. I am sitting in my office, which is around 70 degrees F (21 degrees C), drinking a hot cup of coffee, while tracking the painfully slow progress of the [USCG Icebreaker *Healy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Healy_\(WAGB-20\)) as it escorts the Russian tanker *[Renda](http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Renda-8129618.html)* through sea ice in the Bering Sea in an attempt [to deliver emergency fuel supplies to the Alaskan town of Nome](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/08/rescue-mission-to-nome-russian-tanker-renda-uscg-icebreaker-healy-battle-ice-to-deliver-fuel/). On the decks of the *Healy*, the temperature is -11 degrees F (-24 degress C.) In the last 12 hours, the ships have averaged less than 3 knots.  They are currently about 70 NM from Nome.
