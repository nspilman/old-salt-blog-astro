![Tberg](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Tberg.jpg)The headlines are great. “[Iceberg that Sank the Titanic 100,000 years old](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/139051/20160307/iceberg-that-sank-titanic-was-100-000-year-old.htm)” and “[Titanic iceberg was a 100,000-year-old giant](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Science/article1675467.ece)” and “[Iceberg that sank the Titanic was 100,000-years-old and of monstrous size”](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/iceberg-that-sank-titanic-was-100000-years-old-monstrous-size-1547844) and so and so on. Dozens of headlines and all are variations on the same theme. It must be true because so many news outlets are repeating it!  Or maybe not.

This ancient berg frenzy was apparently set off by a recent study by Grant Bigg, professor of earth system science at Sheffield University, whose team has been tracking the paths of icebergs. They chose to model the path of the iceberg with which the Titanic had its unfortunate meeting in 1912. Apparently the scientists said that the iceberg came from a glacier formed by snow which fell “over 100,000 years ago.” Viola, a hundred-year-old iceberg is born.

The problem is that snowfall does not an iceberg make. Snow does, over time, create a glacier and glaciers eventually calve to cause icebergs, but claiming that very old snow establishes the age of an iceberg is a rather heroic reach. The scientists estimate that the [berg calved from the glacier around 1908.](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/139051/20160307/iceberg-that-sank-titanic-was-100-000-year-old.htm) So this particular block of large and dangerous ice began drifting toward its rendezvous with the Titanic only four years before the collision.

When does an iceberg become an iceberg? It seems reasonable to me that until it calves from the glacier, it is, well, just part of the glacier. By this standard, rather than 100,000 years old, four years old seems like a better estimate of the age of the *Titanic’s* nemesis.

The iceberg was also apparently considerably larger when it calved from the Greenland glacier, but melted considerably before it met the Titanic. It was, nevertheless, still large enough to sink the ship.
