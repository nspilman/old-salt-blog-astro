Raw Faith

**Update**: The three masted schooner [Raw Faith is reported to now have sunk after the crew of two was rescued by the Coast Guard.](http://www.wlbz2.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=139863&catid=3)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Two men were rescued by the Coast Guard from *Raw Faith*, a home-built 118′ three masted schooner, one hundred miles south-east of  Nantucket today.    Reportedly the two had set sail from Salem, Massachusetts on December 4th bound for Bermuda.

Why anyone would set attempt to sail in December to Bermuda on a 118′ foot schooner with a crew of only two is unclear.  The rescue involved multiple aircraft and two Coast Guard cutters.  
  
The Coast Guard responded  to an EPIRB distress signal and launched multiple aircraft from Cape Cod and Elizabeth City, NC, as well as dispatching two cutters the *Tybee* and *Reliance.* The *Raw Faith* was found to have limited safety gear aboard, reportedly consisting of two life rafts, one survival suit and a hand-held radio.   The Coast Guard provided the two men with additional immersion suits and evacuated them by helicopter.  According to the [vessel’s web site](http://www.rawfaithadventures.com/content/coast-guard-boards-rawfaith): “*The Coast Guard has boarded RawFaith and have reported structural damage. The CG crew who have returned to the cutter have recommended not taking her under tow and only removing the captain and crew.*”

This was not the first time *Raw Faith* needed rescue. On [Thanksgiving Day in 2004, the Coast Guard towed the sailing vessel to Rockland](http://www.sail-world.com/cruising/index.cfm?nid=23890&rid=11) after it lost all three masts about 80 miles northeast of Portland.  One crew member was injured by falling rigging.
