Until fairly recently, every springtime, [American shad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_shad) made their annual runs up the Delaware, Hudson, Connecticut and other rivers of the East and Northeast to spawn.   The shad fishery in the Hudson lasted until the 1970s when their numbers dropped precipitously.  After dropping off in early 1900s, the shad have returned to the Delaware River.  This Saturday, April 23rd,  in the [Fishtown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishtown) neighborhood of Philadelphia, they are holding  the [3rd Annual Fishtown Shad Fest](http://www.fishtownshadfest.org/) at the beautiful Penn Treaty Park along the Delaware River.    Sounds like a great time.
