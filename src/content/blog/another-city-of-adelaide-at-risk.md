![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cityofa.jpg)We have posted extensively about the oldest just barely surviving composite clipper ship, the *[City of Adelaide](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/index.php?s=city+of+adelaide+clipper)*, which is in danger of being broken up in May. We have also noted the arguments over the *[HMAS Adelaide](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/03/28/hmas-adelaide-a-hard-ship-to-sink/)*, which may or may not be sunk as an artificial reef.  Now, with thanks to Dick Kooyman, we have learned of another *City of Adelaide* at risk of being moved to a local dump.

[Historic lifeboat bound for local dump](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/03/2834873.htm)  
  
*An historic lifeboat in a maritime museum at Port Lincoln could end up in a dump because funds cannot be found to restore it.   The City of Adelaide is steam-powered and jet-propelled and was SA’s first lifeboat.*

*It is displayed at Port Lincoln’s Axel Stenross Maritime Museum and has been declared an historic shipwreck, which requires that it be preserved.   But the council is investigating a proposal by Councillor Michael Bascombe that the wreck be “preserved” at Port Lincoln’s rubbish dump.*
