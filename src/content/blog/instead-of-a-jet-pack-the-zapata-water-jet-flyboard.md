I suppose for those who never got over not getting a jet pack for Christmas as a kid, the [Zapata Racing](http://www.zapata-racing.com/uk/flyboard_uk.php) water-jet Flyboard just might be perfect. It appears that if you connect one of these contraptions to a powerful jet ski and strap on the harnesses and hoses, that you can leap from the water like a porpoise and fly through the air, towing the jet ski behind you. As one who is always amazed that jet skiers do not kill themselves and others at an even higher rate than they already do, this rig just might increase the body count.  Safety concerns aside, it is fun to watch.
