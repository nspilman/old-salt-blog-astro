![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/clotilda.jpg)In January 2018, the news broke that a [journalist believed that he had found the burned wreckage](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/01/clotilda-cudjo-lewis-last-slave-ship-last-survivor/) of the schooner *Clotilda*, the last vessel to carry Africans into bondage in the United States. By March, however, further research and excavation determined that the [wreck was, in fact, not that of the infamous slave ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/03/update-alabama-shipwreck-not-schooner-clotilda-the-last-slave-ship/). Nevertheless, the near-discovery triggered renewed interest in finding the wreck.

Last week, the [National Geographic Society reported](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48377930) that the *Clotilda* has been found, discovered by archaeology firm company Search Inc, which was called in to help by the Alabama Historical Commission to investigate a likely wreck off Twelve Mile Island in the Mobile River delta. The dimensions and construction of the wreck matched those of the *Clotilda*, as did building materials, the commission said.

“We are cautious about placing names on shipwrecks that no longer bear a name or something like a bell with the ship’s name on it,” maritime archaeologist James Delgado said in a statement. “But the physical and forensic evidence powerfully suggests that this is *Clotilda*.”

[As we wrote previously](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/01/clotilda-cudjo-lewis-last-slave-ship-last-survivor/), the international slave trade had been illegal in the United States since 1807, but that didn’t entirely stop the evil business.  Local lore suggests that the voyage of the *Clotilda* began as a wager between Timothy Meaher, a wealthy Alabama ship and shipyard owner, and friends from New England. Meaher wagered that he could smuggle slaves from Africa into the United States without being caught.

In the autumn of 1859, or the summer of 1860, depending on the source, Captain William Foster brought the schooner *Clotilda* into Mobile Bay with a cargo of 110-160 captives from West Africa. Federal authorities had been tipped off to the arrival of the schooner. Fearful of criminal charges, Captain Foster arrived in the port at night and transferred his cargo to a riverboat, then burned and scuttled the *Clotilda*. 

“The discovery of the *Clotilda* is an extraordinary archaeological find,” said Lisa Demetropoulos Jones, the executive director of the Alabama Historical Commission. “The voyage represented one of the darkest eras of modern history and is a profound discovery of the tangible evidence of slavery.”

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/23/clotilda-last-known-us-slave-ship-found-near-mobile-alabama/1203399001/) notes that the enslaved people on board remained captive until the end of the Civil War. A small group of survivors and descendants then reunited in hopes of returning to Africa but instead created a new community – known today as Africatown – in the Plateau area of Mobile.

“This new discovery brings the tragedy of slavery into focus while witnessing the triumph and resilience of the human spirit in overcoming the horrific crime that led to the establishment of Africatown,” Jones said.
