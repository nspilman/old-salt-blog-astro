Lady Anastasia

Spain has recently seized three Russian superyachts believed to be subject to EU sanctions, including the [48-meter-long $7 million *Lady Anastasia*,](https://inews.co.uk/news/spain-seizes-three-superyachts-oligarch-sanctions-crackdown-crew-ukraine-sabotage-boat-1520817) which was partially sunk when sabotaged by its Ukrainian chief engineer. [Taras Ostapchuk, 55, the engineer](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/02/ukrainian-engineer-attempts-to-sink-oligarchs-yacht-my-boss-is-a-criminal/) was said to have been furious that arms shipped by the yacht’s owner, the oligarch Alexander Mikheyev, were allegedly used to attack his country. Ostapchuk was arrested but later left Spain to fight for Ukraine.

Spanish authorities also seized the 135-meter [*Crescent*](https://www.superyachtfan.com/yacht/crescent/), which is valued at $600 million, at the port in Tarragona, Catalonia, the transport ministry said on Wednesday. Spanish media speculated that the yacht could be owned by Russian President Vladimir Putin but police are still investigating who it belongs to.

On Monday, authorities seized the 85-meter (279-foot) $140 million [superyacht *Valerie*](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spain-seizes-russian-oligarchs-yacht-barcelona-2022-03-14/) in Barcelona. The yacht is believed to belong to Sergei Chemezov, a former KGB officer who heads state conglomerate Rostec.
