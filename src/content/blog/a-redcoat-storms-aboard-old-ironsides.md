The [Boston Globe has documented](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/gallery/Old_Ironsides?pg=2) the boarding of the [USS *Constitution*](http://www.history.navy.mil/ussconstitution/) by a Redcoat!  During her long years of active duty, the USS *Constitution*, known as Old Ironsides, was never successfully boarded by enemy marines.  Yet, here we see the distinctive uniform of a Royal Navy Marine – a red coat with white trim and a black belt.  Immediately behind the Redcoat was a gentlemen in green. Could that be a British rifleman?  The hat definably looks wrong however.  (Looks more like an elf than a rifleman. )  And I didn’t think the Royal Navy allowed their marines to have such long white beards. Very confusing.
