![mystictimber](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mystictimber.png)In 2009, we [posted about how thousands of trees downed by Hurricane Ike in Galveston](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/08/hurricane-ike-and-the-windfall-for-the-charles-w-morgan/), TX proved to be a literal and figurative windfall for [Mystic Seaport](http://www.mysticseaport.org/) in rebuilding the historic whaling ship, [*Charles W. Morgan*](http://www.mysticseaport.org/visit/explore/morgan/).  Of the 40,000 trees killed by the storm, there were a large numbers of live oaks, a tree widely used in early American shipbuilding. Mystic was able to source 176 tons of the live oak timber.  Since then Mystic has continued to work with municipalities and private land owners to source scare shipbuilding timber downed by hurricanes and severe weather. Here is a video of Mystic’s search for timber.
