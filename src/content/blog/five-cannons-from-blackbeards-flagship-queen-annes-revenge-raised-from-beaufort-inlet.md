This morning we posted about [a new video game, Assassins Creed IV : Blag Flag,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/11/assassins-creed-iv-blag-flag-slaughter-mayhem-shanty-singing-pirates/) which takes notable liberties with history.  One of the characters in the game, Edward Thatch, is based on the historical pirate, Edward Teach, better known as [Blackbeard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard). This week five cannon were raised from the ocean floor in Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina from the wreck of Blackbeard’s flagship, [*Queen Anne’s Revenge*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Anne%27s_Revenge), which the pirate ran aground in 1718.  Blackbeard escaped the grounding but was killed later that year by forces led by Lieutenant Robert Maynard.  The shipwreck was discovered in 1996.  Four of the iron guns recovered this week weighed in at 2,000 pounds each, while the fifth was over 3,000 pounds.  So far, 20 cannon have been recovered from the shipwreck.
