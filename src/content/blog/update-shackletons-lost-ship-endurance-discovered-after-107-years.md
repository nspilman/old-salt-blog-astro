![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/endurancestern.jpg)The [Endurance22 Expedition](https://endurance22.org/) announced today that they have discovered the remarkably intact remains of [Sir Ernest Shackleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton)‘s ship [*Endurance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_\(1912_ship\)), which was crushed by pack ice off Antarctica in 1915. 

A team of marine archeologists, adventurers, and technicians on the icebreaking research vessel [SA *Agulhas II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._A._Agulhas_II), battled shifting sea ice, blizzards, and temperatures that dropped to -18 degrees C, for over two weeks, before finding the sunken ship. Using undersea drones, the shipwreck of the *Endurance* was located 10,000 feet below the ice-covered surface of the Weddell Sea. 

“Without any exaggeration, this is the finest wooden shipwreck I have ever seen – by far,” said marine archaeologist Mensun Bound, who is on the discovery expedition and has now fulfilled a dream ambition in his nearly 50-year career.

Its timbers, although damaged by the sinking, are still very much together, and the name – *Endurance* – is clearly visible on the stern.  
   
“It is upright, well proud of the seabed, intact, and in a brilliant state of preservation,” he told [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-60662541).

*Endurance* was the three-masted barquentine in which Sir Ernest Shackleton and a crew of 27 men and one cat sailed for the Antarctic on the 1914–1917 [Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition). She was launched in 1912 from Sandefjord in Norway. Three years later, she was crushed by pack ice and sank in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica. All of her crew survived. Shackleton may be best remembered for leading an epic 720-nautical-mile open-boat journey to a South Georgia whaling station to arrange for the rescue of his crew.
