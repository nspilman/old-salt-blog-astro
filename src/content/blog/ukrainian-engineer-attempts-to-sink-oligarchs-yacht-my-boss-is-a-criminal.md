A [Ukrainian marine engineer was detained](https://www-ultimahora-es.translate.goog/sucesos/ultimas/2022/02/27/1704825/ucrania-rusia-detenido-marinero-ucraniano-por-hundir-yate-jefe-ruso-mallorca.html?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp) after attempting to sink the [*Lady Anastasia*](https://yachtharbour.com/yacht/lady-anastasia-716), a 48-meter-long $7 million superyacht owned by Russian oligarch and arms tycoon, Alexander Mijeev. The attempt took place on Saturday at Port Adriano in Mallorca.

The 55-year-old engineer, Taras Ostapchuk, had worked on the yacht for close to a decade and felt compelled to act after seeing a video of a Russian cruise missile partially destroying an apartment block resembling his own in Kyiv. His employer and the yacht’s owner, Mijeev, 61, is the CEO of Rosoboronexport, the weapons export arm of Russia’s state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec. Ostapchuk believes that the missile was manufactured by Rostec.

The engineer opened a sea valve in the engine room and one in the crew quarters, which began to flood the yacht. He warned the all Ukrainian crew aboard of his actions. He also closed the fuel valves to avoid pollution and shut off the ship’s electricity. 

A fight broke out between Ostapchuk and other members of the crew, who contacted the marina’s management, who contacted the police. The sea valves were closed before the ship sank. It is unclear how much damage was done by the flooding.

When the Civil Guard arrived, Ostapchuk turned himself in and said, “I don’t regret anything I’ve done and I would do it again.” He went on to say, “My boss is a criminal who sells weapons that kill the Ukrainian people.”

When Ostapchuk appeared before the court, explained why he did it, and showed photos of Kyiv, the judge acquitted him.

As of this morning, Ostapchuk was reported to be on his way back to Ukraine to join the fight against the Russian invaders.

“All Ukrainian citizens must be defenders of our fatherland because it is being subject to Russian aggression,” he told the Associated Press from Barcelona hours after being released from detention in Mallorca and just before boarding a flight to the Polish capital, Warsaw.
