![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/elfaro2.jpg)We know that the ro/ro *[El Faro](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/10/ntsb-report-el-faro-captain-reported-hull-breach/)* sank with all hands after it lost power in the path of Hurricane Joaquin in early October. The captain reported a hull breach. All 33 crew were lost.  We may never know too much more. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has announced that it has completed its search and video documentation of the sunken *El Faro*, which was located at a depth of 15,000 feet underwater.  The Voyage Data Recorder (VDR), the so-called “black box,” which might have provided answers to additional questions about the sinking, was not found,  however. From the [NTSB press release](http://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/PR_20151116.aspx):

*On Nov. 11, the navigation bridge was found but neither the mast nor the VDR was found in the vicinity of the navigation bridge structure.*

*After five more days of searching with CURV-21, it was determined that the VDR could not be located. The search and video documentation efforts of El Faro were completed on Nov. 15. No further search missions are planned.*
