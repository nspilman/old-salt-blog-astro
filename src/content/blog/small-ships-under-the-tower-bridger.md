*With the traditional rigging of a tall ship but only a fraction of the size, these two vessels are dwarfed by Tower Bridge.*

*The world’s smallest tall ships, [TS Caroline Allen and TS Bob Allen](http://littlebrigblog.blogspot.com/)* *– measuring just 30-feet in length, took to the River Thames today to train the next generation of seafarers.*

*They are usually housed at Cowes on the Isle of Wight and do most of their sailing on The Solent. Today they sailed under Tower Bridge without the roadway opening – something no other tall ship could boast.*
