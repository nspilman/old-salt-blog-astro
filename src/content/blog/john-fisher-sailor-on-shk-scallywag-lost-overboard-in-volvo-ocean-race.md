John Fisher

British sailor, [John Fisher](https://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/crew/648_John-Fisher.html), crew on the Volvo Ocean 65 *[Team Sun Hung Kai / Scallywag](https://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/teams/Team-Sun-Hung-Kai-Scallywag.html),* [went overboard on Monday and is presumed lost.](http://www.yachtingworld.com/news/british-volvo-ocean-race-sailor-lost-overboard-south-pacific-114110) Fisher went missing while on watch approximately 1,400 miles west of Cape Horn, in high seas, with winds at 35 knots. The water temperature was 9-degrees Celsius (48.2 degrees Fahrenheit.) After searching for Fisher for roughly ten hours, the team reluctantly called off their search and headed for South America.

[Richard Brisius, the President of the Volvo Ocean Race](https://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/news/11356_An-update-on-John-Fisher.html), issued the following statement:

*‘I am extremely sad to inform you that one of our sailors, John Fisher, from Team Sun Hung Kai / Scallywag, is now presumed to have been lost at sea.*

*‘This is heart-breaking for all of us. As sailors and race organisers losing a crew member at sea is a tragedy we don’t ever want to contemplate. We are devastated and our thoughts are with John’s family, friends and teammates.*

*‘Yesterday, just after 1300 UTC, Race Control for the Volvo Ocean Race were informed of a man overboard situation by Team Sun Hung Kai / Scallywag.*

*‘We immediately coordinated with the team as well as the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, who have located a ship and diverted it towards the scene. But at current speeds it remains over a day away.*

*‘With the rest of the Volvo Ocean Race fleet approximately 200 miles downwind, sending them back upwind to assist, against gale to storm force winds, was not a viable option.*

*‘The Sun Hung Kai / Scallywag team conducted an exhaustive search for several hours in extremely challenging weather conditions, but they were unable to recover their teammate.*

‘*Given the cold water temperature and the extreme sea state, along with the time that has now passed since he went overboard, we must now presume that John has been lost at sea.*

*‘All of us here at the Volvo Ocean Race organisation send our heartfelt condolences out to John’s family, his friends and his teammates and we will do everything in our power to support them in this very difficult time.*’

The Volvo Ocean site describes Fisher as a “*long-term member of the Ragamuffin and Scallywag super maxi crews, Fisher has plenty of big boat experience and has sailed with skipper David Witt for many years. A Sydney-Hobart veteran, he makes the step into the Volvo Ocean Race world for the first time in 2017-18.”*

This is the second tragedy to occur on the 2017-2018 Volvo Ocean Race. In late January, the [Volvo *Team Vestas 11th Hour* collided with a fishing boat](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/01/collision-volvo-ocean-race-kills-chinese-fisherman-nine-others-rescued/) near Hong Kong. One fisherman was killed.
