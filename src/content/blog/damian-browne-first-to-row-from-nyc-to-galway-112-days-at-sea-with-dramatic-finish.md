![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dbrowne.jpg)Former-professional rugby player Damian Browne became the first person ever to row from New York to Galway.  Browne began the 112-day voyage, titled Project Empower, from Chelsea Piers in Manhattan on Tuesday, June 14 at 3.10am.

After spending 2,686 hours at sea and rowing over 3,450 nautical miles, Browne’s arrival in Ireland was particularly dramatic. When only seven miles from Galway harbor, Browne and his boat *Cushlamachree* were caught in a storm. [He said the boat flipped over in 30-to-35-knot winds](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/06/nyregion/damian-browne-atlantic-row-nyc-ireland.html) and slammed against rocks at Na Forbacha at Furbo Beach, Galway. An emergency services crew was dispatched and took him to safety. Browne received a hero’s welcome from friends, family, and well-wishers.

The [Independent](https://www.independent.ie/news/damian-browne-irish-man-completes-historic-row-from-new-york-to-galway-after-112-days-at-sea-42038173.html) notes that  Browne began the journey with his friend Fergus Farrell, as they aimed to break a world record while also raising money for charity.

The duo hoped to break the world record by rowing the North Atlantic in just 55 days, but unfortunately, Farrell had to call it quits after two weeks at sea.

Farrell became ill on board and had to be taken off the boat to receive medical attention due to severe exhaustion, which was made worse by a recent spinal injury and collapsed lung. Browne completed the row alone.
