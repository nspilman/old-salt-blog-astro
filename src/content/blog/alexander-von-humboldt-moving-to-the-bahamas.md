In November we posted about the first shakedown day cruise of the *[Alexander von Humboldt II](http://www.afloat.ie/sail/tall-ships/item/16972-alexander-von-humboldt-ii-christened-in-bremerhaven-first-voyage-in-october),* Germany’s newest tall ship.  The new ship, operated by [Deutsche Stiftung Sail Training (DSST)](http://www.gruene-segel.de/experia-cgi/v2.2/viewhtml.pl?DescriptionFile=gruenesegel-menu.def&calling=home3_de&menudepth=1&language=de&User=&navigate_path=@1;homeen&menu=top_en&opened_navigate=0&OsCsid=&), is replacing the 1906 built *Alexander von Humboldt* which has been sailing as a sail training ship since 1988.

But what will become of the *[Alexander von Humboldt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt_\(ship\)),* known by her nickname*, Alex,* now that she has been retired by DSST?  She will be sailing out of Freeport in the Bahamas under the Bahamian flag.  The ship will host cruise ship passengers, island visitors and residents on coastal sailing excursions, as well serving as a venue for corporate gatherings, receptions and theme parties. She will also serve as a training vessels to train new Bahamian crews.  Thanks to Wojtek ‘Voytec’ Wacowski on Facebook for passing along the news.
