![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/06/00000049381.jpg)A 66 feet long, 165 tonne, starfish and barnacle encrusted, steel and concrete floating dock has washed up on  Agate  beach, south-west of Portland, Oregon.  A plaque on the dock identifies it as coming from the port of Misawa in northern Japan, washed free during the tsunami of 2011.  The dock has tested negative for radiation.  The dock drifted 5,000 miles over 15 months. Debris from the tsunami continues to be a hazard to navigation. Fortunately, no vessel collided with the floating dock at sea. Unfortunately, two other docks from the same port are still missing.
