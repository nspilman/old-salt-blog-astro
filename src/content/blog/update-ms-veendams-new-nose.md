In early January [we posted about Holland America Lines’ MS](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/09/ms-veendam-off-cape-horn/) *[Veendam](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/09/ms-veendam-off-cape-horn/)* hitting a Southern Ocean storm, encountering waves of over 30 meters and winds of 70 knots. At the time there was no reported to the ship or injuries to passengers or crew.   That report, as least as far as the ship is concerned, was premature.  [Maasmond Maritime](www.maasmondmaritime.com) recently posted photos of  the MS *Veendam* receiving a new “nose” in Bahamas Shipyard after been damaged during heavy seas near the Falklands.
