Eduardo Sareno, a survivor of capsized Gulf Livestock 1. A second survivor has now been rescued.

Two days after the [capsize and sinking of the livestock carrier, *Gulf Livestock 1*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/09/livestock-carrier-capsizes-in-typhoon-msysak-off-japan-one-survivor-rescued/), in Typhoon Maysak, the Japanese coast guard has rescued a second survivor. Jay-nel Rosales, 30, of the Philippines, was found floating alone in a life raft off the island of Kodakarajima in the East China Sea. Rosales was conscious and able to walk unaided. 

The only other survivor located thus far is Eduardo Sareno, the vessel’s 45-year-old chief officer, who found wearing a lifejacket after spending 24 hours in the water. The body of a deceased crew member has also been recovered. The remaining crew of 40 are missing and feared dead.  The ship’s cargo of over 5,800 cattle also perished.

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/japan-cargo-ship-sinking-cows-typhoon/2020/09/04/d07a0286-ee56-11ea-bd08-1b10132b458f_story.html) reports that rescuers have spotted the dead bodies of dozens of cattle floating in the ocean near the areas where the men were found, along with a bundle of orange rope and part of another lifejacket bearing the ship’s name. Aircraft, boats and divers continue to scour the ocean.

The rescue effort was initially hampered by rough seas, strong winds, and torrential rain. By the time the dead man was spotted Friday, the weather was cloudy, with winds around 20 mph, the coast guard said.
