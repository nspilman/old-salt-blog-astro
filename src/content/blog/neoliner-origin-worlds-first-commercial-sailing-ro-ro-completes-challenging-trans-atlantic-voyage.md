![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/neolinemaidenv.jpg)The world’s first commercial sailing ro/ro, the 136-meter [*Neoliner Origin*](https://www.neoline.eu/en/our-services/#navire), arrived in the Port of Baltimore on October 30, 2025, completing a challenging trans-Atlantic maiden voyage from Saint-Nazaire, France.  

According to [Neoline](https://www.neoline.eu/en/), two days into the voyage, the top panel on the aft main sail, one of the ship’s four sails, was damaged during a severe Atlantic storm. The *Neoliner Origin* continued its journey in hybrid mode, sailing on the undamaged forward mast sails along with its diesel-electric engine power. 

Technicians were flown to Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a French archipelago south of the Canadian island of Newfoundland, to assist with the sail repairs before it proceeded to Baltimore.

Built by RMK Marine Shipyard of Turkey, the *Neoliner Origin* is 446 feet long and can carry more than 5,300 tons of cars and farm and construction machinery or 265 twenty-foot containers on three decks.  It also accommodates 12 paying passengers, as well as 13 crew members. The ship will operate a monthly service between Saint-Nazaire, France, and Baltimore, with stops along the way to Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon and Halifax.

The ship is powered by two 295-foot masts and 32,000 square feet of sails on Solidsail rigs designed by Chantiers de l’Atlantique. Neoline estimates that wind will provide 60% to 70% of the vessel’s propulsion, backed by hybrid diesel-electric engines when needed. It typically sails at a reduced speed of 11 knots in order to conserve fuel and reduce emissions.
