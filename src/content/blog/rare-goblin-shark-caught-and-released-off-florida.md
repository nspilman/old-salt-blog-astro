A rare goblin shark was caught and subsequently released by shrimp fishermen off Key West last week was only the second ever found in the region.  The [goblin shark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_shark) is described as ‘*a rare, poorly understood species of deep-sea shark. Sometimes called a “living fossil”, it is the only extant representative of the family Mitsukurinidae, a lineage some 125 million years old.*‘
