USS Ponce

As Iranian saber-rattling raises tensions around the Straits of Hormuz, the US Navy has cancelled plans to decommission the 40 year old [USS *Ponce* (LPD-15)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Ponce_\(LPD-15\)), an Austin-class amphibious transport dock ship.  Instead the ship is reported to be being refitted to operate as a “mothership” from which commando teams can operate.

Or maybe not.  Some have suggested that It would not make sense to concentrate a number of the nation’s most elite warriors on a ship in the Persian Gulf where they would be vulnerable to a variety of Iranian attacks and would require other vessels to protect the “mothership.”   After the “commando mothership” story was widely reported, Fleet Forces Command commander [Admiral John Harvey](http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=138) said that the *Ponce* is “not going over there as an alternate command ship; it’s not going over there as a special operating force ‘Death-star Galactica’ coming through the Gulf…”  Instead, the revamped *Ponce* will serve as a “lilypad” for counter-mine Sikorsky MH-53 helicopters and patrol craft.

There are reports that the Navy may use mine-detecting dolphins. The dolphins are trained to identify the underwater objects, including mines.  Once a mine is spotted by a dolphin, it drops an acoustic transponder nearby. Destruction of the mines is left to human divers.  “*Dolphins – – which possess sonar so keen they can discern a quarter from a dime when blindfolded and spot a 3-inch metal sphere from 370 feet away — are invaluable minesweepers*,” [reported](http://articles.sfgate.com/2003-03-27/news/17483174_1_marine-mammal-program-qasr-mines) *The San Francisco Chronicle.*
