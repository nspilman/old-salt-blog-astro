This sounds like the title of a made-for-TV movie from the SyFy channel.  JEROS, [Jellyfish Elimination Robotic Swarm](http://www.kaist.edu/english/01_about/06_news_01.php?req_P=bv&req_BIDX=10&req_BNM=ed_news&pt=17&req_VI=4488), are jellyfish-shredding semi-autonomous robots designed by [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.kaist.edu/english/01_about/06_news_01.php?req_P=bv&req_BIDX=10&req_BNM=ed_news&pt=17&req_VI=4488) (KAIST) to round up jellyfish in nets and shred thousands per hour.  We recently [posted about a Swedish nuclear power plant that had been shut down by a swarm of moon jellyfish](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/10/jellyfish-invasion-paralyzes-swedish-reactor-sign-jellyfish-apocalypse/).  JEROS could be the first line of defense against a jellyfish horde. Then again, depending on the jellies, it could make matters worse.

On the other hand, some care may be in order. Jellyfish biologist Rebecca Helm notes that shredding certain types of jellyfish can result in more jellyfish.  Like sowing mythical dragon’s teeth, cutting open some jellies results in artificial fertilization, which is to say many more jellyfish. She notes, “best to check what species you’re going to drive robots through before you do a killing sweep, otherwise next year you’re gonna need much bigger robots…”
