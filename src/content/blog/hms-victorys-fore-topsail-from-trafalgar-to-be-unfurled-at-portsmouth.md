![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/victoryforesail.jpg)On July 21, the fore topsail set on [HMS *Victory*](https://www.hms-victory.com/) at the [Battle of Trafalgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar) of 1805 will go on display in all its perforated glory. The sail has 90 shot holes and will be displayed for a limited time over the summer at the [Portsmouth Historic Dockyard](https://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/). The sail’s area is 3,618 feet, equivalent to the size of two tennis courts.

Matthew Sheldon, Director of Heritage at the NMRN, said: ‘HMS Victory, Nelson and the Battle of Trafalgar are key to our history. The sail is an amazing object, scarred by battle and, like HMS *Victory* herself, a proud survivor of an iconic battle. ‘But it is also a vast handmade object from Georgian times that required great skill and knowledge to create. Seeing it is a real treat.’
