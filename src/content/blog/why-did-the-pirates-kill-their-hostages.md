USS Sterett

Why did the pirates kill their for American hostages aboard the sailing yacht *Quest*?   We may never know.  Naval officers are speculating  that the close approach of the destroyer [USS *Sterett*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Sterett_\(DDG-104\)) may have panicked some of the pirates.  The *Sterett* reportedly drew closer to the *Quest* as the radio batteries aboard the yacht were growing weaker and the destroyer wanted to maintain contact.   The pirates were told that that was the reason the destroyer was approaching.   The pirates may have been aware that the last time the US Navy rescued a US citizens held by pirates, Captain Richard Phillips from the Maersk Alabama,  the three pirates were killed by snipers firing from the deck of a destroyer.  
  
There appears to have been division among the pirates themselves.   As the *Sterett* approached, a rocket propelled grenade was fired at it from the *Quest.* Then gunshots were heard aboard the yacht.   As the gunfire broke out, a number of pirates came on deck and moved to the bow of the boat with their hands in the air, suggesting surrender. When the US commandos stormed the ship, the commandos killed two pirates who resisted and found the four hostages mortally wounded along with two pirates who had apparently also been shot by their associates.   One naval officer commented, “Those two may have wanted to surrender — we just don’t know yet. ”
