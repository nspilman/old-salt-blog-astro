![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/zebu2.jpg)Attempts to salvage the historic [tall ship *Zebu*](https://tallshipzebu.org/) have failed. Last week, the 100′ long brigantine, built in Sweden in 1938, [broke from its moorings and drifted onto the Holyhead New Harbour breakwater](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/05/historic-tall-ship-zebu-aground-flooded-on-holyhead-breakwater/#more-57597) in Wales, where she became hard aground. Attempts to save the ship were thwarted by a storm that hit Holyhead on Friday, with winds of up to 70 miles per hour, subjecting the already damaged ship to a horrendous pounding by both wind and sea. *Zebu* suffered further devastating damage in the storm. The captain then had to make the difficult decision to declare *Zebu* a wreck. Nature had now had the final say.

A [statement from the owners](https://tallshipzebu.org/official-statement-21st-may-21/) went on to say “From here onwards, she will be removed with some speed from the sea wall at Holyhead because the harbour master and port authorities will have legitimate concerns regarding the safety of other vessels and possible pollution in this busy, commercial port.”
