Royal Clipper

We have posted about new ventures to return commercial sail to the seas, including the brigantine [*Tres Hombres*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/07/23/tres-hombres-under-sail/) and the [ketch *Irene*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/02/15/irene-sets-sail-with-ale-oil-for-brazil/). We have posted about new designs for large ships from [rigid sails](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/07/10/the-return-of-commercial-sail-ut-wind-challenger-retracting-rigid-wing-sails/) to the [Dyna-rig](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/07/02/the-return-of-commercial-sail-dyna-rig-design-in-the-news/), as well as smaller ship undertakings [B9](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/11/britain-set-to-introduce-sailing-ships-to-counter-emissions-or-maybe-not/) and the [Greenheart project](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/09/02/greenheart-project-crowdfunding-help-build-the-first-greenheart-ship/).  We have also posted about traditional sailing vessels still in service around the world, from the [Bugis phinisi](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/12/where-the-age-of-sail-never-ended-the-bugis-phinisi-an-appreciation/) to [Arab sailing dhows](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/23/racing-of-the-dhows-in-abu-dhabi-the-volvo-ocean-racers/). Nevertheless, we were reminded recently by an article in the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/the-song-of-the-royal-clipper/2012/09/20/e8ad594a-9f7f-11e1-952b-57ee08f4af2e_story.html), that we have largely ignored the largest commercial sailing vessel now in service on the world’s oceans and only the second five masted ship-rigged windjammer – the [*Royal Clipper*](http://www.starclippers.com/en/our-fleet/royal-clipper.html).  The ship was designed by Zygmunt Choreń and built by [Star Clippers Ltd](http://www.starclippers.com/). of Sweden using an existing hull.  The ship was inspired by the only other five masted ship-rigged windjammer  – the  [Preußen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preu%C3%9Fen_\(ship\)), built for F. Laeisz in 1902.

Despite setting 56,000 square feet of sail, the crew required is relatively small. The square sails furl within the yards and are set and furled hydraulically. The staysails and jibs are raised using electric winches which are still hand-tailed by the crew or passenger volunteers.
