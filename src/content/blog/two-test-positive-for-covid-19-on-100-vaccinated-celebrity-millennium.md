![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/06/cmillenium.jpg)When the cruise ship [*Celebrity Millennium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_Millennium) departed from St. Maarten on June 5 for a seven-night cruise visiting Aruba, Curacao, and Barbados, each of the 600 passengers (over 12 years old) and 700 crew members had been fully vaccinated and had been recently tested for Covid-19. Nevertheless, yesterday the [cruise line announced that two passengers had tested positive](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2021/06/10/cruise-covid-celebrity-vaccine/) for the virus. The two infected passengers had shared a stateroom and are reported to be asymptomatic. They have been isolated and are receiving medical care.

How did the two passengers become infected? While the vaccines are highly effective, they are not 100%. A small number of so-called breakthrough cases have been observed. There were apparently a few unvaccinated children onboard the ship as well.

Are these two cases an indication of failure or success? It may be too soon to say. So far, contact tracing has not revealed any other cases. End of cruise Covid-19 testing currently underway for all passengers should also reveal whether the virus has spread. If there are no more cases reported the cruise might be seen as a successful demonstration of herd immunity.

If so, the outcome would be in stark contrast to the Covid-19 outbreak on the *[Diamond Princess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_on_Diamond_Princess)* in February 2020, when a single infection spread to 712 people out of 3,711 passengers and crew aboard, killing 14 passengers.
