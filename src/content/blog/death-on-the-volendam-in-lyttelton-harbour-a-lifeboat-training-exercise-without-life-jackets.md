Lifeboat on Volendam

**Update:** While originally reported that two crew members were knocked overboard during “a lifeboat training exercise,” it is now being reported that the sailors were performing lifeboat maintenance. The commenter (below) reports that both men were wearing safety harnesses which failed. Apparently, the question is not why the sailors were not wearing life jackets but rather why their safety gear failed to prevent their fall.

Original post: A strange and tragic story about a safety drill that turned deadly.   Two crew members were knocked overboard during what is described as a “lifeboat training exercise” on the [Holland American cruise ship, Volendam,](http://www.hollandamerica.com/cruise-vacation-onboard/Volendam) in Lyttelton Harbour, New Zealand, when a lifeboat fall cable snapped.  One crew member drowned. Both men were reported to be wearing heavy clothing, overalls and boots but no lifejackets.
