On a day distracted by a momentous national election, here is something wholly unrelated — the beautiful creatures called [velella velella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velella). As lovely as they are, these jellyfish, also known as “purple sailors” or “by-the-wind sailors,” can be an unwelcomed visitor. Last spring, [velella velella by the thousands](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/02/us/jellyfish-invade-south-florida-irpt/index.html) drifted onto Hallandale Beach, about 18 miles north of Miami. 

“This happens about every three years. We are flying our Purple flag for dangerous marine life,” city officials said on [social media](https://www.facebook.com/CityOfHallandaleBeach/photos/a.1426606444252419.1073741828.1426545144258549/1718265131753214/?type=3). Similar incidents occurred on Pacific Northwest beaches in 2015.
