![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/02/Sailors_valetine.jpg)Happy Valentines Day!   Yesterday, the [Penobscot Marine Museum](http://www.penobscotmarinemuseum.org/) in Searsport, Maine held a sailor’s valentine workshop.  ([See our previous post.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/29/sweetheart-cruise-and-sailors-valentines/))   [Sailors’ valentines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor's_Valentines) were traditionally octagonal wooden boxes with a glass front,  with intricate symmetrical designs inside, often made of shells and carved and polished woods or ivory.  They were particularly popular in the 1830s to 1850s.   While the name suggests that the  boxes were made by sailor’s for their loved ones, many of the “valentines” were made in Barbados.  [Antique sailors’ valentines](http://www.antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request=178) have become quite valuable. For beautiful, more modern, sailor’s valentines check out the work of [Sandy Morgan](http://www.sailorsvalentinestudio.com/art_gallery.htm) and [Lynda Susan Hennigan](http://www.lyndasusanhennigan.com/index.htm).
