On an overcast Thursday morning, the 122-foot top-sail schooner Lynx arrived at North Cove in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River. [See our recent post.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/10/20/schooner-lynx-americas-privateer-arriving-in-nyc-to-commemorate-the-anniversary-of-the-war-of-1812/) She will be open to the public for dockside tours and sails on Saturday and Sunday, weather permitting.  Public sails scheduled for Monday are looking less likely with the approach of Hurricane Sandy.   [For schedules and tickets click here](http://www.privateerlynx.com/calendar.html).  A few photos, click on the thumbnails for larger images:
