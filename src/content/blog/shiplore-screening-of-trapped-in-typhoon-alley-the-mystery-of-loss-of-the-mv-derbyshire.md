![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/derbybanner.jpg)The disappearance of the Capesize bulk carrier [MV *Derbyshire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Derbyshire) in Typhoon Orchid shocked the shipping industry.  How a new, large and well-built ship with a trained crew could have simply vanished became a mystery that would take more than 20 years to solve.  

On Monday, March 18th, New York’s Shiplore is screening [Trapped in Typhoon Alley](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/disasters-at-sea/trapped-in-typhoon-alley/1005669/3467453), episode one of a new documentary series “[Disasters at Sea](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/disasters-at-sea/1005669)” produced by Exploration Production Inc. in association with Smithsonian Networks and Discovery Channel (Canada). The documentary looks at the sinking of the MV *Derbyshire* in 1980 and the two decades of investigations which followed before the mystery of her sinking was finally solved. I was fortunate enough to appear briefly as an expert commenter in the documentary. I will be providing additional commentary on the sinking and investigations before and after the documentary. 

If you are in the area, stop by 80 White Street, Monday, March 18th at 7:30 PM.
