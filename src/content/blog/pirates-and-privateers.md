This Sunday at noon, [CBCs “Land and Sea](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/)” has another very interesting documentary scheduled – [Pirates and Privateers](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/2012/03/pirates-and-privateers.html).  (We recently posted about “[Rum Running](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/2012/02/rum-runners.html),” a excellent documentary which is [now available on-line](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/2012/02/rum-runners.html).)  The [Pirates and Privateers](http://youtu.be/5HoGj0TjYkg) trailer, below, looks interesting.  I will be watching with a certain degree of skepticism as too often these days folks tend to blur the line between privateering and piracy.  Based on their previous work I suspect that “Land and Sea” will do a better job than most.   If you are like I am and out of the range of the CBC, the documentary will be available on-line a few days after the broadcast.
