![stoelnbass](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/stoelnbass.jpg)Last summer, 29 year old Matthew Clark almost won the latest [Bailiwick Bass Club Open Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/events/318705308219847/) in Guernsey.  The almost 14 pound fish that he presented at the weigh in should have the won the the £800 first prize if one of the judges had not recognized the fish, which had two distinctive markings on its head. The fish had apparently been stolen from the local [Guernsey Aquarium](http://www.visitguernsey.com/article/104358/Guernsey-Aquarium) where Clark was an employee.  The fish thief was taken into police custody.  The bass, unfortunately, died before it could be returned to the aquarium.  The case came to court last week and [as reported by the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-20983755), Clark “*was sentenced at Guernsey Magistrate’s Court on Thursday, for theft and fraud.*”  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing on this felonious fish story.
