![fourchaplains](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/02/fourchaplains.jpg)On February 3, 1943, the troopship [SS *Dorchester*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Dorchester) was in a convoy bound for Greenland when it was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat. Of the 904 soldiers and crew aboard, 672 died. Among the dead were [four US Army chaplains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Chaplains) who comforted the living and the dying and helped soldiers board lifeboats and rafts. The chaplains gave their life jackets to soldiers without them. [As the ship went down](http://www.army.mil/article/34090/Chaplain_Corps_History__The_Four_Chaplains/), survivors in nearby rafts could see the four chaplains — arms linked and braced against the slanting deck. Their voices could also be heard saying prayers and singing hymns. The four chaplains were Methodist minister Reverend [George L. Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_L._Fox), Reform Rabbi [Alexander D. Goode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_D._Goode), Roman Catholic priest [Reverend John P. Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._Washington), and Reformed Church in America minister Reverend [Clark V. Poling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_V._Poling).

Their backgrounds, personalities, and denominations were different from one another, although Goode, Poling, and Washington had served as leaders in the Boy Scouts. They met at the Army Chaplains School at Harvard University, where they prepared for assignments in the European theater, sailing on board Dorchester to report to their new assignments.

On May 28, 1948, the [United States Postal Service issued a special stamp](http://www.homeofheroes.com/brotherhood/chaplains.html) to commemorate the brotherhood, service, and sacrifice of the Four Chaplains.

From the [Chaplain Corp History page](http://www.army.mil/article/34090/Chaplain_Corps_History__The_Four_Chaplains/): *Although the Distinguished Service Cross and Purple Heart were later awarded posthumously Congress wished to confer the Medal of Honor but was blocked by the stringent requirements which required heroism performed under fire. So a posthumous Special Medal for Heroism, The [Four Chaplains’ Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Chaplains%27_Medal), was authorized by Congress and awarded by the President on January 18, 1961. It was never given before and will never be given again.*

The [Four Chaplains Memorial Foundation](http://www.fourchaplains.org/) in Philadelphia maintains the Chapel of the Four Chaplains, which since the late 1940’s has been telling the story of the Four Chaplains and encouraging selfless sacrifice and interfaith cooperation.  The Foundation also offers a range of programs and scholarships in honor of the Four Chaplains.
