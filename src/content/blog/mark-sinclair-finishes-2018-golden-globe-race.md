![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sinclair1.jpg)On May 27, 2022, Australian solo sailor [Mark Sinclair](https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/boat-events/golden-globe-race/mark-sinclair-golden-globe-race-2022-skipper-79955), 63, finished the [2018-2019 Golden Globe Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Golden_Globe_Race). He finished last and took four years to complete the race, but he finished, which is an accomplishment in its own right. 

Sinclair had made it halfway around the world before [pulling out of the race in Australia](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=51249&action=edit) in December 2018. He calculated that he had taken too long to reach the halfway point in the race and at his current average speed would arrive too late in the season at Cape Horn. Earlier in the race, Sinclair had run perilously low on freshwater.

He restarted the race on December 5, 2021 from his home port of Adelaide and took 174 days to sail from Australia to Les Sables d’Olonne in France, arriving on 27 May.

Under the race rules, he was allowed to restart, but in the Chichester Class for entrants who make one stop. In total, he has spent 332 days at sea.

[Yachting Monthly](https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/boat-events/golden-globe-race/mark-sinclair-last-finisher-in-the-2018-golden-globe-race-87165#l3pxlb3m19gufbpzzl1) reports that Sinclair, who endured 50 knot winds and 6 metre seas when he rounded Cape Horn, as well as damage to his 1980 Lello 34, *Coconut* said he felt ‘relief’ at arriving in Les Sables d’Olonne, adding that the race was ‘bloody hard but a really good experience.’

‘It gets to the stage when you are just sailing and it doesn’t matter. A day extra doesn’t matter; the sun rises and sets, the moon waxes and wanes, but I really don’t like rough weather and I had a lot,’ he said.

He said he now had ‘a list of jobs to do’ and this would determine if he would race in the 2022 Golden Globe Race, which starts on 4 September 2022. He had originally planned to finish the 2018 race in April.
