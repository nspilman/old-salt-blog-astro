![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/costaconcordia.jpg)An Italian court has convicted five people of manslaughter related to the sinking of the cruise ship *Costa Concordia* in January 2012, which killed 32 passengers and crew.  Each of the five agreed to plea bargains and none may serving jail time.  Captain Schettino is being tried separately. His trial is ongoing.

*The five defendants were Roberto Ferrarini, director of the Italian cruise company’s crisis unit, cabin service director Manrico Giampedroni, first officer Ciro Ambrosio, Indonesian helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin and third officer Silvia Coronica.*

*They received prison sentences ranging from 18 months to two years and 10 months as the court agreed to plea bargains in order to avoid a lengthy trial.*

*The heaviest sentence was given to Roberto Ferranini who was ashore as the disaster unfolded and in charge of co-ordinating the cruise ship company’s response to the crisis.*

*None is likely to go to jail as sentences of under two years are suspended in Italy, while longer sentences may be appealed or replaced with community service, Reuters cited judicial sources as saying.*
