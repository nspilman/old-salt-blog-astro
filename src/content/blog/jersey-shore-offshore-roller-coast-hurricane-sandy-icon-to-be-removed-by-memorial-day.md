![starjet](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/04/starjet.jpg)The roller coasters on the [Casino Pier](http://www.casinopiernj.com/) in [Seaside Heights, New Jersey](http://www.seaside-heightsnj.org/) have long been a major attraction of the Jersey shore resort town. The latest roller coaster on the pier, the [Star Jet](http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/coasters/starjet_casino) (also referred to as the Jet Star,) was installed in 2002. It is steel, 52 feet high, had a top speed of 45 mph and a drop of 1,500 feet. Last November, storm waters from Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of Casino Pier and swept the roller coaster and three other rides into the Atlantic Ocean just off the beach. For the last six months it has become an attraction in its own right, a symbol of the power of Hurricane Sandy. Now the family that owns the amusement park has contracted with [Weeks Marine](http://www.weeksmarine.com/) to remove the roller coaster and other rides from the ocean before tourist season begins on Memorial Day. While there has been some support for leaving the roller coast in the ocean, that was vetoed by local officials over safety concerns.  Thanks to [Mai Armstrong on the Working Harbor Committee blog](http://workingharbor.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/weeks-marine-contracted-to-remove-sandy-damaged-seaside-coaster/) for pointing out the news. Video of the coaster before and after the storm, after the jump.
