![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mculloch.jpg)Researchers are holding [a news conference today to announce the discovery](http://www.scpr.org/news/2017/06/13/72853/historic-shipwreck-discovered-off-southern-califor/) of the wreck of the [USRC/USCGC McCulloch,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_McCulloch_\(1897\)) a cutter of the United States Revenue Cutter Service and later the US Coast Guard.  Delivered in 1897,  just before the start of the Spanish-American War, she was initially transferred to the US Navy and served under Commander Dewey’s Asiatic Squadron in the Battle of Manila Bay.    

The *McCulloch* later patrolled the West Coast and later helped to enforce fur seal regulations in the Pribilof Islands off the coast of Alaska, where it also served as a floating courtroom in remote areas. In 1915, she was transfered to the US Coast Guard, the Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Life-Saving Service were merged to form the Coast Guard.  In 1917 with the US’s entry into World War I, the *McCulloch*  was transferred back to the US Navy. 

The *McCulloch* sank on June 13, 1917, 3 miles northwest of Point Conception, California, after colliding with a civilian steamship.
