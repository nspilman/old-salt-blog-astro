![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sspaloalto.jpg)Over the weekend, winter storm Kori sent record high waves smashing into the California coast. The National Weather Service said a new wave record was set as the Monterey Bay buoy recorded 34-foot waves. At Seacliff State Beach in Aptos, California, the [storm waves tore the stern off](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/23/historic-concrete-ship-s-s-palo-alto-smashed-in-half-by-record-calif-storm-waves/?utm_term=.d110bce83374) the [SS *Palo Alto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Palo_Alto), a concrete ship built as a tanker in 1919, at the end of World War I.  A storm last winter had rolled the ship to starboard and had cracked the hull. This weekend’s storm may have delivered the coup de grâce.

The SS *Palo Alto* had a strange but interesting career. Although she was built as a tanker, by the time she was delivered, World War I had ended, so the ship was laid up for a decade, until it was purchased as an “amusement” ship.  The *Palo Alto* was towed to Aptos, California on Monterrey bay. In 1930, the ship was sunk in a few feet in the water off the beach and a pier was built to the ship. Operated by the Seacliff Amusement Corporation, she was refitted a dance floor, a swimming pool and a café. 

In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the company went bankrupt. The state of California took over the ship, stripped her and turned her into a fishing pier, which operated until 1950, when the deteriorating condition of the ship made her unsafe. An attempt at restoration in the 1980s allowed her to be reopened as a fishing pier for a few more years, but then she was shut down again. The ship was briefly opened for foot traffic in 2016.

SS Palo Alto is known locally as the “[Cement Boat](http://www.californiabeaches.com/ss-palo-alto-concrete-ship/).” She is one of a dozen ferrocement ships under construction during World War I. None were completed in time to serve in the war.  Concrete ships were constructed in both World War I and World War II when steel was in short supply.  They were not notably successful, as they were limited in deadweight and had a tendency to crack.
