![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/08/friday132-200x172.jpg)A repost from several years ago. Sailors have long considered Friday to be an unlucky day and Friday the 13th, particularly so. On this Friday the 13th, it seems appropriate to remember the unlikely tale of [HMS *Friday*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Friday).

Sometime in the 1800s, it is said that the Royal Navy decided to dispel the stigma attached to Friday. They commissioned a ship and named it the HMS *Friday*. Her keel was laid on a Friday, she was launched on a Friday, and she set sail on her maiden voyage on Friday the 13th, under the command of a Captain James Friday. She was never seen or heard from again.

While this is an oft-told tale, none of it is true. There has never been a Royal Navy ship named *Friday*, or any other day of the week, for that matter. HMS *Ark Royal*, on the other hand, [was relaunched on Friday, June 13, 2001](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/1409082.stm), following a major overhaul and continued successfully for another decade before she was decommissioned in 2011.  Happy Friday the 13th.
