![sleepingspermwhale](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sleepingspermwhale.jpg)How do whales sleep? And do they dream? Many years ago on a kayaking trip on Blackfish Sound off Vancouver Island, our group of paddlers came across a pod of “sleeping” orcas. The pod was swimming very slowly, each orca swimming close to the next, diving and surfacing in the same sequence. Near the center of the pod was a baby orca, supported on either side by two females.  This type of resting behavior is also common with dolphins. Apparently, [the dolphin or orca will shut down half of its brain,](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-whales-and-dolphin/) and keep eye open, to stay at least partially aware of predators, or other threats. After about two hours, the whale will switch sides, shutting down the other half of its brain and opening the other eye.

In the last few years, [scientists have observed whales in a deeper form of sleep](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/08/sperm-whales-sleep_n_1757951.html), where it appears that both sides of their brains have been shut down, similar to humans while sleeping. Sperm and humpback whales have been observed sleeping, hanging vertically in the sea, for ten to twenty minutes. Scientists have also observed Rapid Eye Movement (REM) which in humans is characteristic of dreaming.  Do whales dream? And if so of what?

*During a research project throughout January to April 2014 we encountered a sleeping Humpback Whale and managed to get an in water encounter with her. This is a short clip of a 20 minute encounter showing her come up to breath and check us out.*
