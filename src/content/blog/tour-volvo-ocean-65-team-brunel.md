Here is a fascinating tour of the Volvo Ocean 65*Team Brunel*, one of seven identical yachts now racing around the world in the Volvo Ocean Race. The Volvo Ocean 65s are high-performance one-design racers created by Farr Yacht Design and built by a consortium of four European boatyards. They are carbon fiber speed demons. While racing yachts are generally spartan, these black carbon beasts strike me as bordering on grim. The Volvo is not a pleasure sail.
