![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wGennaker_small1.jpg)The [US Central Command announced this morning](http://www.centcom.mil/press-releases/u-s-forces-respond-to-gunfire-aboard-the-s-v-quest) that four Americans aboard the hijacked sailing vessel *Quest* were shot and killed by pirates at approximately 1 a.m. EST today.  The victims were Jean and Scott Adam, the owners of the yacht,  and Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle, who had signed on as crew.   “*We express our deepest condolences for the innocent lives callously lost aboard the Quest*,” said Marine Gen. James N. Mattis, U.S. Central Command Commander.  
  
Four U.S. Navy warships; the aircraft carrier *[USS Enterprise](http://www.enterprise.navy.mil/)*, the guided-missile cruiser [*USS Leyte Gulf*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Leyte_Gulf) and the guided-missile destroyers *[USS Sterett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Sterett_\(DDG-104\))* and *[USS Bulkeley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bulkeley_\(DDG-84\))*; had  shadowed  the hijacked yacht for the last three days.  As negotiations with the pirates  for the release of the hostages were ongoing, shots were heard from onboard the yacht.  When Navy personal stormed the boat,  the four American hostages were found to have been shot by their captors.   Of the 19 pirates believed to be involved in the hijacking, four are dead and the rest are in custody.
