![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/naright.jpg)2017 was a disastrous year for the North Atlantic right whale and 2018 looks no better. In fact, it could be worse. Last year 17 North Atlantic right whales, died which is more than died in the past five years combined. Even worse, during this year’s breeding season, which typically runs from November through February, no newly-born calves have been sighted.

The [Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/02/25/after-year-record-deaths-right-whales-produce-new-calves-which-could-catastrophic/wzPwtQSk9iRDlIvmaFp5nJ/story.html) quotes Barb Zoodsma, a biologist who oversees the right whale recovery program in the Southeast for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “This is the worst-case scenario. This season appears to be a total bomb. You don’t have to be a math major to see that things are going in the wrong direction.”

Between 2010 and 2016, [85 percent of diagnosed whale deaths](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2018/02/the-trump-administration-just-got-sued-over-an-unusual-mortality-event-in-the-ocean/) were the result of entanglement in commercial fishing nets and gear. Vessel-strikes are also a frequent cause of right whale deaths. NOAA researchers are calling the sharp upturn in whale deaths last year an “unusual mortality event.”

The Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, and the Humane Society have filed a lawsuit alleging that President Trump’s Department of Commerce, of which NOAA is a branch, is in violation of the 1973 Endangered Species Act and the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act over their management of the North Atlantic lobster fishery, which “frequently entangles right whales,” according to the suit.

Of the only 450 surviving North Atlantic right whales, there are only about 100 breeding females. If the current trend continues the species could be extinct with 25 years.

[Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2018/02/the-trump-administration-just-got-sued-over-an-unusual-mortality-event-in-the-ocean/) reports: “*The scariest part is that North Atlantic right whales aren’t the only whale species dying off in unprecedented numbers. NOAA recently announced that humpback whales and minke whales have also experienced “unusual mortality events” in the past year. To put that in context, between 1991 and 2018, the agency has declared a total of 65 marine mammal “unusual mortality events.” Of the three events declared since the start of 2017, all have been in response to whale deaths*.”
