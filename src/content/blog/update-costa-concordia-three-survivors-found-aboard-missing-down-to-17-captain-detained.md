The ship’s captain, [Francesco Schettino](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16568037), 52, has been arrested, and is being detained in the nearby town of Grosseto on charges of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship.  The captain claims that the ship was on course but had hit uncharted rocks, an assertion vigorously denied by local authorities.
