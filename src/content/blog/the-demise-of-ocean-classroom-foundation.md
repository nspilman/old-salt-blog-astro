As reported by [The Bangor Daily News](https://bangordailynews.com/2014/07/25/news/portland/financially-strapped-maine-based-ocean-classroom-foundation-to-close/) and the [Portland Press Herald](http://www.pressherald.com/2014/07/26/debt-sinks-ocean-classroom-foundation/), the organization had too much debt, too little cash flow, and two schooners out of service for maintenance and repair.

The OCF owns three schooners, [*Spirit of Massachusetts*](http://oceanclassroom.org/spirit), [*Harvey Gamage*](http://oceanclassroom.org/gamage), and *[Westward](http://oceanclassroom.org/westward).*  Only the *Harvey Gamage* is currently sailing, but is expected to require roughly $100,00 in maintenance at the end of this season. The *Spirit of Massachusetts,* which is currently laid up in Portland*,* is in need of a major overhaul, which is expected to cost roughly $700,000.  Both the *Harvey Gamage* and the *Spirit of Massachusetts* are built of wood.  The *Westward,* which OCF acquired in 2003, is steel and requires a major re-plating, also expected to cost in the range of between $700,000 and $750,000. The *Westward* has not operated for the past two years.

With only one schooner operating, OCF has been unable to to pay the debt service on a $2.2 million mortgage from Camden National Bank. A representative from Camden National is quoted as saying, “The bank is currently working with Ocean Classroom to find a solution that works for both parties.” Tax records show the organization reported to the IRS that its revenue was $1.5 million in 2012, while its expenses were $1.7 million.
