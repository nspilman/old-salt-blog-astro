![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/09/photo_elissa.jpg)The folks at the Pint Jockeys blog have suggested a great way to support the repairs to the [1877 Barque Elissa](http://www.galvestonhistory.org/1877_tall_ship_elissa.asp), which is believed to have been a victim of [stray current electrolytic corrosion](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/07/05/1877-barque-elissa-victim-of-electrolytic-corrosion-needs-3-million-restoration/) resulting from underwater  electrical cable damage after Hurricane Ike.  The folks at Pint Jockeys recommend drinking beer, but not just any beer – [Saint Arnold’s Elissa IPA](http://www.saintarnold.com/beers/elissa.html).  [Saint Arnold Brewing Company](http://www.saintarnold.com/index.html), Texas oldest craft brewery, has named their Indian Pale Ale after the Elissa, the official tall ship of the state of Texas. They are also donating a portion of all Elissa IPA proceeds to Galveston Historic District for preservation of the ship.

And if Saint Arnold’s Elissa IPA is hard to find locally, you can still donate $10 to the *Elissa*  by texting the word “ELISSA” to 50555.   Contributions of any amount can be made on the Galveston Historical Foundation’s web site at [www.galvestonhistory.org](http://www.galvestonhistory.org/ "http://www.galvestonhistory.org/") or by calling 409-765-7834.  Thanks to Kurt Voss for pointing out the Pint Jockeys’ post.
