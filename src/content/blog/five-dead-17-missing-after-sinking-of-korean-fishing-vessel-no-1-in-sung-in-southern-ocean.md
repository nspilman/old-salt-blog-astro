Another ship down.  Speculation is that the Korean fishing vessel *No.1 In Sung* either struck an iceberg or was hit by a large wave off Antarctica.   Twenty surviving crew  members  were  rescued and taken aboard the fishing vessel *No. 707 Hongjin*. Five  are reported dead with seventeen still missing.

[Five dead, 17 missing after sinking](http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/4453908/Five-dead-17-missing-after-sinking)  
  
*The search for survivors from a Korean fishing vessel that sank in the Southern Ocean will continue through the night.*

*The Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ) said three Korean fishing vessels would continue to look for the 17 men still missing after the Korean-owned and operated No. 1 In Sung sank early this morning.*

*Twenty survivors had been recovered, while a further five crew were found dead. Seventeen are still reported missing, taking the possible death toll of the sinking to 22.*

*The 20 survivors and five deceased are now on board the fishing vessel No. 707 Hongjin.*

*Crew members on the fishing vessel included eight South Koreans, eight Chinese, 11 Indonesians, three Filipinos and one Russian, South Korean media reported.*

*Ryan Kim of the Korean company that owned and operated the vessel, Insung Corporation, said he was not holding out much hope for the 17 missing crew.*

*”In my opinion \[survival\] is not possible because it is a long time and the temperature of the water is too low,” he said.*

*He said it was not clear why the vessel sank in about 30 minutes.*

*”We are investigating the reason why the vessel sank because we have not yet heard any evidence. We are guessing a reason might be it hit an iceberg or was hit by a strong wave,” he said.*
