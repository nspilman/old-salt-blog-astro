We can only wish them the best of luck and look forward to trying their rum.

[Rum’s in the family – Ipswich distillery inspired by privateer ancestor](http://www.salemnews.com/business/x740877129/Rums-in-the-family)

*It seems Andrew Cabot has inherited not only his name, but some business sense and a taste for rum from his ancestor.*  
  
*Andrew Cabot, a merchant and privateer who lived 1750 to 1791, rolled barrels of molasses off sailing ships down the pier to his Beverly rum distillery.*

*Six generations later, Cabot’s descendant of the same name has started a rum distillery in nearby Ipswich, using forklifts to heft pallets of cane sugar and custom-made tanks in his Mitchell Road operation.*

*Beverly natives Andrew Cabot and Nelse Clark have started Privateer Rum, a distillery of single-malt whiskey and rum inspired by Cabot’s ancestor. The duo, who have been friends since elementary school, aim to use top-of-the-line ingredients to create a premium product — something they feel is missing in the American rum market.*

*“We’re not producing it the simple way, we’re producing it the hard way,” Clark said. “We believe in an artisanal and handcrafted (product).”*

*“There’s a great joy in making something wonderful and doing it the way you want to do it,” Cabot said.*

*Construction is almost complete at the Privateer Rum distillery, a 6,600-square-foot former wood shop in a Mitchell Road warehouse. They hope to have a finished product to distribute over the summer.*
