![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/surfingwhale.jpg)Most of the 2024 Summer Olympic Games have been held in Paris. The surfing competition, however, took place some 9,800 miles from Paris in the French Polynesian island of Tahiti. 

[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/06/nx-s1-5065479/olympics-surfing-kauli-vaast-caroline-marks-whale) reports that while Brazil’s Tatiana Weston-Webb and Costa Rica’s Brisa Hennessy were waiting for waves in the surfing semifinals, they spotted an unexpected spectator — a humpback whale breaching not far offshore.

“Wow,” breathed one of the commentators as the scene unfolded. “That’s incredible.”

“That’s a 10 right there,” said the other.

American Caroline Mark ultimately brought home the gold for Team USA. Weston-Webb took home silver, and France’s Johanne Defay clinched bronze. Unfortunately, the whale was not awarded a medal.
