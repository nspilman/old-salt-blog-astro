The most common response to the [Hyper-Sub](http://hypersub.com/) is that it looks like something from a James Bond movie. The decidedly strange hybrid craft is a high-speed long-range speedboat which can also turn into a submarine. The craft has a capacity for only five people but boasts speeds of 40 knots and has a range on the surface of 500 miles. Submerged, it can dive to 250 feet. Reportedly, the [US Marines are very interested](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-marines-testing-new-technology-robots-drones-3d-printers-camp-pendleton/) in the Hyper-Sub. No doubt, it would also make a fun toy for a mogul who dreams of pretending to be James Bond.
