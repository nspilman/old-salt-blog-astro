![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/lawmakersillegalorder.jpg)Last week, Sen. Mark Kelly, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, and House Reps. Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander,and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan filmed a short [PSA video message to members of the military](https://youtube.com/shorts/QoW6Hk0BCpY?si=Yl3SCMh62WgxQ1WT). Each of the lawmakers is a veteran of the military or intelligence communities. 

Their message was simple and direct — “You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders.”

The message was nothing new or even controversial. It was taken directly from the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), in which service members are required to obey lawful orders but must refuse orders that are patently illegal. An illegal order is one that violates the Constitution, US laws, or international law, or directs the commission of a crime or unethical act, such as war crimes or the intentional harming of civilians. Refusing an illegal order is a duty, and obeying one can result in criminal prosecution. 

The current president responded in a deranged and wholly unhinged rant. He posted on social media that the video was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.”  H wrote,   
“Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. He later added that the behavior was “punishable by DEATH!” and reshared a post proclaiming: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!.”

Calling for the execution of political opponents for the crime of supporting domestic and international law is typical of a dictator and tyrant. It is also consistent with Trump’s illegal use of government power to seek retribution on his enemies. So far, the mad would-be king has targeted revenge investigations and lawsuits against over [470 of his perceived political enemies.](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-retribution-tracker/)

On Tuesday, the [FBI contacted the US Capitol Police](https://thehill.com/newsletters/5621274-pentagon-goes-after-mark-kelly/) in Washington, DC, to schedule interviews with the six Democrats in question.

The Pentagon warned that it could recall Kelly to active duty to be court-martialed and cited a federal law that bans military retirees against interfering “with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces”.

Legal experts have pointed out that the claim that the lawmakers committed sedition is absurd. Apparently Cadet Bone-Sours does not understand the meaning of the term.

“Sedition is trying to overthrow the government with force or violence,” [Eric R. Carpenter](https://law.fiu.edu/about/directory/profiles/eric-carpenter.html), a professor of law at Florida International University College of Law, said in an email to us. “In the video, the elected officials are just telling service members to follow the law. They are not telling service members to overthrow the government.”
