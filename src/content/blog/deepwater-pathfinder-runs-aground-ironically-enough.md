Deepwater Pathfinder

The [tweet from gCaptain](http://twitter.com/#!/gCaptain) was “Deepwater Pathfinder runs aground” which was linked to a [post on the gCaptain blog](http://gcaptain.com/maritime/blog/deepwater-pathfinder-runs-aground?19154&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:+Gcaptain+\(gCaptain.com\)&utm_content=Twitter) describing how the drill ship ran aground while pulling into Freeport, TX, shearing off a thruster.   Perhaps I am just easily amused, but I was struck by the irony.  Clearly the harbor pilot, who was reported to be aboard, failed to find the pathway to deepwater when piloting the Deepwater Pathfinder.
