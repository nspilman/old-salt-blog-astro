![hollyhock](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/01/hollyhock.jpg)On Sunday, the [USCG Cutter Hollyhock](http://www.uscg.mil/d9/cgcHollyhock/) was conducting an ice escort for six Great Lakes ore boats.in Northern Lake Michigan.  The Hollyhock is a 225 feet long, Juniper Class Seagoing Buoy Tender displacing 2.000 long tons.  Following close behind, perhaps too close as it turns out, was Interlake’s *[Mesabi Miner](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/366904880)*, a 1,000 foot long, 60,000 dwt bulk carrier.

As reported by the [Times Herald](http://www.thetimesherald.com/article/20140105/NEWS05/301050002) :  *The Hollyhock was breaking ice, cutting a line west, and hit a hard spot in the ice, said Keith Showalter, operations specialist first class for the USCG Sector Sault Ste. Marie. The 1,004-foot Mesabi Miner was astern of the Hollyhock and hit the Hollyhock’s stern.  Showalter said the Hollyhock sustained significant damage to its stern and fantail. The Mesabi Miner sustained damage to its bow.*

Fortunately, no one was injured and no pollution was reported.  The *Hollyhock* proceeded to St. Ignace, Mich to undergo a damage assessment. Thanks to Mike Cox for passing the news along.
