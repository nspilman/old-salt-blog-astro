![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/battleshiptexas.jpg)The 110-year-old [Battleship *Texas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Texas_\(BB-35\)) is the oldest remaining dreadnought battleship and only one of six surviving ships to have served in both World War I and World War II. Over the last decade or so, the historic ship has been at the center of a pitched battle just to stay afloat at her berth in the [San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site](https://www.thc.texas.gov/historic-sites/san-jacinto-battleground-state-historic-site) in La Porte, TX. As the saying goes, rust never sleeps.

Soon, the venerable old ship will be moving to Gulf Copper Shipyard in Galveston for long overdue repairs. If all goes well, weather permitting, the ship will be towed to the shipyard on August 31.

KHOU.com reports that teams installed pumps at the end of July that will be used during towing to limit the ship’s water intake from leaks.

Back in May, crews removed about 23,000 cubic yards of mud from the stern around the ship to clear a path for towing into the Houston Ship Channel.

Battleship *Texas* still does not have a permanent home planned after it’s repaired, but we know it won’t be returned to La Porte, where it’s been since 1948. Its new permanent home is likely to be in the Houston area, but Beaumont and Baytown have also been discussed as options.
