![hurricanepat](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hurricanepat.jpg)When Ferdinand Magellan rounded the tip of South America in 1521, he encountered favourable winds. He named the ocean *Mar Pacifico* meaning “peaceful sea” in Portuguese.  Today, [Hurricane Patricia, the most powerful tropical cyclone ever measured in the Western Hemisphere](http://www.weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/hurricane-patricia-mexico-coast), is expected to make landfall on the Mexican west coast near the resort cities of Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo. This morning, the hurricane’s maximum sustained winds were measured an unprecedented 200 mph (320 kph).  [Weather.com](http://www.weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/hurricane-patricia-mexico-coast) reports that  Hurricane Patricia now also holds the record for lowest pressure in any hurricane on record. With a minimum central pressure of 880 millibars (25.99 inches of mercury) at the 4 a.m. CDT advisory, Patricia broke the record of 882 millibars set by Wilma almost exactly 10 years ago. Perhaps, Magellan could have chosen a better name for the, so often, less than “peaceful” Pacific Ocean.
