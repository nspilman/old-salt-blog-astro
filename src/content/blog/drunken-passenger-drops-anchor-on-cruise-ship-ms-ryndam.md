Allegedly, Rick Ehlert, 44, a passenger on the Holland America cruise ship, [MS](http://www.hollandamerica.com/cruise-vacation-onboard/Ryndam;jsessionid=91E80920BB3F320CE9DDE90A982BB008) *[Ryndam](http://www.hollandamerica.com/cruise-vacation-onboard/Ryndam;jsessionid=91E80920BB3F320CE9DDE90A982BB008),* entered a restricted area, put on pair of work gloves, disengaged the windlass and released the stern anchor while the ship was underway, in international waters off the Florida coast early Saturday.   He also threw a lifebuoy overboard.   Ehlert said he was drunk at the time.    He has been arrested on a felony charge of attempting to “damage, destroy, disable, or wreck a vessel.”   Wow.
