![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cowd2.jpg)If you are near New York harbor on Saturday, July 13th, stop by the South Street Seaport, Piers 16 and 17, from 10AM to 4PM, to help celebrate [City of Water Day 2019](https://waterfrontalliance.org/what-we-do/city-of-water-day/#). In its 12th year, City of Water Day is a free harbor-wide day organized by the [Waterfront Alliance](https://waterfrontalliance.org/) in partnership with the [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/), among others. 

The [Con Edison Cardboard Kayak Race](https://waterfrontalliance.org/what-we-do/city-of-water-day/activities/) will return to Lower Manhattan and free PortNYC Boat Tours on all kinds of vessels, from tall ships to tugboats, will be offered from homeport docks throughout New York City.

Dozens of communities in New York and New Jersey will host their own City of Water Day events in celebration of our region’s 1,600 miles of coastline. In collaboration with the [New York-New Jersey Harbor & Estuary Program](https://www.hudsonriver.org/estuary-program), *In Your Neighborhood* events this year include 50 free waterfront events, with nearly 100 participating organizations, across all five boroughs, Westchester County, and New Jersey.

The day’s activities will champion the shared goal of a climate-resilient New York Harbor that is prepared for rising seas and increased coastal storms.
