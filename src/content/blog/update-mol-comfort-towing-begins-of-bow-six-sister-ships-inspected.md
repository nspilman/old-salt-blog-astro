MV Capricorn is towing the forward section of MOL Comfort

[M/V *Capricorn*](http://www.srilankashipping.com/shipprofiles-tugs-boats-mv-capricorn.php), a tug owned by [Sri Lanka Shipping](http://www.srilankashipping.com), is [reported to have the forward section](http://www.vesselfinder.com/news/1239-MOL-COMFORT-UPDATE-Initial-Inspections-show-the-fore-part-leans-forward-drifting-to-India) of the [*MOL Comfort*](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?mmsi=311006900) under tow. The 8,100-teu container ship broke in two last week while under way from Singapore to Jeddah. The forward section of the ship is reported to be trimmed 3 meters by the head, but the water tight bulkheads appear to be intact. The tug [*Pacific Terrier*](http://shipping-data.com/ship/pacific-terrier) is reported to be preparing to tow the after section of the ship. The after section is also said to be in relatively good condition with the engine rooms bullheads intact. An oil sheen is visible around the after section of the ship but [MOL is reporting](http://www.mol.co.jp/en/pr/2013/13042.html) “there is no large volume of oil leakage confirmed.”

The *MOL Comfort*‘s six sister ships, the *MOL Creation*, *MOL Charisma*, *MOL Celebration*, *MOL Courage*, *MOL Competence*, and *MOL Commitment*, are all being inspected “as quickly as possible” by engineers from the shipbuilder, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the classification society, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai.
