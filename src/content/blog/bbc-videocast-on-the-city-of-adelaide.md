We had previously posted about a BBC videocast of a documentary segment about attempts to save the composite clipper *[City of Adelaide](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/07/13/the-city-of-adelaide-the-oldest-just-barely-serving-clipper-ship/)*.   The videocast was available to UK residents only. Thanks to [David Hayes](http://www.historicnavalfiction.net/) for pointing out that the segment has now appeared on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH3QYILDmDg).   Worth watching.
