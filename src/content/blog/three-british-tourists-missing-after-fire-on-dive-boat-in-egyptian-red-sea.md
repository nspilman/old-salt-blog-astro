![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hurricanefire.jpg)The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65871310.amp) reports that three British tourists are missing after a fire broke out on board a dive boat on the Egyptian Red Sea.  

Twenty-six other people, including 12 Britons, were rescued from the boat, called *Hurricane.* Initial reports suggested the fire was caused by an electrical fault. The boat caught fire at about 9 am on Sunday morning in the Elphistone region of the Red Sea, about 25 kilometers north of Marsa Alam.

The boat had been on a dive cruise and had left Port Ghalib on June 6th and been due to return on Sunday. The boat’s operator, Tornado Marine Fleet, said 15 British passengers had been on board along with 12 crew members and two guides.

The rescued tourists were all said to be unharmed while the search continued for the missing.
