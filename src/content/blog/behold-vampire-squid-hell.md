![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/vampiresquidfromhell.jpg)“Vampire Squid from Hell” sounds like a low budget horror movie from the 1950s.  It isn’t. It is a small cephalopod which lives in the deep oceans.

There are two important things that one should know about the species with the scientific name*Vampyroteuthis* *infernalis*, which means, literally, the “vampire squid from hell.”  The creature is not a vampire. Nor is it a squid. Despite the confused taxonomy, the vampire squid is a strange and wonderful creature in its own right.

The vampire squid is neither squid nor octopus but a more primitive form of cephalopod, virtually a living fossil,  dating back to a time before the squid and octopus split into separate orders.  The vampire squid is only about a foot long and lives in deep water in temperate oceans.  It is no bloodsucker. It eats “[marine snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_snow),” organic detritus drifting down from the upper layers of the water column.  Apparently, the creature’s jet-black to pale reddish body was the basis for the vampiric name.
