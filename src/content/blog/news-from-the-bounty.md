*[“HMS” Bounty](http://www.tallshipbounty.org/)*, the replica of the ship of the mutiny fame, built for the [Marlon Brando movie of 1965](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SILFPY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B004SILFPY), is on her way home from her European Summer cruise.  Doug Faunt, with whom I briefly sailed on the *Rose,* has been posting updates of their progress on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/HMS-Bounty/117378731640778).  I particularly liked yesterday’s update, where he detailed their “definite plans.”

***News from the Bounty….definite plans***  
  
*1000Z 10 October 19:57’N 046:12’W motorsailing in a westerly direction at 5 knots*

*In 10 days (or maybe 20) we’ll be at our destination, the North American (or maybe Central or South American) Caribbean (or at least the tropical part of NA (or maybe the sub-tropical part). It’ll definitely be the east side of the continents. And we’re going west (basically), so a lot of the other side of the Atlantic is ruled out (unless someone makes us an offer we can’t refuse.*

*It’s HOT and my cabin is the only one without working air conditioning. But frequent sponge baths, a fan, and private nudity help a lot.* 

*Update: 1700Z 19:55N 046:45W we hove too for swim call. We were joined by a sea bird that’s been accompanying us for a while. The bird was in among our swimmers.- I’m sure photographs will appear.*
