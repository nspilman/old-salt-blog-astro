A combination of economy and ecology, it refers to technology that is good for the ecology, while at the same time making economic sense. The Dutch firm [eConowind](https://www.econowind.nl/) is seeking to apply econology to shipping. We recently posted about the [upcoming installation of two of eConowind’s Ventfoils](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/09/dutch-shipowner-investing-in-new-ventifoil-wind-assist-technology/#more-53405) on the 3,600 DWT general cargo vessel *Ankie*, operated by Van Dam Shipping.

While the Ventfoils on the *Ankie* will be fixed, eCononsail also offers an innovative modular sail-assist product, which they developed by literally thinking inside the box.

The modular eConowind unit features two Ventfoils which are mounted in a 40′ shipping container, that can quickly be placed and removed, providing a flexible solution for a variety of vessels such as general cargo vessels, tankers or other vessels with room for one or two 40 ft sea container(s).

From their [website](https://www.econowind.nl/index.php/econowind-unit/): The Ventifoil is a wing-shaped element using modern innovations in aerodynamics creating high propelling force relative to its size. Smart suction is integrated in the wing, resulting in double the force of the Ventifoil while reefing when needed.

The Ventifoils can be rotated automatically to find the optimal angles relative to the apparent wind. The generated force will be transferred right into the deck and thus helping with propulsion of the vessel. To maintain the ships optimal speed, the engine power can be reduced.

In heavy and/or unfavorable wind conditions the Ventifoils can be easily stored in the container.

All equipment, like hydraulics, automation and ventilation are integrated in the containerized unit. The only support of the vessel to the unit is 400-460 V, 3 phase, 50-60 Hz power connection.
