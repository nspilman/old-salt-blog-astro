10 identical yachts have set sail from Southampton, England to compete in the 40,000-mile (64,500km) Clipper round-the-world race. Many of the crews volunteered as sailing novices, although all have since undertaken a comprehensive four stage training program before setting out on the year long journey. After calling at mainland Europe, the race continues across the Atlantic to South America, before heading for South Africa and on to Australasia. Singapore is the next stop, followed by China, then across the Pacific to California. Passing through the Panama Canal, the yachts will then call at New York, before making for Canada, and finally crossing to Europe once more.

The organisers, headed by renown yachtsman Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, are currently seeking crews for the next race, scheduled to start in 2013.
