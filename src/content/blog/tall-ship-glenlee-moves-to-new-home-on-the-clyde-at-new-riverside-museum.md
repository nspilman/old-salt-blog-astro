*The Glenlee was built in Port Glasgow and took to the sea in 1896, working as a bulk carrier.*

*The vessel is a city landmark and attracts 35,000 visitors a year.*

*The Glenlee is one of only five Clydebuilt sailing ships left afloat around the world. Three are located in the USA – the [Balclutha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balclutha_\(1886\)), the [Moshulu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshulu) and the [Falls of Clyde](https://sites.google.com/a/friendsoffallsofclyde.org/test3/), while the fourth, the [Pommern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommern_\(ship\)), is in Finland.*

*The tall ship has been at Glasgow’s Yorkhill Quay for 12 years, where it has become one of the city’s most popular visitor attractions.*

*The Glenlee will be berthed at Pointhouse Quay alongside Glasgow’s new transport museum and will open to the public on the same day as the Riverside Museum, June 21.*
