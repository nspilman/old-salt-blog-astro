Half of the pod, thought to be pilot whales, are believed to be still alive.

Experts were planning a rescue of the 230 whales discovered on Wednesday but the operation would be “complex” due to the location, Tasmania’s Department of Natural Resources and Environment said in a statement.

[The stranding comes exactly two years](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/21/reports-hundreds-of-whales-stranded-on-tasmanias-west-coast-in-states-second-event-this-week) after [Australia’s worst whale stranding on record](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/25/death-at-hells-gates-rescuers-witness-tragic-end-for-hundreds-of-pilot-whales-on-australian-coast), which occurred in the same location. On 21 September 2020, 470 long-finned pilot whales were found beached on sandbars. A week-long rescue effort saved 111 whales, but authorities had to dispose of more than 350 carcasses.

Wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta [told the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-62976749) the similarities between the stranding and the last one – same species, same location, same time of year – are “unusual” and concerning.

But the reasons behind whale strandings remain a “mystery”, she says, as does why Tasmania sees so many of them.

But the “giant island” itself could just be a navigational hazard for animals that use echolocation, she says.

“You’re going from essentially open waters and then there’s land all of a sudden.”

The current stranding comes a day after a separate mass stranding in northern Tasmania where [14 young sperm whales were found dead](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-62964645) on King Island, in the Bass Strait.
