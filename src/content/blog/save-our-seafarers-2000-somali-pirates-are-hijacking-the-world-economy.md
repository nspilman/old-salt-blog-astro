![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/sosBanner.jpg)In view of the failure of current efforts to combat piracy,  BIMCO, the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the International Shipping Federation (ISF), Intercargo, INTERTANKO and the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) have launched a campaign to [Save Our Seafarers](http://saveourseafarers.net/#topnav) to encourage people around the world to pressure their national governments to crack down on piracy.

From the [Save Our Seafarers](http://saveourseafarers.net/#topnav) website:  
  
*Over 800 seafarers are being held hostage by armed gangs of Somali pirates, in appalling conditions, subject to physical and psychological abuse, for up to 8 months.*

*Their ships have been hijacked at sea and they are being held for ransoms of millions of dollars. The human cost to seafarers and their families is enormous.*

*This affects YOU. Piracy is beginning to strangle key supply routes. 90% of the world’s food, fuel, raw materials and manufactured goods is delivered by sea. Nearly half of the world’s seaborne oil supply passes through the pirate-infested parts of the western and northern Indian Ocean.*

*But the world’s politicians don’t seem to realise the severity of the crisis. World trade is under threat. Piracy costs the global economy $7-12bn a year. Yet even when caught red handed by naval forces, 80% of pirates are released to attack again.*

*You can help stop this hostage-taking and help restore the freedom of the seas. Please add your voice to our worldwide call for government action. More robust laws, stronger enforcement of international conventions and firmer political resolve are needed to stop these pirates.*
