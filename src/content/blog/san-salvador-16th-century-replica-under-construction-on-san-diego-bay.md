At a time when many maritime museums in the United States are struggling to just maintain their ships and indeed several are attempting to get rid of them, the [Maritime Museum of San Diego](http://www.sdmaritime.org/) is building a new historic replica, the *[San Salvador](http://www.sdmaritime.org/san-salvador/)*, [Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Cabrillo)‘s flagship.  In the 16th century, Cabrillo was the first European to navigate the coast of California.  The replica *San Salvador* will be full-sized, fully functional, and historically accurate. The ship is being constructed at Spanish Landing in San Diego, California. Visitors are invited to watch the construction. Once finished the *San Salvador* will remain on exhibit as part of the Museum’s fleet of historic and replica ships and will travel along the California coast as an ambassador for San Diego.
