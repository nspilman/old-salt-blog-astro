![captainconcordia](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/02/captainconcordia-191x200.jpg)After a 19 month trial, [Captain Francesco Schettino has been found guilty](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31430998) of manslaughter associated with the grounding and sinking of the [*Costa Concordia*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/09/update-costa-concordia-captain-schettino-to-blame-crew-and-company-also-at-fault/) in 2012 in which 32 passengers and crew died. Another 150 passengers and crew were injured. Schettino was sentenced to 16 years and one month in prison. The verdict is expected to be appealed.

In 2103, Costa Line’s cabin service director, the *Costa Concordia*‘s first officer, third officer and the ship’s helmsman were [all convicted on various charges under a plea bargain deal](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/07/five-guilty-in-costa-concordia-sinking-captain-schettinos-trial-continues/) in which none has served prison time. Lawyers for the plaintiffs’ lawyers were pleased with Schettino’s conviction, but have complained to the court that no one from the cruise company’s upper management was ever charged with a crime.
