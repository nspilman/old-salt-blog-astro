A new study from the journal [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0179-y.epdf?referrer_access_token=2gf8NZ-34C2CSXGMKgenYNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PBEKqWHTwARrIrR4OxoHFd5WZGh-A0FX8FPbkdWIZLYUm_vJ0o_G6aRmZMNcRN9DIbKJZitDLszCyshEcjJtL_xHqF8u5zfHM_6U0JpKI_jpoTNyR0wwmvxfpHFzZKGkHKXFaxnlWkATUrwyCQ7ie8hHgu14vj1c7TxG5y3NzO4e0bGS4ZSbU9liGdsS977Yj6_lb52mHBs9pU1IjuSnx9&tracking_referrer=www.nytimes.com) makes a terrifying observation — the rate at which Antarctic ice is melting has tripled from only a decade ago. This is significant as more than 60 percent of the freshwater on Earth is locked in Antarctica’s ice sheets. The continent has lost nearly three trillion tons of ice since 1992.

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/climate/antarctica-ice-melting-faster.html) reports that the continent is now melting so fast, scientists say, that it will contribute six inches (15 centimeters) to sea-level rise by 2100. That is at the upper end of what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated Antarctica alone could contribute to sea level rise this century.

Antarctica is not the only contributor to sea level rise. [Greenland lost an estimated 1 trillion tons of ice between 2011 and 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL069666). And as oceans warm, their waters expand and occupy more space, also raising sea levels. The melting ice and warming waters have all been primarily driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases.
