Rubber gloves drying – Portside & the Tanker Mary Whalen help in Red Hook recovery

Like most of the historic vessels in and around New York harbor, the tanker [*Mary A. Whalen*](http://www.portsidenewyork.org/mary_whalen.htm) survived Superstorm Sandy Sandy better than her shore based neighbors. The tanker, which weathered Sandy at the inshore end of Pier 9B in the Red Hook Container Terminal, suffering damage to their shore power supply and the flooding of some of their historic paper records, but otherwise was relatively unscathed. Their shore-side neighbors in the [Red Hook section of Brooklyn](http://nation.time.com/2012/11/01/red-hook-apocalypse-how-sandy-undid-an-up-and-coming-new-york-neighborhood/) were not so fortunate. In response, [PortSide NY](http://www.portsidenewyork.org/index.htm), the waterfront educational organization based on the *Mary Whalen* led by Carolina Salguero, set up a [Recovery Center](http://portsidetanker.blogspot.com/2012/11/portside-hurricane-sandy-recovery-effort.html) at 351 Van Brunt Street shortly after Sandy swept through Redhook. They moved computers, tables, chairs, modems and a printer off the tanker and set charging stations and phone landlines,  The Recovery Center has become a focal point for recovery advice and contacts and serves as a meeting space for volunteers and community groups.
