I have chaperoned my son’s class on a trip on the Hudson River Sloop [*Clearwater*](http://www.clearwater.org/). They have a wonderful program for school groups – teaching kids history, ecology, and a bit of seamanship while also having great fun on a river cruise. On Monday afternoon, they added a new element to the curriculum while sailing near Yonkers and finding unexpectedly shallow waters near the Saw Mill River. The *Clearwater* ran aground, no doubt for neither the first nor the last time. There were no injuries nor damage to the sloop. As the executive director of Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc., Jeff Rumpf, said, “The school group got an extra experience to see how you handle a sailboat in that sitation.”
