A calming post for a spring Sunday. Here is another wonderful time-lapse by [Wes Snyder](https://wessnyderphotography.zenfolio.com/). From the [Youtube description](https://youtu.be/kuS62289TuY): 

*“Capturing Cape Hatteras” is a time-lapse of the Milky Way, crescent moon, and sunrise on March 20th, 2020. Amidst all the concerns of the spreading coronavirus, and our county being shut down to any outside visitors, we decided to head out onto the abandoned beaches of Buxton, NC, for a night of stargazing on Hatteras Island.*
