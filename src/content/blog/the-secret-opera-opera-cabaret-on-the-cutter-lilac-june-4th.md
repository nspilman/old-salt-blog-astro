![secretopera1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/06/secretopera1.jpg)If you are in the area tomorrow night, June 4th, be sure to stop by the [Cutter *Lilac*](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/) at Pier 25 at N.Moore at West Streets on the Hudson River in Manhattan, for Opera Cabaret performed by [The Secret Opera](http://www.thesecretopera.com/#!home/c24yz) between 7 and 8:30 PM.  The performance is free and open to the public.

What is The Secret Opera, one well might ask? George Grella of [New York Classical Review](http://newyorkclassicalreview.com/2014/07/secret-opera-explores-the-lives-of-two-famous-women-characters-uninterrupted/) describes them as “*one of the small, imaginative opera companies rapidly proliferating in New York City. They are nimble, make the most of limited resources, and present talented singers and new works that are outside the physical and financial scope of the Metropolitan Opera.*”  The Secret Opera — Opera Cabaret is part of the [Lilac Arts Series](http://www.lilacarts.org/).

America’s only surviving steam-powered lighthouse tender, the former Coast Guard Cutter *Lilac* is operated as a museum by the non-profit [Lilac Preservation Project.](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/)
