Stuck in Chesapeake Bay mud for more than five weeks, the container ship [*Ever Forward*](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/03/container-ship-ever-forward-aground-in-chesapeake-bay/) is finally free. Refloating the 1,100-foot long ship required discharging 500 containers and additional dredging but she was dragged by seven tugs from the mudbank early on Sunday. Once freed and in the channel, the ship needed to be quickly ballasted to be able to fit under the Bay Bridge. The ship was then anchored to complete a damage survey.
