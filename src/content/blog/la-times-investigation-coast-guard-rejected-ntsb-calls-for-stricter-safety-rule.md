![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/09/diveboatfire.jpg)The [dive boat *Conception*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/09/dive-boat-disaster-34-feared-dead-in-catastrophic-fire-off-santa-cruz-island/) was a death trap.  It was a wooden vessel with a single narrow and steep stairway from the lower berthing deck and a [small emergency exit hatch](https://people.com/human-interest/california-boat-fire-investigator-harrowing-details/). When a fire broke out on September 2, 34 people sleeping on the lowering berthing deck died in the blaze.

The *Conception* was also inspected and approved by the US Coast Guard as meeting all requirements of a Subchapter T, Small Passenger Vessel.  Recently, [an investigation by the Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-12/conception-boat-fire-coast-guard-ntsb-recommendations) revealed that the Coast Guard had repeatedly rejected the National Transportation Safety Board’s (NTSB) recommendations for stricter fire safety regulations in this type of vessel.

Richard Winton and Mark Puente writing in the [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-12/conception-boat-fire-coast-guard-ntsb-recommendations) reported:

*\[The NTSB\] repeatedly has called on the Coast Guard to require small vessels to establish procedures for conducting regular inspections and reporting maintenance and repair needs for all of a boat’s systems — including the hull and mechanical and electrical operations. This, the NTSB said, would better ensure safety on vessels between Coast Guard inspections, which occur every one to two years.*

*But the Coast Guard has pushed back on the recommendation, calling it “unnecessarily burdensome and duplicative of existing requirements.” …*

*A preliminary NTSB investigation found that the Conception had violated a requirement that it have a roving watch during the night, saying the five crew members who survived awoke to discover the flames. The agency also has raised concerns about the functionality of the two exits in the area where passengers slept in stacked bunks beneath the waterline.*

*Even so, the Conception passed Coast Guard inspection, a fact that some say underscores the problem.*

*“Yes, it complied with all the Coast Guard regulations, but that didn’t mean it was safe,” said John McDevitt, a former assistant fire chief and chair of a National Fire Protection Assn. committee on boat fire protection. “A string of recommendations have been ignored about early warning systems, detection, and training.”*
