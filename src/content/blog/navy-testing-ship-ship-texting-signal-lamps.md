![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/signal-lamp1.jpg)In 1867, Royal Navy Captain, and later Admiral, Philip Colomb, worked out a system to send signals by a code of dots and dashed using [signal lamps.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_lamp) Since then, navies around the world have used only slightly improved versions of signal lamps to send secure messages over short distances between ships. The system has lasted because it relatively simple and effective. Nevertheless, signaling with light is not without its problems. The technique is fairly slow and requires trained personnel skilled in the use of Morse Code to make it work.

Now, the [US Navy is testing a high-tech version of the old signal lam](http://newatlas.com/us-navy-signal-lamps-fltc-texting/50523/)ps which use computer operated lights to flash signals, potentially much faster and more accurately than the old manual lamps. Sailors will be able to send messages over the updated signal lamp systems in the same way they send text messages over their smart phones. The devices being tested are referred to as Flashing Light to Text Converter (FLTC) systems. The FLTC is, in some respects, an old and proven technology updated for the iPhone generation.
