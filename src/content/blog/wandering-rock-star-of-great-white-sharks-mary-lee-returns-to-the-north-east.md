In September, a 16 foot long 3,500-pound female great white shark was tagged by researchers off Cape Cod.   The shark was nicknamed Mary Lee.  Since then [Ocearch](http://sharks-ocearch.verite.com/), the group tracking the shark, have followed Mary Lee on a remarkable journey.   The shark swam as far south as Jacksonville Beach, FL in January, causing some alarm as she swam within 200 feet of the beach. Now she has traveled north again and is heading back toward Cape Cod.
