![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/11/mayflower-ii.jpg)Today is celebrated as a day of Thanksgiving in the United States.  At the Old Salt Blog we would like to express our sincere thanks and gratitude to all our readers and contributors, who make putting together the blog such fun. We do appreciate it.

No one agrees when or where the first Thanksgiving celebration took place in North America.  Most point to the [Plimoth Colony](http://www.plimoth.org/) in Massachusetts in 1621 while some argue for [St Augustine, Florida in 1565](http://staugustine.com/stories/112405/new_3476042.shtml).  
  
But what of Thanksgiving at sea?  [Dr. Suzanne O’Connell writes](http://www.sciencebuzz.org/museum/ocean_drilling/thanksgiving_at_sea): *“How do 114 people from a dozen different countries celebrate Thanksgiving in the middle of the ocean? If those people are on the JOIDES* *Resolution**, it’s a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.”* Sounds like quite a feast.

The [Hampton Roads Naval Museum](http://hamptonroadsnavalmuseum.blogspot.com/2010/11/thanksgiving-at-sea.html) has posted two Thanksgiving Day menus from the battleship *USS New York* and the destroyer *USS* *Livermore* during World War II.

Elsewhere on the coast of North Carolina, [oysters are popular at Thanksgiving](http://www.jdnews.com/news/north-85103-carolina-thanksgiving.html), while in Washington State, Jeffrey P. Mayor thinks that, [nothing says Thanksgiving like trying your luck at river fishing](http://www.theolympian.com/2010/11/24/1450623/nothing-says-thanksgiving-like.html).  OK. Hope your waders don’t leak.  And in Florida, [Bathtub Beach is reopening just in time for Thanksgiving.](http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2010/nov/23/bathtub-beach-to-reopen-thanksgiving-day/)

We hope everyone has a wonderful and safe holiday.
