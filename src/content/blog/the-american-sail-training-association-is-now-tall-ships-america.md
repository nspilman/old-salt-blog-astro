![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tall-ships-america-blue-2.gif)The American Sail Training Association is “rebranding.”   They will now be known as [Tall Ships America](http://tallshipschallenge.wordpress.com/).  Everything else will stay about the same.   I have to admit, Tall Ships America does have a nice ring to it while ASTA sounded a bit too much like an insurance company.

[TALL SHIPS AMERICA: The New Face of ASTA](http://tallshipschallenge.wordpress.com/)

*We are proud to announce to our members, supporters and friends that we have adopted a new public identity: Tall Ships America. Our mission is unchanged, and just as we have done since 1973, Tall Ships America will encourage character building through sail training, promote sail training to the North American public and support education under sail.*   
  
*As Tall Ships America, we will carry our proud mission forward under a bright new banner, one that will capture the imagination of the North American public for the 21st century. We hope you will sign aboard Tall Ships America for the next leg of this epic voyage – we are bound for distant horizons of adventure and education under sail.*

Thanks to Dexter Donham at [Sailing Ship Adventures](http://www.sailingshipadventures.com/) for pointing it out.
