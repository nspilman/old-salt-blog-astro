Almost three miles beneath the surface of the Atlantic, deeper than the *Titanic*,  [Odyssey Marine](http://www.shipwreck.net/) has located the wreck of the *[S.S. Gairsoppa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Gairsoppa)*, which was torpedoed in February of 1941 by a German U-boat.  When she sank, the ship was loaded with silver, pig iron and tea. The 240 tonnes of silver aboard are believed to be worth aproximately $200 million (around £155 million.)  Odyssey plans to begin recovery operations in the spring which, if successful, will be the deepest and largest retrieval of a precious cargo lost at sea in history.
