![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/02/South_Street_Seaport.jpg)Great news!  Congressman Jerrold Nadler (NY-10) and the South Street Seaport Museum announced that the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is awarding the museum $10.4 million from FEMA’s Public Assistance Program as part of federal efforts to assist in repairing damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

“We’ve been working for more than two years to secure funding for Sandy recovery. This grant is a strong step in the right direction for the Seaport Museum,” said Captain Jonathan Boulware, the Museum’s Executive Director. “Congressman Nadler’s support of our efforts has been meaningful and we’re encouraged by this news as we undertake larger efforts to improve and expand Museum programming.”

When Superstorm Sandy hit New York City in 2012, the neighborhood around South Street Seaport was especially hard hit. The storm surge of over seven feet of oily saltwater devastated the Seaport District. Due to the efforts of Captain Boulware and his crew, the ships of the South Street Seaport Museum rode through the storm with little damage. The same cannot be said for the historic buildings which housed the museum’s shorebased exhibits.

Elevators, escalators, electrical equipment, and heating and cooling systems were all destroyed. Since that time the Seaport Museum has made significant progress toward recovery. Notable achievements include revitalized education programming (with tripled attendance over last year), increased membership (more than doubled), and the reactivation of the 1893 schooner Lettie G. Howard as a sailing school vessel. In addition, the museum has begun a $10.6 million City-funded restoration of the 1885 ship Wavertree, to be completed next year. “While there is a great deal yet to do, with this support from FEMA we can continue to build toward a bright future for the South Street Seaport Museum,” added Boulware.
