![hudsonseal](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hudsonseal.jpg)Some folks think that those around New York City are unfriendly, which couldn’t be further from the truth. Here is a short video of a seal resting on a patch of ice in the Hudson River waving at Megan Viscovich and her co-workers who spotted the seal from their office overlooking the river in Edgewater, NJ. As reported by [4 New York](http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Seal-Waves-Ice-Hudson-River-New-York-New-Jersey-368880011.html): *“It was a young seal and seemed to be full of life, looked like it was waving and flapping its rear fins,” she said in an email. Viscovich said the Edgewater Fire Department and an NYPD harbor unit responded. The NYPD said its divers worked with Edgewater firefighters to help the seal get back into the river.*
