![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/01/royalclipper.jpg)Here is a look at a modern sailing ship, Star Clipper’s [*Royal Clipper*,](https://www.starclippers.com/us-dom/our-fleet/royal-clipper.html) a high-tech square-rigger whose technology is not always obvious.  Click here for a [photo tour of the *Royal Clipper*](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2018/01/09/photo-tour-star-clippers-royal-clipper-anomaly-world-cruising/1001918001/) recently featured in USA Today.

We recently posted about the high-tech three-masted square-rigger, *[Black Pearl](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/12/high-tech-square-rigger-black-pearl-inspired-maltese-falcon/),* which features a next-generation Dynarig with automated sail trimming and furling. Flexible solar panels are also incorporated into the sails to help meet the electrical needs of the vessel. 

Compared to the *Black Pearl,* the five-masted fully-rigged sailing cruise ship *Royal Clipper* looks almost entirely traditional. This is no accident. The *Royal Clipper* is modeled after the famous Flying P Liner, the five-masted ship [*Preußen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preu%C3%9Fen_\(ship\)) of 1902. 

According to the Guinness World Records, the 439′ *Royal Clipper* is the largest square-rigged ship in service, with 5,202 square meters of sail area (or almost twice that of the *Black Pearl*.)

The *Royal Clipper* sets 42 sails, set on yards and stays in what at first glance looks like a wholly traditional rig. In fact, it is anything but. The 26 square sails can all be set or furled from deck at the push of a series of buttons. The square sails are furled inside the hollow aluminum yards with a hydraulic roller furling system. The yards are trimmed with electric brace winches. 

Furling square sails is not a new idea. Variations on the concept date back at least to at least 1861, with [H.D. Cunningham’s Patent Self-Reefing Topsails.](http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Rigging/Kipping\(1861\)_p168b.html) The advent of hydraulics, electric motors, lightweight spars and stainless steel cable, however, make it possible to fully automate the handling of the square sails carried on the five masts.

The staysails on the *Royal Clipper* are raised with electric deck winches, which allow the passengers to line up on deck and help tail the sheets as the staysails are raised, allowing each participant to go home from the cruise saying that they helped raise the sails on the world’s largest square-rigger.

Whereas the *Preußen* had a sailing crew of around 45, the *Royal Clipper* deck crew is about 20.  (As the Royal Clipper is a cruise ship, the total crew is over 100 to meet the needs of 227 passengers.) Under sail, the *Royal Clipper* is capable of speeds of over 14 knots.

Other technology is not obvious either.  Because passengers make for fussy cargo, the heel of the ship is limited by automatic heeling tanks which also serve as anti-rolling takes when the ship is at anchor. 

The upper sections of the two tallest masts at 60 meters also can fold down to allow the ship to pass under the Queen Elizabeth II bridge on the Thames. The main engine and generator exhausts are vented through the mizzen and jigger masts, well away from passengers or other rigging.

Star Clipper will be adding a new and larger square-rigged cruise ship to its fleet within the next few months. The [*Flying Clipper*](https://starclippers.co.uk/flying-clipper-launch-moved-to-2018.html) will be a 300 passenger ship inspired by the [*France II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_II) of 1911.
