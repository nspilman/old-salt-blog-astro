If you are having a lousy Monday, here is a reminder that things could always be worse. Below is a video of $24 million yacht, 102′ long, M/V *Polar Bear*, which caught fire last Thursday in Chula Vista, near San Diego, CA. The cause of the fire has yet to be determined, but there are reports that a welder was working aboard just before the blaze broke out. The yacht reportedly took five years to build and has been in service for only three years. [The owner, understandably, is described as “devastated.”](http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Chula-Vista-G-Street-Yacht-Fire-263839691.html)
