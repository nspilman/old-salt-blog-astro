Here is a fascinating bit of history from the “History Guy” about when the navies of the [Republic of Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Navy) and the [Republic of the Yucatan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Yucat%C3%A1n) faced off against the most modern warships of their time, the ironclads of the Mexican Navy, the steamers [*Guadalupe*](https://threedecks.org/index.php?display_type=show_ship&id=11583) and *Moctezuma.*  They fought in the [Naval Battle of Campeche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Campeche) in 1843. Remarkably, the battle between the wooden ships and the iron steamers ended in a draw.
