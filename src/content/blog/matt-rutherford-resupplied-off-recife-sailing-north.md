![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/03/mattresupply.jpg)We recently [posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/02/25/matt-rutherford-sailing-singlehanded-around-the-americas-in-need-of-resupply/) about Matt Rutherford needing to be resupplied to continue his attempt to sail single-handed entirely around the Americas in the *St. Brendan*, a 27′ Albin Vega.  Last week, Matt rendezvoused with a small boat, two miles off the coast of Recife, Brazil, which supplied him with a handheld VHF radio for communication, putty to fix a leak, two small solar panels to power his electronics, a hand crank for starting his engine, 15 gallons of diesel fuel, 20 gallons of drinking water, and some fresh food.  With luck, these supplies should allow him to complete the last on the last 3,000 mile leg of remarkable voyage.  Matt has now been sailing for 268 days and has logged 23,433 miles.
