![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sequoia2019.jpg)Back in 2016, [we posted about a new owner](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/11/saga-ex-presidential-yacht-sequoia-continues-new-owner/) for the ex-presidential yacht *[Sequoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Sequoia_\(presidential_yacht\)),* which had been sitting, deteriorating in a boatyard in Deltaville, VA. Now, three years later, the 104′ long motor vessel has been loaded aboard a barge to be transported ultimately to Maine for restoration. The *Sequoia* served as a presidential yacht during the administrations of Herbert Hoover through Jimmy Carter and is a National Historic Landmark. 

The [Waterway Guide](https://www.waterwayguide.com/latest-news/news/10060/sequoia-begins-a-new-voyage) reports that plans are to move the vessel to Cambridge, MD aboard the smaller barge that it is now loaded on and transfer it to a larger one for the trip up the Atlantic coast to a shipyard in Belfast, ME where it will undergo repairs. 

*Sequoia* was originally launched as a private yacht in 1925. She was designed by John Trumpy and built by the  John H. Mathis & Company Shipbuilders in Camden, New Jersey. She was purchased by the US government in 1931 after a brief stint as a naval vessel during Prohibition, became the official presidential yacht in 1933. 

After 46 years of government service, the *Sequoia* was sold at auction in 1977. Since then she has had seven owners. The current owner, [FE Partners LLC, a joint venture between the D.C.-based Equator Capital Group and members of an Indian family](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/a9985564/presidential-yacht-uss-sequoia/) with connections to the mining and shipping industry, acquired the vessel in 2016, after an extended legal battle with the previous owner.

[Waterway Guide](https://www.waterwayguide.com/latest-news/news/10060/sequoia-begins-a-new-voyage) sums up the recent history succinctly: *The story of how Sequoia ended up in Deltaville, VA and why it stayed so long is a tawdry tale with many twists and turns including loan default, a judge awarding ownership to financiers for one dollar, insurance companies battling it out, accusations of malfeasance, raccoons moving onboard, gossip and finger-pointing.*

We can only wish the old yacht our best in her future renovation.
