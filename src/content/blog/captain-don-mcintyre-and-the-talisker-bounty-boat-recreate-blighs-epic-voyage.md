![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/07/t1larg.jpg)[At the end of last April we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/04/29/the-talisker-bounty-boat-begins-its-epic-voyage/) about an [expedition](http://www.bountyboat.com/) led by Australian Don McIntyre to recreate the epic 3,700 nautical mile voyage of Captain Bligh and his crew across the Pacific in an open boat in 1789 following the famous mutiny.   McIntyre and his crew of three set out to recreate the conditions Bligh faced.  The sailed in a 25 foot open boat, surviving on a “starvation diet” of two ship’s biscuits and a bit of tinned beef a day.  They relied on 18th century navigation  but, like Bligh, sailed without charts.   After a seven week voyage where they were almost capsized in gale force winds, narrowly avoided  running up on a reef, and spent hours daily bailing out the small boat, they arrived safely in East Timor yesterday.
