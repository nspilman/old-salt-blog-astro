![halfmoonfront](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/halfmoonfront.jpg)The story is regrettably familiar. A historic vessel, unable to find a suitable berth, is forced to move elsewhere. Yesterday, Chip Reynolds, Director of the [New Netherland Museum](http://www.halfmoon.mus.ny.us/) and Captain of the replica ship, [*Half Moon*,](http://www.halfmoon.mus.ny.us/livinghistory.htm) announced the museum’s intentions to move to the ship to the Hoorn in The Netherlands. The replica of the ship Henry Hudson sailed to the river which now bears his name in 1609 has been unable to find a berth on the river.

As reported by [The New York History Blog](http://newyorkhistoryblog.org/2014/10/09/replica-half-moon-may-move-to-the-netherlands/): *The Half Moon arrived in Albany in 1999 with plans, and the support of then Governor George Pataki, to establish itself permanently on the Albany waterfront. Those plans never came to fruition; Reynolds says they were dropped after 9/11.*

“*We have pursued many options over the years, but none have come to fruition,” according to Reynolds. “While several concepts remain as possibilities, no person or entity in New York has so far been prepared to take ownership of the Half Moon and move forward with a larger plan.”*

*“It is in this context that Andrew Hendricks, MD, the founder and Chairman of the New Netherland Museum, invited representatives from the Westfries Museum in Hoorn, The Netherlands, to visit the Half Moon and consider taking ownership of the vessel for permanent placement at their museum north of Amsterdam,” Reynolds told supporters….*

*The 85-foot Half Moon, boasting three masts, six sails with 2,757 square feet of canvas, six cannons and four anchors, is a replica of the [Halve Maen,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halve_Maen) commissioned in March 1609 for the Dutch East India Company. Hudson, an Englishman, was searching for a passage to the Pacific, when he claimed the area for the Dutch, 10 years before the landing at Plymouth Rock by the Pilgrims.*

The Director of the [Westfries Museum](http://www.westfriesmuseum.info/) in Hoorn has expressed a serious interest in the vessel. A vote by municipal officials on the proposal is expected at a meeting later this year.
