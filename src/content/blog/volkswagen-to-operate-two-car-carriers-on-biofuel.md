![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vwbiofuel.jpg)[Volkswagen Group Logistics](https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2016/12/Volkswagen_Group_Logistics.html) has switched the first of two chartered car carriers from burning heavy fuel to biofuel. The fuel is supplied by Netherlands-based [GoodFuels](https://goodfuels.com/marine/) and is produced primarily from used oil from restaurants and the food industry.

The car carrier *[Patara](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/PATARA-IMO-9491898-MMSI-218818000),* owned by Depth RoRo, was refueled for the first time with 100% GoodFuels’ biofuel in mid-November 2020 and a second ship is due to follow at the beginning of 2021.

“We are the first automaker to make widespread use of this fuel. This way, we reuse waste oil in an environmentally compatible way. With 85% lower CO2 emissions than with conventional fossil fuels, the contribution to climate protection is enormous,” says Thomas Zernechel, Head of Volkswagen Group Logistics.

The two chartered car carriers trade between European ports and carry about 250,000 new vehicles of the Audi, SEAT, Škoda, Volkswagen passenger cars, and Volkswagen commercial vehicle brands every year.

[Marine Log](https://www.marinelog.com/shipping/environment/volkswagen-switches-two-car-carriers-to-biofuels/?utm_source=&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=21922) reports that the two ships, which are both 180 meters long, are each powered by an MAN marine diesel engine developing more than 19,000 hp (14,220 kW). In the future, the two ships are to be refueled at sea off the coast of Vlissingen (Netherlands) with alternative fuel supplied by the Dutch company GoodFuels. This way, the CO2 emissions of the two conventional vessels along their route will be reduced by more than 85% – from over 60,000 to about 9,000 tonnes per year. In addition, sulfur oxide emissions will be almost completely avoided. In addition to dramatically reducing the ship’s carbon footprint, the biofuel cuts sulfur pollution to zero.
