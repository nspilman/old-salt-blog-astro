MSC’s newest passenger ship, the [MSC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSC_Divina) *[Davina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSC_Divina),* recently called at the Venice lagoon setting off a storm of protests. The protesters think that such a large ship creates too much pollution and could damage the fragile environment of the lagoon.

The MSC *Davina* is 139,400 GT, almost 1,100 feet long, about 125 feet wide and carries up to 5,329 passengers and crew, or about 40,000 GT and almost 500 passengers larger than the *[Costa Concordia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Concordia).* 

The  [MSC *Davina* was christened](http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2012/05/29/sophia-loren-christens-msc-divina) at the end of last month by the Italian actress [Sophia Loren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Loren).  No doubt, in hopes of garnering publicity, the “No Big Ships Venice Committee” has written an open letter to Ms. Loren asking her to revoke any endorsement of the ship. Thus far there has been no response from the Italian actress.

While the recent news coverage has largely focused on the arrival of a single ship, the MSC *Davina,* this is only the continuation of a much longer protest lead by  [Italia Nostra (Our Italy)](http://www.italianostra.org/?p=19140), a conservation group, over the size of cruise ships that are allowed to call in Venice.   Italia Nostra  is calling for a limit of 30,000 GT for passengers ships  in the Venice lagoon.

The growth in the Venetian cruise trade has been dramatic. Venice is one of the most popular cruise ports in Southern Europe, and it’s tied with Rome’s Civitavecchia as the busiest port in Italy. More than 600 cruise ships call each year.  As reported by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/world/europe/15venice.html),  “*In 1999, fewer than 100,000 people visited Venice as part of a cruise, while last year nearly 1.6 million did.”*  Cruise passengers this year are expected to top 1.8 million.

Taking a quick look at the ships that already call in Venice, it is clear that while the [MSC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSC_Divina) *[Davina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSC_Divina)* is the largest*,* it is not so by much.  The *[Costa Favolosa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Favolosa)* is the same size and class as the ill-fated *Costa Concordia.*  The *[Ruby Princess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Princess)* and the *[Crown Princess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Princess_\(ship\))* are also roughly the same size as the *Costa Concordia*.   The  *[Norwegian Jade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Jade)* at 93,000 GT is also a very large ship, as are the *[MSC Musica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSC_Musica)*, the *[Grandeur of the Seas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandeur_of_the_Seas)*, the *[Crystal Serenity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Serenity),* *[Splendour of the Seas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splendour_of_the_Seas)*, and the *[MSC Armonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSC_Armonia)*, all of which range from close to 60,000 to almost 80,000 GT.  Ships of this size would be banned from the lagoon under the proposal by Italia Nostra.

Venice is now faced with the challenge of managing the volume of cruise tourism while not damaging the heritage or ecology of the historic city. Clearly, not an easy balance to strike.
