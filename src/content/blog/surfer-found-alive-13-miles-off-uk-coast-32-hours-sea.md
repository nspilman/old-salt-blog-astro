Matthew Bryce, 22, was reported missing by his family when he failed to return from a surfing trip on Sunday afternoon.

As reported by the [Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/surfer-30-hours-irish-sea-board-matthew-bryce-13-miles-scottish-coast-lucky-argyll-a7712841.html): *Police Scotland and the coastguard launched a large-scale search, with rescue teams from Campbeltown, Southend, Gigha, Tarbert and Port Ellen involved.*

*The 22-year-old was eventually found by a search and rescue helicopter at around 7.30pm on Monday, drifting 13 miles from the Argyll coast. Mr Bryce, from Glasgow, was taken to Belfast Hospital for treatment for hypothermia.*

*Dawn Petrie, from the Belfast coastguard operations centre, said: “He’d been in the water for some 30 hours when the helicopter was delighted to spot him.* 

*“He was extremely lucky. He was wearing the right equipment, had a very thick neoprene wetsuit on and did the right thing by staying with his surfboard. That must have helped him to survive for so long.”*
