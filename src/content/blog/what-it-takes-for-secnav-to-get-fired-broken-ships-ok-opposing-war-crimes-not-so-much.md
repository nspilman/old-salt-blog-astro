![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rspencer2.jpg)The Secretary of the Navy, Richard V. Spencer, has been fired. What is revelatory is what he was fired for. 

As we posted last month, in January, Spencer [made a promise to President Trump](https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2019/10/16/the-navys-accountability-crisis-over-a-bet-ensnares-its-top-leader/#75a51d141098) that the advanced weapons elevators on the new carrier [USS *Gerald R. Ford*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Gerald_R._Ford) would be operational by the end of the summer or the president should fire him. The elevators are not operational and without them, as one critic has noted the most expensive warship in history is little more than a “[$13-billion nuclear-powered floating berthing barge](https://news.usni.org/2019/10/22/carrier-ford-may-not-deploy-until-2024-3rd-weapons-elevator-certified).”  Nevertheless, that was not what Secretary Spencer was fired for.

The current occupant of the Oval Office recently pardoned three officers convicted or accused of war crimes, despite [objections from the Pentagon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2019/11/15/trump-issues-pardons-war-crimes-cases-despite-pentagon-opposition-move/). One of whom was Edward Gallagher, who was acquitted of a murder charge in the stabbing death of an Islamic State militant captive, but convicted of posing with the corpse while in Iraq in 2017.

Tweeter in Chief also attacked the Navy for proceeding with disciplinary actions against Gallagher which would strip him of his SEAL Trident. Secretary Spencer replied that [he didn’t consider a tweet an order and would need a formal order](https://time.com/5738103/secretary-navy-trump-tweet/) to stop a review of a sailor who could lose his status as a Navy SEAL.

Yesterday, Secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer, was asked to resign. After suggesting that he should be fired if the USS *Gerald R. Ford* was not operational by last summer, he was fired for not supporting the pardon of a war criminal. So, for this administration, broken ships are OK, but standing against war crimes is not. 

An excerpt from Richard Spencer’s [letter of resignation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/25/richard-spencers-last-letter-navy-chief-after-seal-gallagher-case/4295123002/): 

*As Secretary of the Navy, one of the most important responsibilities I have to our people is to maintain good order and discipline throughout the ranks. I regard this as deadly serious business. The lives of our Sailors, Marines and civilian teammates quite literally depend on the professional execution our many missions, and they also depend on the ongoing faith and support of the people we serve and the allies we serve alongside.*

*The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries. Good order and discipline is what has enabled our victory against foreign tyranny time and again, from Captain Lawrence’s famous order “Don’t Give up the Ship” to the discipline and determination that propelled our flag to the highest point of Iwo Jima.*

*The Constitution, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, are the shields that set us apart, and the beacons that protect us all. Through my Title Ten Authority, I have strived to ensure our proceedings are fair, transparent and consistent, from the newest recruit to the Flag and General Officer level.*

*Unfortunately, it has become apparent that in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline. I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag and my faith to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.*
