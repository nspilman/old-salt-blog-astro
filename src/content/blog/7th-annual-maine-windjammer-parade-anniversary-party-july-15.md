*The Maine Windjammer Association will host the 7th annual Maine Windjammer Parade past the Rockland Breakwater on July 15 from 2-4pm. Geared for both spectators on shore and windjammer guests, the event will provide close-up views of the entire fleet as it sails within a stone’s throw of the Rockland Breakwater Lighthouse. Spectators may view the Parade of Sail from anywhere along the mile-long Breakwater. Immediately following the Parade, many of the windjammers will anchor next to the jetty inside Rockland Harbor for the evening. Open to the public, festivities will also include a free evening concert at Sharp’s Wharf by folksinger Gordon Bok deemed by Time Magazine the “poet laureate of those who go down to the sea in ships,” a multi-media display of historic photos of the 75-year-old company, open schooner tours and more. For more information about the Parade, call the [Maine Windjammer Association](http://www.sailmainecoast.com/) at 800-807-WIND.*
