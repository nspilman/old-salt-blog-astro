![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/ssbadger2023.jpg)The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration (MARAD) has awarded nearly [$12 million in grants to eight marine highway projects](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/newsroom/biden-harris-administration-announces-grants-support-more-efficient-supply-chains-running) across the nation under the United States Marine Highway Program (USMHP). 

One of these grants, $600,000 awarded to [Lake Michigan Carferry, Inc](https://www.ssbadgerstore.com/)., is to study the feasibility of converting the historic steamship [SS *Badger*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Badger), the last coal-fired, passenger car ferry operating on the Great Lakes, to a zero-emission ferry vessel. 

From the [MARAD press release](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/newsroom/biden-harris-administration-announces-grants-support-more-efficient-supply-chains-running): *The project will facilitate the safe, sustainable, and efficient transfer movement of three types of freight: traditional semi-trailers, oversize loads, and project cargo. The service offers customers a more economical and efficient transportation route which allows truckers to avoid a 350-mile trip through Chicago on the heavily congested I-90. As the last coal-powered freight and passenger ferry in the United States, this project will embrace clean energy and support the United States Marine Highway Program’s initiative of reducing emissions.*  

The SS *Badger* is a 410-foot-long coal-fired passenger and vehicle ferry operating in Lake Michigan on a four-hour shuttle service between Ludington, Michigan, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin. She began sailing in 1953 and to her admirers, she is a national treasure, while to her detractors, she is an environmental menace that until 2013 dumped more than 4 tons of toxic coal ash into Lake Michigan daily.  The *Badger* had been operating on an EPA waiver that allowed it to continue dumping ash. 

In 2013, the owners of the ship entered into a [consent decree with the EPA](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/04/update-epa-consent-decree-allows-ss-badger-to-keep-sailing-and-dumping-coal-ash-for-two-more-years/) to reduce the amount of ash being dumped and to end the dumping entirely by the beginning of the 2015 sailing season.
