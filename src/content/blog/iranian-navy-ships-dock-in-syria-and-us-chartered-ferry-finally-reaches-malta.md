Maria Dolores

On Tuesday, we [posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/22/iranian-navy-ships-transit-the-suez-canal-first-since-1979/) about the first northbound transit by two Iranian Navy ships through the Suez Canal since 1979.  Yesterday these ships docked in Syria on a training mission.  Thanks to Phil Leon for passing the article along.

Also in the Mediterranean, the *Maria Dolores*, a ferry chartered by the United States, carried 300 passengers, including at least 167 U.S. citizens, out of Libya, arriving in Malta today, after three days of delays.  Strong winds and high seas had delayed the ferry’s departure.
