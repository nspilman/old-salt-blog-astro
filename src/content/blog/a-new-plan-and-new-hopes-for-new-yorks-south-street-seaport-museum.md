Great news for supporters of New York’s [South Street Seaport Museum which has been in a state of near collapse](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/15/new-yorks-seaport-museum-struggles-to-stay-afloat/) since February.  The [Save our Seaport](http://saveourseaport.wordpress.com/) grassroots organization reports the following:

*The NYS Attorney General has told the Seaport Museum New York that all vessels must remain where they are. This effectively blocks the Museum’s efforts to remove them from New York Harbor. Whether they can stay at the Seaport is not known at this time. But staying in New York allows them to be looked after in a better manner.*  
  
There are also reports that certain leases held by the Museum will be sold back to the City of New York to generate enough cash to meet current obligations and get the museum back on its feet.  The existing board is reported likely to be replaced.

The announcement put out by [Save Our Seaport](http://saveourseaport.wordpress.com/) was titled, “*A Light At The End Of The Tunnel*.”  It may yet be too soon to tell if the  light is an oncoming train, but it is certainly an improvement over the darkness of the last few months.
