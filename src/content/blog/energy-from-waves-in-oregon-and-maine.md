![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/buoy.jpg)Two projects are underway in Maine and Oregon to produce energy from ocean waves.   [Ocean Renewable Power Company](http://www.oceanrenewablepower.com/home.htm), in Maine, is using horizontal turbines to capture the energy of ebbing and flooding tides.  Initial tests have met or exceeded their targets and the company hopes to install a commercial version of the the test turbines now in place and be hooked in to the Bangor Hydro Electric Company grid as soon as 2011.

On the West coast, [Ocean Power Technologies](http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/index.htm) is  navigating the regulatory maze to be allowed to test offshore buoys to capture and convert wave energy into electricity.  They recently concluded a Settlement Agreement with 11 state and federal agencies for a utility-scale wave power project in Oregon.  [One source](http://www.riskcenter.com/story.php?id=20361) is reporting that they have also received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

*The deal will allow the deployment of ten PowerBuoy devices. PowerBuoys move up and down with waves – allowing a power take-off to drive an electric generator. The electricity is transmitted to land by an underwater cable.*

*When complete, the 1.5 megawatt capacity wave station should produce enough energy to power a thousand homes. The company is already manufacturing the first 150 kilowatt PB150 PowerBuoy at the Oregon Iron Works.*
