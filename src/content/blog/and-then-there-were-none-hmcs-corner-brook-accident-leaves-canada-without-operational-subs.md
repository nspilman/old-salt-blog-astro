![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/300px-HMCS_Corner_Brook.jpg)Canada’s hunter killer submarine, [HMCS *Corner Brook*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMCS_Corner_Brook_\(SSK_878\)), limped back to base last weekend after running aground during a  training exercise in the waters of Nootka Sound off the central east coast of Vancouver Island.  The accident leaves Canada without an operational submarine.  Canada’s other three are also out of service.  Oops.

[Accident leaves Canada without operational submarines](http://www.bclocalnews.com/news/123251693.html)  
  
*The accident means all four of Canada’s subs are not in any shape to sail: HMCS Victoria is back in the water but is undergoing extensive testing, HMCS Windsor is undergoing repair and maintenance in Halifax, and HMCS Chicoutimi, which suffered a fatal fire in 2004, is at Victoria Shipyards.*

*Officers on board the HMCS Corner Brook, which was alone deep in the waters of Nootka Sound off the central east coast of Vancouver Island, were being put through their paces during advanced submarine officer training.*

*The 12-day exercise, scheduled to wrap up Friday, abruptly ended around noon last Saturday following the grounding.*
