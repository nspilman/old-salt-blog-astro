![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/04/shantymen.jpg)Yesterday, we posted about a [virtual chantey sing this Sunday, organized by New York’s South Street Seaport Museum.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/04/virtual-shanty-chantey-sing-part-1-south-street-seaport/) Here is a slightly different take on a virtual shanty sing.

The [Sheringham Shantymen](https://www.shantymen.com/) are celebrating their 30th anniversary and they are inviting everyone to join in an on-line singalong. The group has recorded their version of the shanty, “Drunken Sailor” and invites you to sing with them.  Here’s how it works:

Go to [Sheringham Shantymen – Drunken Sailor](https://youtu.be/vE1aRv5N_t4) to see the Shantymen’s song. Record yourself or your family singing along, actions and all. Then upload your video at [Shantymen.wetransfer.com](https://shantymen.wetransfer.com/). The final version will be shared on the [Shantymen’s website](https://www.shantymen.com/) and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Sheringhamshantymen/).

The group was formed by volunteers from RNLI Sheringham Lifeboat Station and has been a major fundraiser for the charity over that time. In 2007 it raised £20,000 for the purchase of an inshore lifeboat for RNLI Wicklow in Ireland. The Sheringham Shantymen was on service for 10 years, rescuing 96 people in that time. It is the only organization outside the RNLI allowed to displaying the RNLI insignia on its badge.
