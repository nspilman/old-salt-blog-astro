![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/megacoral.jpg)On the chart, it was marked as a shipwreck in the Pacific Ocean near the Solomon Islands, but when scientists and filmmakers from the [National Geographic Society’s Pristine Seas](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/world-largest-coral-colony-discovery) took a closer look, they were shocked to find the world’s largest-ever recorded coral. The mega coral is a collection of many tiny connected creatures that together form one organism rather than a coral reef.

As reported by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/articles/c4gp4g4e5q8o), the coral measures 34m wide, 32m long and 5.5m high – which is bigger than a blue whale. The coral is estimated to be at 300-years-old.

The coral was found in deeper waters than some coral reefs which scientists think might be why it is in good health.

Eric Brown, a coral scientist on the National Geographic research trip, said:

“While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope.”

The large coral is a species called [Pavona clavus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavona_clavus) and is home to shrimp, crabs, fish and other marine creatures.
