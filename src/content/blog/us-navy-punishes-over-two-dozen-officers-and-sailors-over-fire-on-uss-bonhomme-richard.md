![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/firebhr.jpg)In July 2020 an [explosion and fire broke out](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/07/fire-rages-on-amphibious-assault-ship-uss-bonhomme-richard-close-to-60-injured/) aboard the amphibious assault ship [USS *Bonhomme Richard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bonhomme_Richard_\(LHD-6\)) dockside at the Naval Base San Diego. The fire would burn for four days, injuring 60 firefighters and ultimately resulting in the total loss of the ship, which was towed to a scrap yard in April 2021.  

Last Friday, the [US Navy announced punishments for more than 20 officers and enlisted personnel](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/18/us/navy-bonhomme-richard-fire-punishment.html) for their actions and inaction in connection to the fire. The fire itself is believed to have been started by [an act of arson](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/07/navy-charges-sailor-with-arson-in-fire-that-destroyed-uss-bonhomme-richard/). Navy Seaman Apprentice Ryan Sawyer Mays was charged with arson in the disaster. He faces a hearing on Aug. 17, with his trial expected to run Sept. 19 through Sept. 30.

Although Seaman Mays was accused of deliberately starting the fire, the findings of an i[nvestigation released by the Navy in October 2021](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/10/uss-bonhomme-richards-destruction-by-fire-completely-preventable-navy-finds/) revealed that the damage could have been lessened had naval officers been better prepared. “The ship was lost due to an inability to extinguish the fire,” the report said.

Along with a [letter of censure to retired Vice Adm. Richard Brown](https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/navy-punishes-two-dozen-officers-sailors-in-uss-bonhomme-fire/509-11a6f4be-43e9-49da-b0ac-f67a2fb42c4b), who was commander of Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet at the time of the July 12, 2020, fire, the Navy says it has issued 27 “individual disposition decisions” regarding fire prevention, readiness and response efforts aboard the ship.

The actions ordered by U.S. Pacific Fleet commander Adm. Samuel Paparo include letters of reprimand and forfeitures of pay for the former commander of the *Bonhomme Richard* Capt. Gregory Thoroman and executive officer Capt. Michael Ray, as well as a punitive letter of reprimand for the ship’s Command Master Chief Jose Hernandez, according to a statement from the service provided to [USNI News](https://news.usni.org/2022/07/15/navy-announces-punishments-for-bonhomme-richard-fire-secnav-censures-former-swo-boss).

Paparo served as the consolidated decision authority to oversee accountability actions following the completion of former 3rd Fleet commander Vice Adm. Scott Conn’s command investigation into the fire, which was released in October. He determined the punishments in a series of admiral’s masts December through January, a Navy official told [USNI News](https://news.usni.org/2022/07/15/navy-announces-punishments-for-bonhomme-richard-fire-secnav-censures-former-swo-boss).
