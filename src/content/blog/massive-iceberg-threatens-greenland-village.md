![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iceberggreenland.jpg)A 300 foot high, 11-million-ton iceberg is threatening the tiny Greenland village of Innaarsuit. The massive iceberg has grounded just off the coast. The concern is that if the iceberg should calve, the plunging ice could create a tsunami-like wave that could inundate the village of 170. Those living closest to shore have been evacuated to higher ground. The village’s power station and fuel tanks, however, are also located close to the shore.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/14/huge-iceberg-threatens-village-in-greenland) quotes William Colgan, a Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland researcher — “Iceberg production in Greenland has been increasing in the past 100 years as climate change has become stronger,” he said, while the rising number of icebergs were in turn “increasing the tsunami hazards”.

Last year, four people died and 11 were injured after a landslide caused a tsunami off another island settlement called Nuugaatsiaq, sending several houses crashing into the sea.
