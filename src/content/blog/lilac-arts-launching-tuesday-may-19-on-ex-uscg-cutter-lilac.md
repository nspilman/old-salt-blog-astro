If you are near New York harbor tomorrow be sure to stop by from 6 — 9 PM, for a reception to launch the [LILAC Art Series](http://www.lilacarts.org/) on the historic [ex-Coast Guard Cutter *Lilac*](http://www.lilacpreservationproject.org/).  The [LILAC Art Series](http://www.lilacarts.org/) is a three month art exhibition by 25 artists with a focus on three themes inspired by the ship’s story – “Steam”, “Work + Labor” and “Restoration/Reinvention.”  Open free to the public. Regular hours on the Cutter *Lilac* resume on May 23, 2015. Also, stop by on Memorial Day for birthday cake celebrating LILAC’s 82nd year!

The [Lilac Preservation Project](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/home.html) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to restore the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Lilac as a unique vehicle for maritime education and community activities. The *Lilac* is a 1933 lighthouse tender that once carried supplies to lighthouses and maintained buoys for the U.S. Lighthouse Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Decommissioned in 1972, the *Lilac* is now a historic museum ship berthed at Hudson River Park’s Pier 25 in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City. The *Lilac* regularly hosts free exhibitions, tours and educational programs. For more information, visit [www.lilacpreservationproject.org.](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/home.html)
