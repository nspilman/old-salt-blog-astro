*Australian adventurer and solo round the world sailor, Don McIntyre announced today that [Mike Perham, the world’s youngest solo circumnavigator](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/08/27/new-record-set-for-youngest-sailor-to-circumnavigate-more-challenges-announced/), has signed up as Second-in-command for the 2010 Bounty Boat Expedition. This is a 4,000-mile re-enactment 221 years after Capt William Bligh and his supporting crew were forced into an open-boat by the mutineering crew on HMS Bounty and successfully sailed from Tonga to Timor in the Pacific.*

*McIntyre and Perham will face the same deprivations, with little food, no charts or toilet paper and only the limited navigation implements that were available to Bligh.*

*The search is now on for two extra crew to join this expedition, which has a serious scientific purpose, as well as raise money for MND research. This opportunity of a lifetime to re-create history will cost each individual £10,000 to participate. Only those with an extreme sense of adventure need apply.*
