![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/08/O2tideturbine.jpg)These days, most of the turbines producing clean energy are powered by the wind. Last month, a turbine powered by the tides, described as “the world’s most powerful” began grid-connected power generation at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney, an archipelago located north of mainland Scotland.

[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/worlds-most-powerful-tidal-turbine-starts-to-export-power-to-grid-.html) reports that in an announcement, Scottish engineering firm [Orbital Marine Power](https://orbitalmarine.com/) explained how its 2-megawatt O2 turbine had been anchored in a body of water called the Fall of Warness**,** with a subsea cable linking it to a local electricity network on land.

The floating platform is moored via anchors in the powerful tidal stream. Underwater rotors capture the dense flowing energy. 

It’s expected that the turbine, which is 74 meters long, will “operate in the waters off Orkney for the next 15 years,” the company said, and have “the capacity to meet the annual electricity demand of around 2,000 UK homes.”

The turbine is also set to send power to a land-based electrolyzer that will generate so-called green hydrogen. In a statement, Orbital Marine Power’s CEO, Andrew Scott, described Wednesday’s news as “a major milestone for the O2.”

Michael Matheson, the Scottish government’s Cabinet secretary for net zero, energy and transport, said his country was “ideally-placed to harness the enormous global market for marine energy.”

“The deployment of Orbital Marine Power’s O2, the world’s most powerful tidal turbine, is a proud moment for Scotland and a significant milestone in our journey to net zero,” he went on to add.
