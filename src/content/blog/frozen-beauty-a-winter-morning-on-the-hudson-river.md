It is currently around 18 degrees F on the west bank of the Hudson River, but with the wind chill the figures are somewhere in the negative numbers. It seems appropriate, therefore, to post this wonderful video, shot by an [X-Factor Aerial](http://xfactoraerial.com/) drone. The footage is from about 50 miles north of New York City and features some great views of the ruins of Bannerman’s Castle on Pollepel Island. The “castle” was once a military surplus warehouse. The video also have great shots a Coast Guard cutter on the ice choked river.
