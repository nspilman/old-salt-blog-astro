*[HMS Ocean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Ocean_\(L12\))*, a  Royal Navy amphibious assault ship, had planned for a seven week deployment but was diverted to Libya and  ended up being away for 225 days with 176 at sea. When they received word that they would be back in time for Christmas, they made this video of a Mariah Carey song.
