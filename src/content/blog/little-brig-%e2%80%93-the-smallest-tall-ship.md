![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/03/carolineallen2big.jpg)The Isle of Wight based charity, the [Little Brig Sailing Trust](http://www.littlebrig.com/about.html), now has the bragging rights of owning a fleet of the world’s smallest tall ships.   (Actually they have only two ships, so perhaps they could also claim the smallest fleet of the smallest tall ships.)

The two 9 meter brigs, the *Bob Allen* and the *Caroline Allen,* are designed to introduce sailors as young as ten to the fun and challenges of sailing a square rigged “tall ship.”   The small tall-ships cost less to build, operate and crew than larger vessels. They are also incredibly cute.   The brigs were designed by British naval architect Colin Mudie.   Thanks to Tom Russell of the [Tall Ship & Traditional Sail Professionals Linked-In group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2041742) for pointing it out.
