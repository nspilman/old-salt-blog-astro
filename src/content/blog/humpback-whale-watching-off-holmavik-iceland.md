We have just gotten back from a week-long voyage along the west coast of Iceland from Akureyri to Reykjavik on the three-masted motor sailor *Panorama*. One of the stops was the village of Hólmavík, population 300. The village may be best known by tourists for its [Museum of Sorcery & Witchcraft](http://www.galdrasyning.is/index.php?lang=en), an interesting if a rather small museum, which also features a cafe, a gift shop and tourist information center. Hólmavík was the center of witchcraft and witch-hunting in 17th century Iceland.

The village should perhaps also be better known for the whales in the fjord. Whereas some whale watching sites have as many as twenty boats offering tours, Hólmavík has exactly one. We were fortunate enough to be able to catch one of the last tours of the season offered by [Laki Tours](https://lakitours.com/our-tours/whale-watching-holmavik-2/). The morning was cold and the wind bitter but, we saw lots of humpback whales, feeding in the Steingrimsfjordur Fjord. Captain Víðir was skilled in finding the whales and our naturalist/guide Judith was knowledgeable and entertaining. Here is a short video.
