![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/11/queenhind.jpg)The livestock carrier, [*Queen Hind*](http://www.vesseltracking.net/ship/queen-hind-7920675), carrying 14,600 sheep, [capsized on Sunday after leaving the Black Sea port of Midia](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50538592?fbclid=IwAR1Z1chesS6nLgY2SH4K1NvjTJtC8kWCMGDQGKNOrLN60N5AcbuygYI1Mpo), near the south-eastern Romanian city of Constanta. The crew escaped safely. It is unclear how many of the sheep aboard were killed. As of Sunday, 32 sheep were reported to be rescued, with thousands believed still trapped inside the hull.

The ship, which left Midia at about 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT), was heading to the Saudi port of Jeddah with its cargo.

The ship, flying the flag of Palau, is a converted car carrier built-in 1980. Based on the IMO identification number, [the ship was originally *Sea Coquette*](https://www.balticshipping.com/vessel/imo/7920675) and later operated as *Nanima*, *Nagasaki Maru* and *Asaka Maru*.

While the cause of the accident is not currently known, both livestock carriers and car carriers have a record of issues with stability. In September, the [car carrier *Golden Ray* capsized](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/10/why-did-golden-ray-cargo-ship-capsize-possibilities/2272699001/) shortly after departing Brunswick, Georgia. 

Last year in December, the livestock carrier [MV *Jawan* came close to capsizing](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/amsa-revokes-certificate-for-unstable-livestock-carrier) in Portland, in Victoria, Australia. The ship developed a rolling motion suggesting that the ship was unstable. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) subsequently revoked the Australian Certificate for the Carriage of Livestock (ACCL) for the ship because the approved stability data could not be relied upon when the vessel was loaded.

In 2015, the [livestock carrier](https://shipwrecklog.com/log/tag/livestock-carrier/) *Haidar,* loaded with 5,000 cattle, capsized while berthed at Barcarena, Para, Brazil. 

The most tragic livestock carrier casualty was the [*Danny F II,* which capsized and sank off Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Danny_F_II) in 2009. Like *Queen Hind*, *Danny F II* was also a converted car carrier. Of the 83 people aboard, 44 were lost.  10,224 sheep and 17,932 cattle also died when the ship sank.
