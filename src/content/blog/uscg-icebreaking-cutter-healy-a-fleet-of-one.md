USCGC Healy - the US Icebreaker Fleet

The United States has something like eleven aircraft carriers, fifty nine destroyers, thirty frigates, seventy nine submarines, thirty amphibious assault ships as well as numerous minesweepers patrol craft and supply ships.  The navy’s battle fleet tonnage is greater than that of the next 13 largest navies combined.   Quite a few ships.  In a perfect world we would never use any of them, though we are obviously far from a perfect world.

So how many operational icebreakers does the US have? We have an Arctic coast, after all.  As events of the last week or two have shown, we have a need for ice breaking.   The answer is –  one. The US has only one medium icebreaker – the [USCG *Healy*](http://www.uscg.mil/pacarea/cgchealy/).  The Coast Guard has two other aging heavy icebreakers, the *Polar Sea* and the *[Polar Star](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Polar_Star)*, but neither are in service. The *[Polar Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Polar_Sea)* broke down in 2010 and the Coast Guard has decommissioned her, while the *Polar Star* is being refit and may be available by 2013.

AS an update on the mission to provide emergency fuel to icebound Nome, Alaska, in which the USCG Cutter Healy escorted the Russian tanker through the ice, the transfer of fuel is expected to start today. It is unclear how long the transfer will take.  For safety, the transfer will only take place during the daylight which in Nome is currently 5 hours per day.
