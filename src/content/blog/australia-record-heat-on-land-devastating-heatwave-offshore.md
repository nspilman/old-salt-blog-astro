![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/12/aussiehotwater.jpg)The temperatures in Australia have been hotter than ever recorded in history. Wildfires are raging, filling the air of several cities, including Sydney, with acrid smoke.  Drought is choking a significant portion of the country.

As bad as things are on land, they are just as bad offshore where Western Australia’s coastline is in the midst of the [most widespread marine heatwave](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-18/marine-heatwave-kills-fish-as-australia-faces-record-temperature/11808268) it has experienced since reliable satellite monitoring began in 1993. The heat is killing fish, shellfish, crabs, and kelp. 

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/world/climate-environment/climate-change-tasmania/) reports that over recent decades, the rate of ocean warming off Tasmania, Australia’s southernmost state and a gateway to the South Pole, has climbed to nearly four times the global average, oceanographers say.

More than 95 percent of the giant kelp — a living high-rise of 30-foot stalks that served as a habitat for some of the rarest marine creatures in the world — died.

Giant kelp had stretched the length of Tasmania’s rocky east coast throughout recorded history. Now it clings to a tiny patch near Southport, the island’s southern tip, where the water is colder.

We recently posted about the [return of the Blob](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/12/the-blob-shuts-down-the-alaskan-cod-season/), a large patch of unusually warm water off Alaska and the Pacific Northwest that has had a devastating impact on cod and other fish. Climate change appears to increasingly make unusually hot ocean waters more the rule than the exception.
