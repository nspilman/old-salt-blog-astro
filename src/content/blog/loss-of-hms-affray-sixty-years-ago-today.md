*HMS Affray set off on 16 April 1951 for a training exercise in the English Channel, but got into difficulty and all 75 people on board died.*

*A poppy wreath is due to be placed out to sea on the exact spot where the wreck was found on 17 April.   A plaque, engraved with the crew’s names, may also be put up in Alderney.*
