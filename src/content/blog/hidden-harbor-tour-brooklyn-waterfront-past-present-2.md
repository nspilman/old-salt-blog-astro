On June 7th, [The Working Harbor Committee (WHC)](http://workingharbor.org/) is sponsoring a Hidden Harbour Tour® — Brooklyn Waterfront Past & Present — featuring guest speakers Capt. Maggie Flanagan, WHC & Waterfront Alliance, and Bill Miller, renowned maritime historian & author, [www.billmilleratsea.com](http://www.billmilleratsea.com/). From the WHC announcement:

**Join Working Harbor Committee for a tour of Brooklyn waterfront industry, past and present.**  From Newtown Creek through Sunset Park, the 8 miles of Brooklyn shore facing the Harbor’s Upper Bay were once filled with manufacturing, shipping, and commerce. Though apartment towers and landscaped parks now capture attention, Brooklyn still retains active trade and maritime business.

Highlights include Brooklyn Navy Yard, the city’s new waterfront recycling facility at Gowanus Bay, and the working rail-to-barge connection at Brooklyn Army Terminal.

The fully narrated boat tour departs at 6:15pm sharp. Check-in begins at 5:45 pm from NY Waterway Pier 79 located at W. 39th St. & 12th Ave in Manhattan. Snack bar on board. [Tickets: $35; $30 seniors.](https://www.nycharities.org/Events/EventLevels.aspx?etid=10539) For group sale rates, email: workingharbor@aol.com

The mission of the Working Harbor Committee is to strengthen awareness of the working harbor’s history and vitality today, and its opportunities for the future. WHC produces maritime educational programs and boat tours, as well as community events such as the annual Great North River Tugboat Race.
