![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/06/balticmfalcon1.jpg)This story just keeps getting stranger.  A year ago last June, the Swedish treasure hunters, [Ocean X Team](http://www.oceanexplorer.se/), saw something that they did not understand while doing sonar sweeps of the bottom of the Baltic Sea.   There appeared to be a 200′ diameter disk on the bottom, which the press dubbed the “Millenium Falcon” as it resembled the Star Wars space craft.  This June, [the Ocean X Team dove on the site](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/18/dive-on-baltic-sea-millenium-falcon-only-deepens-mystery/) and the mystery only deepened.  The object on the bottom appeared to be a dome described as “mushroom shaped.”

Now, a former Swedish naval officer and WWII expert Anders Autellus is suggesting that the structure – measuring 200ft by 25ft – could be the base of a top-secret Nazi device designed to block British and Russian submarine movements in the area during World War II.

[Sonar scans show that ‘UFO’ at bottom of Baltic sea may actually be a top-secret Nazi anti-submarine defence lost since the Second World War](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2172503/Sonar-scans-UFO-Baltic-sea-actually-secret-Nazi-super-weapon-lost-World-War-II.html)

*Divers exploring a ‘UFO-shaped’ object in the Baltic sea say that the strange, curved object might be a Nazi device lost beneath the waves since the end of the Second World War.*

*Sonar scans have shown that the device, raised 10ft above the seabed and measuring 200ft by 25ft, could be the base of an anti-submarine weapon.*

*The weapon was built with wire mesh which could have baffled submarine radar, leading enemy craft to crash – much in the same way as turning out a lighthouse could be used as a weapon against shipping.*

*But now former Swedish naval officer and WWII expert Anders Autellus has revealed that the structure – measuring 200ft by 25ft – could be the base of a device designed to block British and Russian submarine movements in the area.*

*The huge steel-and-concrete structure could be one of the most important historical finds in years.*

*Autellus claims it would have been built of double-skinned concrete and reinforced with wire mesh to baffle radar – which could explain why the dive team’s equipment repeatedly failed near the mystery object.*

*‘The area was vital to the German war machine because most of the ball bearings for its tanks and trucks came from here. Without them the German army would have ground to a halt,’ explained one expert.*

*‘This device dwarfs anything ever found before and is an important weapons discovery,’ they added.*

*Explorer Stefan Hogeborn – who is studying the images for the Ocean X diving team – agreed: ‘It is a good candidate for the answer to this mystery. The object lies directly underneath a shipping route.’*
