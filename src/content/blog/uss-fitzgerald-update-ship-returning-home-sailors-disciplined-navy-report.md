![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/08/fitz2.jpg)The [USS *Fitzgerald*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fitzgerald) seriously damaged in a collision with a container ship on June 17th that killed seven U.S. sailors, will be transported back to the United States for repairs. The destroyer will be carried via heavy lift ship between mid-September and the end of October, Cmdr. Clay Doss, a 7th Fleet spokesman, told [Stars and Stripes](https://www.stripes.com/news/uss-fitzgerald-will-be-transported-stateside-for-repairs-this-fall-1.482900). 

The [BBC reports](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40970860) that the US Navy has announced that about a dozen sailors are to be disciplined on the USS Fitzgerald due to the collision. The deputy chief of naval operations, Admiral Bill Moran, said the commanding officer and two other senior crew would no longer serve aboard the ship.

The [US Navy also released a report](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/17/world/asia/document-navy-report-on-uss-fitzgerald.html) focused on the aftermath of the collision. The report commended the ship’s sailor’s response to the flooding and their attempts to rescue fellow sailors. The report says in part,  “The Sailors assigned to Berthing 2 should be commended for their response to the dangerous and deadly threat they faced.” It goes on to note: “Through their swift, and in many cases heroic actions, members of the FITZGERALD crew saved lives. No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding in the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation.”
