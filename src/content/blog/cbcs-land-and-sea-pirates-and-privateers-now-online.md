![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LS_PrivatesandPrivateers.jpg)We [posted previously](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/03/03/pirates-and-privateers/) about “[Pirates and Privateers](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/2012/03/pirates-and-privateers.html),” a documentary on [CBC’s Land and Sea](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/).  The 20 minute documentary is now available on-line. It presents a distinctive view of piracy and privateering from the perspective of the Canadian Maritimes, not often seen by those of us to the South. Well worth the time to watch.
