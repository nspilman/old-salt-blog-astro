![elissa](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/elissa1-150x197.jpg)The three masted iron barque *[Elissa](http://www.galvestonhistory.org/1877_Tall_Ship_Elissa.asp),* built in 1877, will be returning to her pier this Saturday at the [Texas Seaport Museum](http://www.galvestonhistory.org/texas_seaport_museum.asp) in Galveston after completing a $3 million repair and replacement of hull plating.  Congratulations to Jamie White and all the staff, partners and volunteers who tirelessly raised funds and worked to bring the ship back from near disaster.   As [we posted in August of 2011](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/08/the-tall-ship-elissa-stray-current-electrolytic-corrosion/), the *Elissa* was a a victim of stray current electrolysis due to electrical cables breaking and falling into the water during Hurricane Ike in September 2008. The damage was found at the next drydocking when it was discovered that 16% of the hull plating had suffered from the electrolytic corrosion.  After a period of [intensive planning and fundraising](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/tall-ship-elissa-fundraising-on-track-not-so-endangered-after-all/), the grand old ship was put on dock four and a half months ago at Bollinger Shipyard.  With new and repaired plating, the *Elissa* is expected to arrive back at her berth around 1PM and will be open to the public from 3 – 5PM.
