![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/09/cruise-shipsdorian.jpg)Late last week, the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/covid-4/coronavirus-cruise-ship) raised its [COVID-19 travel health notice level for cruise ships to its highest warning level](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-says-avoid-cruise-travel-covid-19-cases-surge-2021-12-30/) and said people should avoid traveling on cruise ships regardless of their vaccination status, as daily COVID-19 cases in the country climb to record highs due to the fast-spreading Omicron variant.

The health agency has or is investigating COVID-19 cases on more than 90 ships. It starts an investigation if 0.10% or more passengers on guest voyages test positive for COVID-19.

[CLIA, the Cruise Lines International Association, responded](https://www.marinelog.com/passenger/cruiseships/clia-calls-new-cdc-cruise-warning-perplexing/?utm_source=&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=30243):

The decision by the CDC to raise the travel level for cruise is particularly perplexing considering that cases identified on cruise ships consistently make up a very slim minority of the total population onboard—far fewer than on land—and the majority of those cases are asymptomatic or mild in nature, posing little to no burden on medical resources onboard or onshore. No setting can be immune from this virus—however, it is also the case that cruise provides one of the highest levels of demonstrated mitigation against the virus. Cruise ships offer a highly controlled environment with science-backed measures, known testing and vaccination levels far above other venues or modes of transportation and travel, and significantly lower incidence rates than land.

The CLIA went on to note that COVID-19 infection rates on cruise ships are 33 percent lower than occurring currently onshore and that vaccination rates onboard cruise ships typically are upwards of 95 percent—significantly higher than the overall U.S. population which is hovering at 62 percent.
