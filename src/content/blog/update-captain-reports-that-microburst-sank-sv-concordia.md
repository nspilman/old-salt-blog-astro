Cross-sectional drawing of a Microburst

Captain William Curry of the *SV Concordia* is reporting that the school ship was struck by a [microburst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microburst), also referred to a [white squall](http://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/basics/whitesquall.htm), which knocked down the 188′ three masted schooner,  rolling the ship 90 degrees. She sank in twenty minutes.  Microbursts are capable of generating wind speeds higher than 75 m/s (168 mph; 270 km/h).  All aboard made it to the lifeboats and were rescued.

The captain also reported that the ship capsized on Wednesday rather than Thursday as had been previously reported.

The schooner *[Pride of Baltimore](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3263003)* in 1986 and the school ship [](http://books.google.com/books?id=XHROKNJvz9cC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=wind+microburst+pride+of+baltimore&source=bl&ots=Z4oswS7-HK&sig=WAkzwP2fq_TcrBormVMRlM26Wlc&hl=en&ei=FV2BS6e-CM-WtgfqzeXOBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=wind%20microburst%20pride%20of%20baltimore&f=false)*[Albatross](http://books.google.com/books?id=XHROKNJvz9cC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=wind+microburst+pride+of+baltimore&source=bl&ots=Z4oswS7-HK&sig=WAkzwP2fq_TcrBormVMRlM26Wlc&hl=en&ei=FV2BS6e-CM-WtgfqzeXOBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=wind%20microburst%20pride%20of%20baltimore&f=false)* in 1961 are both believed to have been capsized by microbursts or “white squalls.”  Microbursts also cause “wind shear” which has been blamed for the crashes of several commercial air liners.
