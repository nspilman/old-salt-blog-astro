![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/04/evergivenstuck.jpg)[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-suezcanal-ship/ever-givens-suez-canal-detention-order-lifted-says-lawyer-idUSKCN2EC15C) is reporting that an Egyptian court has lifted the detention order on the [*Ever Given*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:5630138/mmsi:353136000/imo:9811000/vessel:EVER_GIVEN) container ship, allowing its expected release from the Suez Canal on Wednesday, according to a lawyer and judicial sources.

The *Ever Given*’s owners and insurers announced on Sunday that they had reached a settlement with the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) over compensation for the ship becoming grounded in March and blocking traffic in the waterway. The [amount of the settlement](https://www.ship-technology.com/news/sca-reaches-settlement/) has not been announced. The SCA initially demanded $916m in compensation to cover salvage efforts, reputational damage, and lost revenue. The demand was later lowered to $550 million. 

The ship has been held under court order in the Great Bitter Lake between two stretches of the canal since it was [dislodged on March 29](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/03/ever-given-in-the-suez-canal-free-at-last/). The 1,312-foot-long ship blocked the Suez Canal for six days, from March 23 to 29.

In its departure from the canal, the *Ever Given* will be accompanied by two tugs and two senior canal guides, Suez Canal sources said.

The [value of the goods inside the *Ever Given*‘s 18,000 containers](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57719551) has been estimated at $775m.
