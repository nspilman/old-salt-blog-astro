![Caribbean_Princess](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Caribbean_Princess.jpg)Princess Cruises announced that the [*Caribbean Princess*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Princess) would be returning to Houston one day early “*because we were informed that dense fog is expected to close the port for much of the weekend*.” Others have suggested that it was because of a [norovirus-like gastrointestinal illness](http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/surv/outbreak/2014/january25_caribbean_princess.htm) that had sickened 165 passengers and 11 crew members aboard the ship. Personnel from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) will be boarding the ship today to make inspections. The outbreak on the *Caribbean Princess,* sickened slightly over 5% of the passengers. On the [*Explorer of the Seas,* which also returned this week from a cruise shorted by an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/01/rccls-explorer-of-the-seas-sets-new-record-for-contagion-with-almost-700-ill/), more than [20%, or almost 700 of the passengers](http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/surv/outbreak/2014/january21_explorer_seas.htm) became sick.  Princess Cruises is owned by Carnival Corp.
