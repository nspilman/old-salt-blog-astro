![tugrace2009](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/09/tugrace2009.jpg)[Tropical Storm Hermine, which looked very nasty](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hermine-creates-dangerous-rip-currents-storm-surges-new-jersey-to-massachusetts/) there for a while, drifted enough to the east to miss New York harbor. There were local reports of flooding at high tide, but overall, it has been a beautiful Labor Day weekend on the banks of the Hudson River. Prudently, one Labor Day tradition was postponed. [The 24th Annual Great North River Tugboat Race and Competition which was to be held on Labor Day has been postponed](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/09/24th-annual-great-north-river-tugboat-race-competition-postponed-hermine/) to Sunday, October 9th, 2016. Given the forecasts for Hermine in the days prior to Labor Day, it would have been crazy not to postpone the race.

For those who miss the look of tugs with a bone in their teeth and roar of diesel engines on the river, here is a video of the 17th Annual Great North River Tugboat Race from 2009.
