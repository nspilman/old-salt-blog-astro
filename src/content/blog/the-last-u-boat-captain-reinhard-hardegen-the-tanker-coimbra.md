I recently saw two stories in the press that happen to overlap.

The first story was the report of the death of [Reinhard Hardegen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Hardegen) at 105 years old. Hardegen was believed to have been the last surviving German U-boat commander from World War II. He also ranked among [the most successful U-boat captains of the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_successful_U-boat_commanders), sinking 22 merchant ships with a capacity of 115,656 GRT, over five patrols.  

Two of [Korvettenkapitän Hardegen](https://uboat.net/men/hardegen.htm)‘s patrols were on the East Coast of the United States as part of [Operation Drumbeat](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/operation-drumbeat-u-boat-happy-days-x.html). With US and Canadian patrol ships diverted to protect British shipping, five German U-boats attacked shipping along the North American East Coast from Newfoundland to the Caribbean. In less than seven months, U-boat attacks destroyed 22 percent of the tanker fleet and sank 233 ships in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. The U-boats killed 5,000 seamen and passengers, more than twice the number of people who perished at Pearl Harbor. On Hardegen’s two patrols in command of U-123 during Operation Drumbeat, he sank eighteen ships totaling over 100,000 GRT. 

After the war, Reinhard Hardegen built a successful oil trading company and was elected to the Bremen city council for 32 years.

**British Oil Tanker *Coimbra***

![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/coimbra.jpg)The second news item which caught my eye was about a possible oil leak from the wreckage of a British oil tanker [*Coimbra*](https://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/1251.htm), which was sunk 76 years ago off Long Island. A [Coast Guard team will be diving on the wreckage](https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Tanker-sunk-by-U-boat-off-L-I-could-be-leaking-12990379.php) of the tanker next week to assess the environmental risk of leaking oil.

The [steam tanker *Coimbra*](https://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/1251.htm), carrying 8,038 tons of lubricating oil, was hit by one torpedo on Jan. 15, 1942.  It had left Bayonne, N.J. a day before, and was bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Of the 46 crew on board, only 10 survived. J.P. Bernard, the tanker’s captain, went down with the ship.

The *Coimbra* was sunk by U-123 under the command of Reinhard Hardegen.

As Faulkner noted, “The past isn’t dead.  It isn’t even past.”
