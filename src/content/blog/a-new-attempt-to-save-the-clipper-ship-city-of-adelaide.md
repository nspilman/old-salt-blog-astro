*When the City of Adelaide docked in Australia in 1865, her cargo of Scots migrants was welcomed with fireworks and open arms. Now, a century and a half later, she lies derelict and forgotten in Irvine, threatened with demolition in the face of dwindling funds.*

*This sorry situation could be about to change, however, through the last-minute intervention of a group of Australians, determined to salvage the historic clipper – formerly known as the HMS Carrick – for their own national good.   The Government-backed delegation is to meet Culture Minister Fiona Hyslop today for talks they say could secure the vessel’s future as a museum in the city that bears its name.*

*Peter Roberts and Tom Chapman, directors of the firm Clipper Ship City of Adelaide, are in the UK for a two-week round of negotiations that could provide a breakthrough in the long-running funding dispute surrounding the ship.*
