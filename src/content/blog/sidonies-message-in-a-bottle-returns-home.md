More than a decade ago, Sidonie Fery, a ten year old girl living in Manhattan, threw a message in a bottle into Long Island Sound. The message was a line from her favorite move – “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure,” which read ” “Be excellent to yourself, Dude!”  It also included the girl’s family phone number. In April 2010, Sidonie died tragically in a fall in Switzerland.  In December of last year, the bottle was found by a group cleaning up debris left by Hurricane Sandy. The bottle was recently returned to Sidonie’s mother, Mimi Fery.

This Saturday, a plaque was placed on a rock near the bridge at Patchogue Long Island Beach Club, where the bottle was discovered.

*The bottle only traveled a mile or two westward from where it was likely deposited to the location where parks workers found it. It was intermingled with broken docks, boating gear and a spectrum of sea trash.*

*But because the note included the girl’s New York City phone number, what otherwise would have been a worthless piece of trash became a priceless memento. Workers in Patchogue, about 60 miles east of Manhattan, called the number and returned the bottle to her mother, Mimi Fery.*

 *Fery said she sobbed when she heard workers had found the bottle and was grateful to them.*

*“It’s unbelievable,” she said Saturday of the commemoration. “The town is amazing, my daughter was a lovely and lively person and very fun, she would do fun things. She always brought joy to everybody no matter how she felt.”*
