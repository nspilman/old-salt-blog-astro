![PhilippinesChinaReefBoat](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/04/PhilippinesChinaReefBoat.jpg)You can’t make this stuff up. Only a week after the last wreckage of the minesweeper *USS Guardian* was removed from the reef in the Philippines’  Tubbataha National Marine Park, a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site, where it [ran hard aground on January 17th](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/01/minesweeper-uss-guardian-runs-aground-on-reef-in-philippines-tubbataha-national-marine-park/), a Chinese fishing vessel, *Min Long Yu*, ran aground on the same reef.  Not only did the ship have no business being anywhere near the protected reef, but Philippine officials found 22,000 pounds of of pangolin meat, a protected species of scaly anteater, aboard the fishing vessel.

“*It is bad enough that the Chinese have illegally entered our seas, navigated without boat papers and crashed recklessly into a national marine park and World Heritage Site,*” said Word Wildlife Fund-Philippines chief executive officer Jose Ma. Lorenzo Tan. *“It is simply deplorable that they appear to be posing as fishermen to trade in illegal wildlife.”*
