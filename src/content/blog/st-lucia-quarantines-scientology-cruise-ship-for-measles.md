![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fairwinds.jpg)The cruise ship MV *Freewinds* is described on the [Scientology website](https://www.scientology.org/faq/the-organization-of-scientology/what-is-the-freewinds.html) as “a religious retreat ministering the most advanced level of spiritual counseling in the Scientology religion.” It is also home to at least one confirmed case of the measles. The Caribbean nation of St. Lucia has quarantined the 440′ ship with 300 aboard in an attempt to avoid the spread of the contagious illness.

“Measles is a highly contagious disease. Anyone who is not adequately immunized against measles can contract the disease, if there has been close contact with a confirmed case,” according to a statement issued Wednesday by Dr. Merlene Fredericks-James, the island nation’s chief medical officer. “It is therefore likely that other persons on the boat may have been exposed.”

“The ship’s doctor has the confirmed case in isolation on the ship,” Dr. Fredericks-James added. “The individual is in stable condition.”

While no one has been allowed to leave the ship, St. Lucian authorities said they don’t have the authority to keep it from leaving. The ship is scheduled to leave St. Lucia at 11:59 p.m. on Thursday, officials said.

“The ship can leave our port, but we have no jurisdiction over their next destination,” Dr. Fredericks-James told NBC News.

The highly infectious disease, which can be prevented by a common vaccination, is in the midst of its [largest outbreak in a quarter century](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/30/health/measles-outbreak-by-state-map.html?module=inline) in the United States, with more than 700 cases reported.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scientology-ship-quarantined-measles-diagnosis-1206662) notes that Scientology has never made any public pronouncements discouraging members from vaccinations, but the organization’s aggressive opposition to other forms of Western medicine, specifically psychiatry, is well-documented.
