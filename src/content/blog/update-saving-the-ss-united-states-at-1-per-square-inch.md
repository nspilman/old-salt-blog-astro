[![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bigu.jpg)](https://savetheunitedstates.org/)In February 2011, [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/01/the-big-u-purchased-by-conservancy/) that the the [SS United States Conservancy](http://www.ssunitedstatesconservancy.org/news/_/2011/2/conservancy-purchases-ss-united-states-through-grant-from-lenfest-foundation/) had purchased the *[S.S. United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States)* from Norwegian Cruise Line.  The sale was made possible by a $5.8 million gift by Philadelphia philanthropist H.F. “Gerry” Lenfest.  Since then the Conservancy has raised $5 million of the estimated $25 million needed to  to restore the exterior and part of the interior of the ships to house a museum.

The Conservancy has now kicked off a new fundraising campaign and a new interactive web site – [Save the United States – Help restore America’s Flagship](https://savetheunitedstates.org/).  Visitors to the new web site can help save the ship at $1 per square inch by “purchasing” a piece of the ship. Visitors to the site can choose the section they want to sponsor by scrolling and zooming around a virtual model on the website, can “meet” other donors throughout the ship, personalize and upload images and memories of the ship, as well as share it through social media sites.  To donate and learn more, [click here](https://savetheunitedstates.org/).

From the [Conservancy press release](http://www.ssusc.org/news/_/2012/7/new-online-campaign-launches-to-save-the-united-states/):

*Today, the United States sits idle and in a state of disrepair in Philadelphia awaiting restoration and repurposing as a museum and stationary waterfront destination.* 

*“She bears the name of this great nation and deserves to be part of our future,” states Susan Gibbs, executive director of the SS United States Conservancy, which purchased the vessel last year. “This new campaign leverages the power of social networking and the internet like never before to ensure this ship is protected and restored for future generations. “We can’t bring the ship to everyone, so this interactive website will give visitors a chance to explore a virtual United States, learn about her people and history, and donate to create their own profiles within this historic vessel.”*

*SS United States* was delivered in 1952 for the United States Lines. The ship is the largest ocean liner constructed entirely in the US and was the fastest ocean liner to cross the Atlantic in either direction. Only five years after the ship went into service, Boeing introduced the 707 jet airliner, which would bring to an end the age of  passenger ships. The *SS United States* was retired from service in 1969.
