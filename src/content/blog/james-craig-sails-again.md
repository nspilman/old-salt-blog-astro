The almost 30 year restoration of the *[James Craig](http://www.shf.org.au/JCraig/JCraig.html)* is a wonderful story of volunteers rescuing an old windjammer, rusting away on a Tasmanian beach.  The three masted iron barque, *[James Craig](http://www.shf.org.au/JCraig/JCraig.html)*, originally named *Clan Macleod,* was built by Bartram, Haswell & Co. in Sunderland, England in 1874.  She had a long and generally productive carrier until she was abandoned in 1933.  In 1972 volunteers from the [Sydney Heritage Fleet](http://www.shf.org.au/index.html) re-floated her and began the restoration which would be finally completed in 2001.  Here is a trailer for a documentary about the restoration of this beautiful ship.  The *James Craig* now sails from Sydney harbor as part of the [Sydney Heritage Fleet](http://www.shf.org.au/index.html).
