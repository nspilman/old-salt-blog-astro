King's Point schooner Summerwind

The  *[Summerwind](http://usmmawaterfront.blogspot.com/2009/11/coast-guard-has-eaglewelcome-summerwind.html)*, a 1929 Alden schooner, donated to the US Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point just last year by Mr. and Mrs. J. Don Williamson,  won the Class AA division of the [Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race on corrected time](http://www.schoonerrace.org/pdfs/results10.pdf).  The other top contenders in Class AA (rated length greater than 50 feet) were the *[Pride of Baltimore II](http://www.pride2.org/index.php)* and the *[Lynx](http://www.privateerlynx.com/)*, both sharp built privateer replicas.   Congratualtions to King’s Point.  A very impressive performance.
