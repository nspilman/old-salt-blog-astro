In Canada, Kiska, an orca often referred to as “[the loneliest whale in the world](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/11/1162863883/kiska-the-loneliest-whale-in-the-world-dies-at-canada-amusement-park)” has died after spending over four decades in captivity at Marineland, a zoo and amusement park in Niagara Falls.  Kiska was the last captive killer whale in Canada and was captured in Icelandic waters in 1979 alongside [Keiko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiko_\(orca\)), the star of the movie, Free Willy, 

In Florida, steps are being taken to return the orca Tokitae to the waters of the Pacific north-west. The [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/30/lolita-orca-miami-seaquarium-release-tokitae) reports that Tokitae is the oldest killer whale in captivity. Now in retirement, she spent decades performing at the Miami Seaquarium, where she went by the name Lolita. She lived in the smallest orca enclosure in North America, in a pool of water that made her skin infected and was fed fish that was occasionally rotten and led to intestinal issues.

Over the years multiple groups, including members of the Lummi nation and animal rights organizations, have called for the whale’s release from the Seaquarium, with some staging protests outside the facility.

On Thursday, the owners of the Miami Seaquarium where Tokitae lives announced a “formal and binding agreement” with a group called the Friends of Lolita to begin the process of returning Tokitae to Puget Sound. A news release indicates that the joint effort is “working toward and hope the relocation will be possible in the next 18 to 24 months”.

Tokitae’s ordeal began in the calm waters of Penn Cove, Whidbey Island – a quiet island off the coast of Washington State – five decades ago. Men with long sticks and guns corralled a group of resident killer whales, separating mothers from their calves. At least a dozen of those whales died during the capture, and more than 50 were kept for captive display.

One of those calves was four-year-old Tokitae. Back home, the native Lummi people call her Sk’aliCh’elh-tenaut – meaning that she is a member of Sk’aliCh’elh, the resident family of orcas who call the Salish Sea home. The tribe, who views killer whales as part of their extended family, has never stopped fighting for her release.

There are still questions about Toki’s health and her ability to travel across the country to a sea pen. The pen would be constructed with the help of the non-profit [Whale Sanctuary Project](https://whalesanctuaryproject.org/), which is also creating the world’s first whale sanctuary off the coast of Nova Scotia, following the model of areas to house big cats, great apes or elephants after they have been in captivity.
