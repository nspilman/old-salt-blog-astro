Everyone likes superlatives. The oldest, fastest, newest, largest and so on. Often superlatives need to be very specific to be made to apply. [HMS *Victory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Victory), for example, is the oldest naval ship still in commission, while [USS *Constitution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution) is the oldest commissioned warship afloat. (Technically, USS *Constitution* is not currently afloat. Both HMS *Victory* and *USS Constitution* are now in drydock — a permanent condition for *Victory* and a temporary state for the *Constitution.)*

We recently posted about the [MV *Liemba,*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Liemba) which we described as the “[oldest passenger ferry](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/11/update-mv-liemba-oldest-passenger-ferry-turns-102/).” In a previous post, from two years ago, we also referred to her as the “[oldest passenger/cargo steamer.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/11/mv-liemba-the-worlds-oldest-passengercargo-steamer-at-100/)” It appears that neither claim may necessarily be accurate.

We received a comment from Robin Denny saying, “*However, I would take issue with \[the\] contention that \[Liemba\] is the oldest passenger/cargo “steamer” in the world. In 1899, my family’s yard in Dumbarton, Scotland, William Denny & Bros., built the steamship “[Sir Walter Scott](http://www.lochkatrine.com/about-the-loch/steamship-sir-walter-scott/)” for service on Loch Katrine. She has sailed every year since then, 116 years, but, unlike Liemba, she still runs her original triple expansion steam engine.*”

*Sir Walter Scott* is a beautiful craft described as “the only surviving screw steamer in regular passenger service in Scotland,” which no doubt is the case.

Our reference to *Liemba* as a steamer was a bit dodgy to start with as her triple expansion steam engine was replaced by diesels in 1970. So *Liemba* may not be the the oldest passenger ferry, although she might qualify as the oldest passenger/cargo ship in liner service, as she does carry considerable freight on the 400 mile long [Lake Tanganyika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tanganyika).  [Loch Katrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Katrine) where *Sir Walter Scott* is employed is only about 8 mile long, so their operations are rather different in scope.  

Mr. Denny went on to note,”*Another ancient steamship is the “[Yavari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavari_\(ship\))” on Lake Titicaca, built in 1862.*” The *Yavari* has not been a steamship for some time, however, as her 2-cylinder steam engine was removed in 1914 and replaced by a [Bolinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolinder-Munktell "Bolinder-Munktell") 4-cylinder 320 bhp [hot bulb engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_bulb_engine "Hot bulb engine"). The Yavari earns points for longevity but is not in operation, as she is undergoing restoration. Let us hope that she may return to active service in the future.

After being introduced to these illustrious vessels, one question came to mind. Which is the oldest operating steamship? The answer is not entirely obvious. Again, the specific terms of the superlative come into play. Are we discussing steamships or steamboats? Do yachts count? Does a steamship converted to diesel qualify? I won’t claim to have answers to these questions. Nevertheless, lets look at a few additional candidates built before 1900.

[S.L.(Steam launch) Nuneham](http://www.frenchbrothers.co.uk/thefleet/boatpdfs/NUNEHAM.pdf) was built in 1898. Following restoration she is now again coal fired and operating on the River Thames.

A decade older, [RMS Segwun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Segwun) is the “oldest operating steam driven vessel in North America,” built in 1887 on the Clyde in Scotland. She operates on Muskoka Lakes in Ontario, Canada and is one of only four ships in the world still carrying the status of Royal Mail Ship.

The oldest steamer may be the Norwegian [PS](https://www.skibladner.no/about-us/facts-about-skibladner) *[Skibladner](https://www.skibladner.no/about-us/facts-about-skibladner),* which began service in August 1856 on Lake Mjøsa. She is a side-wheel paddle steamer built in Motala Shipyard. She is billed as the “world’s oldest preserved paddle steamer in timetabled service.”

So, which vessels have we missed? Any older steamships still in service?
