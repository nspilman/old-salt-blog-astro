![anacecilia](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/anacecilia.jpg)Last week, we posted about the upcoming [scuttling of the *Luck Lady*, ex-*Newtown Creek*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/07/lucky-lady-ex-newtown-creek-scuttled-pompano-beach/), later this month as an artificial reef off Pompano Beach, FL. Recently, about fifty miles to the north of Pompano, the cargo ship [*Ana Cecilia*](http://www.palmbeachermagazine.com/noteworthy/watch-ana-cecilia-ship-sinking-riviera-beach-and-go-underwater-tour-new-artificial-reef) was sunk about 1.25 miles offshore off Rivera Beach, as the newest of 11 other vessels that that have been scuttled as artificial reefs in the immediate area.

The *Ana Cecilia* has a colorful past. She was the first vessel to  [deliver cargo from Miami to Cuba in 50 years](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/cuba/120714/ana-cecilia-first-us-ship-sailing-cuba-50-years-arrives-h) when she carried humanitarian aid in 2012. She was seized in September 2015 after Customs found more than 386 bricks of cocaine aboard, valued to $10 million. The ship was later donated to Palm Beach County in support of its system of more than 150 artificial reefs.
