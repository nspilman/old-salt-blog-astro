![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/voyaging-canoe.jpg)Genetic analysis of modern descendants shows that sailors from the Pacific Islands arrived in the Americas long before Europeans arrived. The question is how long?

A [recent study suggests Polynesians and Native Americans made contact some 800 years ago](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2487-2.epdf?sharing_token=5l3HcRDUAWe8jkMrGE1tTdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NQ-GCGXs3b23XyInVhVtT1AdcNQHZodtkKNjeo_SR6zlnT5rYX7fFr64ViulW31NnqUs_ilUTvJxsBJ9LryBu-GAWY5ZW37ax4T2dWtaxP8aRDKWwPfbhI_vYfH36UDYH4kgyqCA5jCVQcnCAq0ETvZGNubeDqJzQByABGjJR6rzk6C249LlUv1Q_DP_Znp_E%3D&tracking_referrer=www.smithsonianmag.com), well before Europeans arrived in North America.

The [DNA testing of a member of the Blackfoot tribe in Montona](https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2019/05/06/blackfeet-man-dna-deemed-oldest-americas-cri-genetics/3145410002/), however, suggests a far earlier interaction. When Darrell “Dusty” Crawford had his DNA tested last year by CRI Genetics, the company traced his line back 55 generations with a 99 percent accuracy rate. The company has never been able to trace anyone’s ancestry in the Americas as far back as Crawford’s DNA, they told him.

[Crawford’s DNA suggests his ancestors came from the Pacific](https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2019/05/06/blackfeet-man-dna-deemed-oldest-americas-cri-genetics/3145410002/), traveled to the coast of South America, and traveled north, according to CRI.  He’s part of Mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA) [Haplogroup B2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_B_\(mtDNA\)), which CRI dated back about 17,000 years ago.

While Crawford is only one individual, researchers have noted that while B2 is one of five haplogroups found among the indigenous peoples of the Americas, the B2 haplogroup does not generally appear in Alaska or Canada, making it less likely that the B2 ancestors traveled across the Bering Sea landbridge.

On the other hand, Haplogroup B2 represents approximately [23% of the mtDNAs in South America](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2018/05/16/gr.234674.118.full.pdf). Also, the [mtDNA most similar to American B2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_B_\(mtDNA\)#:~:text=Haplogroup%20B%20is%20now%20most,C%2C%20D%2C%20and%20X.) has been found mainly in populations of southern China and Southeast Asia. If the B2 ancestors did not walk across the landbridge, did they sail to South America from across the Pacific?
