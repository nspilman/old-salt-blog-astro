[Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/video/video/2017/05/watch_the_50_million_year_evolution_of_the_whale_in_1_minute.html) recently featured an animation of 50 million years of whale evolution represented in one minute. The animation is the work of Jordan Collver, an illustrator and science communicator in the U.K. Collver used a series of illustrations to show the slow-changing morphology of the ancient quadruped Pakicetus, as millions of years of aquatic adaptation shapes the land mammal into the modern sperm whale. If you would like to slow things down a bit, a [ten minute version of the animation is also available here](https://youtu.be/PEU1-GQ1Ax4).
