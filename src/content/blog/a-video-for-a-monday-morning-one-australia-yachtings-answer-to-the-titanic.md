A short video reminder of how quickly things can change. [One Australia’s AUS-35](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Louis_Vuitton_Cup#One_Australia) boat was racing in the Louis Vuitton qualifying matches in the America’s Cup of March 1995, when it suddenly broke in half and sank, in less than two minutes time.  Everyone escaped safely. It was the only America’s Cup race ever lost due to sinking.
