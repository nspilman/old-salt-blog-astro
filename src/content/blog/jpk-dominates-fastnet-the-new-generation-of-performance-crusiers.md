[JPK Composites](http://www.jpk.fr/?mode=contact), a boat builder from Brittany, is helping to redefine performance cruising sailboats. In 2013, the father and son team of [Pascal and Alexis Loison won the biannual Fastnet Race](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/sailing/pascal-and-alexis-loison-win-top-prize-in-rolex-fastnet-race-8763763.html) on corrected time, sailing their 33′ *Night and Day*, a [JPK 10.10](http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=8064) double-handed in a fleet of of 336 starters in the 611-mile race. It was the first time in 88 years that the race had been won by a double-handed crew. They were not, however, the only JPK 10.10s in the race.  Crews sailing JPK 10.10s also placed [second, eight, ninth, tenth and eleventh](http://fastnet.rorc.org/results/2013/rfr-irc-overall02.html).

In this year’s race, Géry Trentesaux and his 35′ *Courrier Du Leon*, a [JPK 10.80](http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=8298), won the Fastnet on corrected time. This was [Trentesaux’s thirteenth Fastnet race](http://www.rolexfastnetrace.com/Press-Releases-2015/lucky-13th-for-gery-trentesaux.html). Another [JPK 10.80 placed second, while JPG 10.10s placed third, fifth and ninth](http://www.rolexfastnetrace.com/results/2015/rfr-irc-overall02.html). An impressive showing.

The JPK 10.8 was also awarded the title of [2015 European Yacht of the Year](http://www.yachtingworld.com/blogs/toby-hodges-blog/5-top-new-yachts-crowned-european-yacht-year-2015-winners-25-tested-61420) in the performance cruiser category. Below decks the design is spacious, simple and open, with a vee berth forward, port and starboard settees in the cabin, a functional galley, chart table and after cabin with a double berth to port.  Quite nice for a race winning speedster.
