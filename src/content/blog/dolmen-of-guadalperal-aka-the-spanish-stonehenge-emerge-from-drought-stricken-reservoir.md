![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/spanishstonehenge.jpg)We recently posted about “[hunger stones](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/08/hunger-stones-emerge-as-extreme-drought-drops-water-levels-of-rhine-other-european-rivers/#more-59566)” revealed by falling water levels in the Rhine and Elbe rivers, as well as the emergence of a [graveyard of sunken German warships](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/08/wrecks-of-dozens-of-explosive-laden-nazi-ships-exposed-by-drought-in-serbian-danube/) filled with explosives and ammunition in the Serbian section of the Danube River, all caused by a near-record European drought.

In the Extremadura region of Spain, a far less threatening historical structure has emerged from the receding waters of Valdecanas reservoir — a megalithic monument officially known as the [Dolmen of Guadalperal but dubbed the Spanish Stonehenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolmen_of_Guadalperal), comprising a circle of dozens of stones believed to date back to 5000 BC.

It was [discovered by German archaeologist Hugo Obermaier in 1926](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/europes-drought-exposes-ancient-stones-world-war-two-ships-waters-fall-2022-08-20/), but the area was flooded in 1963 in a rural development project under Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. Since then it has only become fully visible four times.

“It’s a surprise, it’s a rare opportunity to be able to access it,” said archaeologist Enrique Cedillo from Madrid’s Complutense University, one of the experts racing to study the circle before it gets submerged again.

[Climate change has left the Iberian peninsula at its driest](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spanish-stonehenge-emerges-drought-hit-dam-2022-08-18/) in 1,200 years, and winter rains are expected to diminish further, a study published by the Nature Geoscience journal showed.
