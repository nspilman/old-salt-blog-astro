Cruiser Olympia, the oldest steel warship afloat, but for how long?

The day after Philadelphia’s tall ship, the newly repaired, *Gazela*, arrived in New York harbor, an article in this morning’s New York Times focussed on the three historic ships in trouble on the Delaware River, in or near Philadelphia – the *Olympia*, the battleship *New Jersey* and the passenger liner *SS United States*.  Sadly, the arguably most historic of the three ships, the *Olympia,* is the ship at the greatest risk with no currently viable rescue plan.

*They made an impressive display of America’s seafaring might, the aging maritime stars moored along both sides of the Delaware River.*

*There is the 1892 cruiser Olympia, the oldest steel warship afloat, whose guns and those of the ships it led blasted away a Spanish fleet in Manila Bay, announcing America’s arrival as a naval power. The ocean liner United States still holds the record for fastest westbound trans-Atlantic crossing. And the nation’s most decorated battleship, the World War II-era* [*New Jersey*](http://www.battleshipnewjersey.org/)*, repelled swarms of enemy aircraft.*

*But to their devoted keepers, the state of the historic trio is a depressing comedown from past glories. The ships are struggling in a world of threadbare private support and unpredictable government grants. Two of the three have barely avoided closing, or worse, with cash infusions that buy time but fall far short of saving them.*

*The most endangered, the Olympia, a National Historic Landmark, needs $10 million for hull repairs or it could go to a watery grave within three years, inspectors say. The owner, the* [*Independence Seaport Museum,*](http://www.phillyseaport.org/) *may close the ship this fall and dump it at sea to make an artificial reef. The museum and its ships have drawn about 90,000 visitors annually.*

*The hollowed-out United States has been rusting downriver since 1996, awaiting its last voyage to the scrapyard. A Philadelphia philanthropist, H. F. Lenfest, donated $5.8 million in June to buy the ship for a conservancy, which is pursuing development schemes, but the effort faces long odds.*

*The battleship New Jersey, docked in Camden, is in good shape physically, but it was nearly forced to close this summer after the State of New Jersey threatened to cut off $1.7 million in financing, about half its budget. Its paid staff was cut to 11, from 58 people four years ago, who oversee 250,000 visitors yearly.*
