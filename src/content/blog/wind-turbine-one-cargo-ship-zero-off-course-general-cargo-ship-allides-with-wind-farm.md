We missed this story the first time around, but it seems worthwhile to mention it, all the same. For what is being referred to as the first time it has occurred, a merchant ship had an allision with a wind turbine. The wind turbine won.

Last month, the 1,685 dwt general cargo ship [*Petra L*](https://www.fleetmon.com/vessels/petra-l_8205187_53557/) departed Szczecin, Poland loaded with 1,500 tons of gain bound for Antwerp. On the morning of April 25, she arrived in Emden, Germany, and port authorities noticed a hole the “size of a barn door” forward on the starboard side of the ship.  

Police report that the hole measured approximately 10 feet by 16 feet (3 meters by 5 meters) penetrating the hull. They reported that there were three officers and three crewmembers working aboard the vessel. None of them were injured.

[The Maritime Executive](https://maritime-executive.com/article/cargo-ship-arrives-in-germany-with-large-hole-after-striking-wind-farm) reports that German authorities made inquiries with the wind farm operators and said that Ørsted which operates the Gode Wind site approximately 25 miles off the German coast in the North Sea reported that its sensors at the wind farm had not detected any issues. However, a further survey of the wind farm, which has been operating since 2017 and consists of 97 turbines located in two sections, was undertaken by helicopter. Ørsted reportedly then confirmed to the German authorities that the visual survey detected “a small amount of damage,” in the field. The reports did not provide details.

The [turbine struck by the *Petra L* was put back into service around 24](https://www.offshorewind.biz/2023/05/30/cargo-ship-hit-gode-wind-turbine-went-back-into-service-in-24-hours-vessel-said-to-have-been-kilometres-off-course/) hours after being taken out of operation for inspection.

A review of the vessel’s data and AIS position shows that it was miles off course according to the German authorities. They are speculating that the ship was on autopilot and for unknown reasons drifted or deviated from its course. The data is reported to show that the vessel also slowed speed dramatically before altering course. Weather conditions were good in the North Sea which they believe is why the vessel was able to proceed to port without reporting the incident.

The Russian captain of the vessel promised a full statement after speaking with lawyers. The German authorities are reporting that he is facing charges for failing to report a maritime accident. Additional charges could be added pending the outcome of the investigation.

German authorities cite this as the first instance of a vessel underway striking a wind farm. Several supply and support vessels have allided with wind farm pedestals under construction, including [off Germany in 2019](https://safety4sea.com/vessel-hits-wind-turbine-as-master-takes-unnecessary-risk/) and [off Jersey in the Southern North Sea in 2020.](https://www.imca-int.com/safety-events/windfarm-support-vessel-njord-forseti-hit-wind-turbine-tower-jersey-maritime-administration/)
