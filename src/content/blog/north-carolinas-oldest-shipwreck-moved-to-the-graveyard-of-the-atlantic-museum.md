As a follow-up to a [post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/09/beachcomber-stumbles-upon-historical-shipwreck/) from early June,  the remains of what is believed to be the wreck of a merchant ship from the mid-1600s are being moved to the [Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum](http://www.graveyardoftheatlantic.com/index.htm) for preservation.  The wreck was uncovered by winter gales on Corolla beach on North Carolina’s Outer Banks and is believed  to be the oldest shipwreck ever found on the North Carolina coast.  The museum is about 90 miles from where the wreck was found.
