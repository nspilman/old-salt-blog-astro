![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hydropod3.jpg)For almost a decade, [Reza Baluchi has been trying to run across oceans](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/10/bubble-man-reza-baluchi-plans-to-try-running-to-bermuda-again/) in his hydro pod, a homemade bubble contraption with a metal frame that looks and is intended to function as a human hamster wheel.

As reported by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/us/man-runs-eastern-seaboard-hamster-wheel.html?searchResultPosition=1), a man popped out of the top hatch of the contraption, a makeshift human hamster wheel. He had made it only 25 miles on what was supposed to be a 1,000-plus-mile journey from St. Augustine, Fla., to New York, using the power of his two legs and, if all had gone according to plan, the Gulf Stream.

The man, Reza Baluchi, said in an interview on Monday that he had spent thousands of dollars and nearly a decade on making improvements to the homemade craft, called a hydro pod. It was equipped with a satellite phone, a water filtration system, a solar array, neoprene wet suits and a stockpile of granola and ramen noodles for when he embarked from St. Augustine on Friday for what he expected would be a three-week trip.

But the next day, when Mr. Baluchi, 49, realized that his backup GPS device and charging cables were missing — he said they were stolen — he cut short his Homeric odyssey. His aborted adventure startled and bemused beachgoers.

This is not Baluchi’s first attempt. In 2014, he [attempted to run the almost 1,000 miles from Florida to Bermuda](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/10/bubble-man-reza-baluchi-plans-to-try-running-to-bermuda-again/) in his hydro pod. Not surprisingly, he made it about 70 miles before he needed rescue by the US Coast Guard.  The rescue cost taxpayers roughly $144,000.

In 2016,  Bauchi tried again, but this time, the [Coast Guard told him to turn around](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/04/bubble-man-reza-baluchi-tries-again-coast-guard-says-no/) not far from shore before putting himself or others in danger. After warning him not to leave port without a support vessel, the US Coast Guard intercepted Baluchi in his inside his hydro pod about 7 miles off the coast of Jupiter, Florida. 

After his most recent attempt, the CoastGaurd is again cracking down. A spokesman for the Coast Guard said in an email on Tuesday that Mr. Baluchi would not be allowed to continue his voyage until he complied with a directive known as a captain of the port order that requires him to have an escort or support vessel, specific safety and navigation equipment, and a voyage plan.

“Failure to comply with Captain of the Port Orders is punishable by a civil penalty of up to $95,881,” said the spokesman, David Micallef. “There may also be criminal penalties for violating the order.”

The hydro pod remained beached near an oceanfront resort.
