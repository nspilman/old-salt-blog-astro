We have [posted previously about the world’s fasted sailboat, the hydrofoil trimaran, Hydroptère](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/03/20/hydroptere-%E2%80%93-fastest-on-the-water-sets-sights-offshore/), which in November 2009, sailed for one nautical mile at speed of 50.17 knots in Hyères, France. He also has achieved a sustained speed of 52.86 knots for 500m.  Now a very different boat, the [Vestas Sailrocket](http://www.sailrocket.com/) is attempting to challenge the flying trimaran for the record.
