![lilacstern1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lilacstern1.jpg)The [U.S.C.G. Cutter *Lilac*](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/home.html), America’s only steam-powered lighthouse tender, is reopening on May 19th at her berth on Hudson River Park’s Pier 25 at West Street and N. Moore Street in New York. This season, the historic ship will host the *[Lilac Arts Series](http://www.lilacarts.org/)* from May 19 to August 15, 2015.  To celebrate the new exhibition, the ship will host a reception on Tuesday, May 19, 2015, 6-9pm.  If you are in the neighborhood be sure to stop by.

The exhibit will focus on three themes inspired by the ship’s story – “*Steam*”, “*Work + Labor*” and “*Restoration/Reinvention*“. The visual art exhibition will feature the work of over 25 artists within the ship’s unique spaces, including several site-specific installations. In addition to the exhibition, the *Lilac* will host performances, artist talks, film screenings, readings, community activities and educational events. The schedule of events is available on the [Lilac Arts Series website at www.lilacarts.org](http://www.lilacarts.org/). The exhibition and events are all free and open to the public.

[Lilac Preservation Project](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/home.html) President, Mary Habstritt, commented, “We are thrilled to sponsor the Lilac Arts Series as part of our mission to introduce new audiences to our historic ship and especially to provide space to showcase work inspired by this unique vessel and our efforts to preserve her.” Melinda Wang, founder of [MW Projects](http://www.mw-projects.com/) and organizer of the Lilac Arts Series, added, “Through the exhibition and event programming, we aim to activate the ship’s spaces and encourage artists and audiences to be part of the Lilac’s story. We are very excited to work with emerging artists and art groups to create a new art destination in New York City.”

The [Lilac Preservation Project](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/home.html) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to restore the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Lilac as a unique vehicle for maritime education and community activities. The *Lilac* is a 1933 lighthouse tender that once carried supplies to lighthouses and maintained buoys for the U.S. Lighthouse Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Decommissioned in 1972, the *Lilac* is now a historic museum ship berthed at Hudson River Park’s Pier 25 in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City. The *Lilac* regularly hosts free exhibitions, tours and educational programs. For more information, visit [www.lilacpreservationproject.org.](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/home.html)
