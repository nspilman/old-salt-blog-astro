USS Macon

In Marvel comics and movies, the mobile headquarters of the fictional intelligence/defense agency [S.H.I.E.L.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D. "S.H.I.E.L.D.") is a flying aircraft carrier, referred to as a “[Helicarrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicarrier).”  In the comic books, the flying aircraft carrier first appeared in 1965, which raises the obvious question — why was Marvel so far behind the times?

The US Navy had two flying aircraft carriers in the 1930s. The two sister rigid airships, [USS *Macon* (ZRS-5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Macon_\(ZRS-5\)) and [USS *Akron* (ZRS-4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Akron_\(ZRS-4\)), each carried five single-seat Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk for scouting or two-seat Fleet N2Y-1 for training.  The airships were designed to serve as long range scouts to locate and report on enemy ships, using onboard scout planes, which the airships could both launch and recover. The were intended to be the high-tech early-20th-century version of 18th century frigates, which also served as the “eyes of the fleet.”

Just slightly smaller than the *[Hindenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ_129_Hindenburg)*, the USS *Macon* and USS *Akron* were among the largest rigid airships ever built. Unlike the *Hindenberg*, which was filled with hydrogen gas, the two American airships were filled with non-flammable helium.  The *Hindenberg*  was destroyed by fire in 1937, with the loss of thirty-six. Despite using the notionally safer helium, the USS *Akron w*as destroyed in a thunderstorm off the coast of New Jersey in 1933, killing 73 of the 76 crewmen and passengers, the greatest loss of life in any known airship crash.

Only two years later, the USS *Macon* was also destroyed in a storm. It crashed off the coast of California’s Big Sur.  Unlike the USS *Akron,* only two of the 76 crew members were lost, due at least in part to safety measures instituted after the tragedy of the crash of the USS *Akron. USS Macon* was the last rigigd airship ever built by the US Navy.

in 1991, the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute](http://www.mbari.org/) (MBARI) located the wreck of USS *Macon.* An additional survey was performed in 2006.  On August 18th, the team of [E/V *Nautilus*](http://www.nautiluslive.org/ev-nautilus) released video of their recent exploration of the wreck in which they found parts of the ship as well as the Sparrowhawk biplanes it carried.
