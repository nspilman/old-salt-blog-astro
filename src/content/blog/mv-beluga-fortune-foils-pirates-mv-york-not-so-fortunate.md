MV Beluga Fortune

Over the weekend, Somali pirates seized two ships in two days.  On Saturday, pirates seized the *MV York*, a liquefied petroleum gas tanker, off the coast of Kenya.   On Sunday, pirates seized the *[MV Beluga Fortune](http://www.beluga-group.com/de/#Flottendatenbank-Mehrzweck-Schwergutfrachter-F-Serie)* about 1,200 miles east of Mombasa, Kenya.  The crew of the *MV Beluga Fortune* locked themselves in a panic room, switched off the main engine, cut off the fuel supply, blocked the bridge and reported the Indian Ocean attack to military forces.  When the rescue team arrived today, the pirates had already abandoned the ship.
