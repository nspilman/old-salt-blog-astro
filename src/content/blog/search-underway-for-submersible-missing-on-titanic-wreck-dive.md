Missing submersible Titan

The US Coast Guard is searching for a submersible carrying five people on a dive on the wreck of the [*Titanic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic) in the North Atlantic off Newfoundland. The [submersible *Tita*n](https://oceangate.com/our-subs/titan-submersible.html), which began its dive towards the *Titanic* wreck site on Sunday morning, lost contact with the research vessel *Polar Prince* an hour and 45 minutes into the dive, according to the US Coast Guard. 

[Sky News](https://news.sky.com/story/uk-billionaire-hamish-harding-on-board-missing-titanic-submersible-family-confirms-12905616) is reporting that UK billionaire [Hamish Harding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamish_Harding) is one of five people on board the missing tourist submersible. Two others reported to be on board are French submersible pilot, Paul-Henry Nargeolet, and chief executive and founder of [OceanGate Expeditions](https://oceangate.com/expeditions/titanic-survey-expedition.html), Stockton Rush.

OceanGate Expeditions, the operator of the submersible, said in a statement on Monday that it was “mobilizing all options” to rescue those on the underwater vessel.   

The submersible *Titan* is made of titanium and carbon fiber, weighs about 21,000 pounds, and is listed as measuring 22 feet by 9.2 feet by 8.3 feet, with 96 hours of “life support” for five people.

OceanGate chartered the [MV *Polar Prince*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCGS_Sir_Humphrey_Gilbert), the ex-CCGS *Sir Humphrey Gilbert*, to serve as the ship on the surface near the dive site. The company’s website outlines an eight-day itinerary for the trip out of St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada. The site says customers do not require any previous diving experience, but that there are “a few physical requirements like being able to board small boats in active seas.”

OceanGate has led previous tourist trips to the wreck of the *Titanic* at a cost of $250,000 per person.

The [US Coast Guard warned that the search](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/19/us/titanic-missing-sub-tourist-tour), taking place approximately 900 miles east off Cape Cod, has been “challenging” due to the remote location.

Rear Adm. John Mauger, commander of the First Coast Guard District, said: “It is a remote area and it is a challenge to conduct a search in that area” but added, “We’re deploying all available assets”.

The [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12211631/Missing-OceanGate-Titanic-sub-vanished-HOURS-summer.html) reports that the *Titan* has disappeared before. During an expedition last summer, the vessel lost communication with its mothership for two and a half hours.
