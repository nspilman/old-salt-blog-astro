![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/01/olympia3.jpg)Back in February of last year, the [Independence Seaport Museum](http://www.phillyseaport.org/) announced that it could no longer afford to care for *[USS Olympia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Olympia_\(C-6\)),* the flagship of [Commodore George Dewey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dewey) at the [Battle of Manila Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manila_Bay) during the [Spanish-American War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish-American_War) in 1898.  There was open discussion of scrapping or sinking the historic ship if a new owner could not be found. Ironically the museum, plagued by scandal and financial malfeasance, lacked the funds to dredge around the Olympia so that she could be the vessel could be towed away from her berth on the Delaware River in Philadelphia.

Now, slightly over a year later, the Olympia’s rescue is not assured, but there are at least four groups trying to save her.   In addition to the [South Carolina Olympia Committee](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/04/28/beaufort-group-bids-on-the-cruiser-olympia/) and the [Navy Yard Association of Mare Island](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/20/group-campaigning-to-move-the-uss-olympia-to-san-francisco/), the [Friends of the Cruiser Olympia](http://cruiserolympia.org/site/) is working to keep the ship in Philadelphia while [Save USS Olympia, Inc.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Save-USS-Olympia/159562554091655?v=app_10442206389&ref=ts) seeks to move the ship to Baltimore.
