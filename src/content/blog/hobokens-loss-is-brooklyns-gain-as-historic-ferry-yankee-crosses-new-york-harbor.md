About two years, ago we posted about two historic vessels in New York harbor, the [ferry *Yankee*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_\(ferry\)) and the [tanker *Mary Whalen*](http://portsidenewyork.org/mary-a-whalen/).  In the space of two days, two different real estate and design publications featured articles about the grand old vessels, prompting us to ask “[Are Historic Ships Getting Trendy in the Big Apple?](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/08/historic-ships-getting-trendy-in-the-big-apple/)”

We may have been overly optimistic.  As it turns out both historic ships have had their share of real estate issues.  The ferry *Yankee* was recently evicted from a berth in Hoboken and the tanker *Mary A. Whalen* has been looking for a suitable home for some time now. Fortunately for both ships, and for ship lovers in New York and environs, it looks just possible that both vessels may find a home on the other side of the harbor from Hoboken in Red Hook, Brooklyn.

**Hoboken’s Loss is Brooklyn’s Gain – the Ferry *Yankee* Crosses the Harbor**

The 106-year-old 150-foot-long steel ferry, *Yankee*, was docked in Hoboken for more than seven years.  For the first six, it was alongside a private pier in the Shipyard Marina, but after Superstorm Sandy, the ferry relocated two piers south to city-owned Pier 12 on a temporary emergency basis.  In April, the Yankee was given an eviction notice, and despite efforts to reach an agreement with the city, was [towed out of Hoboken on July 2](http://hoboken.patch.com/groups/house-and-home/p/hoboken-loses-historic-ship-after-city-crew-cant-reach-agreement).

Fortunately, Hoboken’s loss was Brooklyn’s gain. A new home across the water was waiting for *Yankee* at the Henry Street pier in Red Hook.  With the help of the [Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance](http://www.waterfrontalliance.org/), the ferry’s owners’, Victoria and Richard Mackenzie-Childs, [connected with John Quadrozzi Jr.](http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/36/28/dtg_historicshipatredhook_2013_07_12_bk.html) of the [Gowanus Bay Terminal](http://www.gowanusbayterminal.com/), who allowed the ferry to dock at his pier in Red Hook.

The ferry *Yankee* has a long and illustrious history.  Built with a steel hull and three decks in 1906 in Philadelphia,  the vessel has served as a passenger ferry, a troop transport in both world wars, and is the last surviving Ellis Island ferry.  The *Yankee* was registered as an historic vessel with the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

**Will Red Hook Become New York Harbor’s Home for Historic Ships?** 

As we have posted previously, the tanker *Mary A. Whalen,* has been looking for a suitable home for some time now. (See our post – [No City for Old Tankers](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/no-city-for-old-tankers-mary-a-whalen-in-the-new-york-times/).)  The historic tanker is currently inaccessible to the public in a berth at the Red Hook Container terminal.  If all goes well, the *Mary A. Whalen* may become a neighbor of the ferry *Yankee*.  Quadrozzi is also in talks with PortSide NewYork, the owner of the [Mary A. Whalen,](http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/36/22/all_tankerbirthday_2013_05_31_bk.html) to have that boat moved permanently at the [Gowanus Bay Terminal](http://www.gowanusbayterminal.com/) Columbia Street pier.  If negotiations go well, Red Hook may yet be be a home for New York’s historic ships. Two historic ships is not a fleet but it is a good start.
