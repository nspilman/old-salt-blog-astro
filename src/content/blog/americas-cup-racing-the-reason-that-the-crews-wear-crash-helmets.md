I have a distinct recollection a photo of [Thomas Lipton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Lipton) on one of his [Americas Cup challengers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_V) sipping a cup of the tea on which his fortune was based.  I can’t find the photograph, so perhaps I shouldn’t trust my memory.  Nevertheless, it is safe to say that [America’s Cup](http://www.americascup.com/) racing has changed.  These days the sailors don’t sip tea from porcelain cups; they wear crash helmets. Last Friday, Russell Coutts, skipper of the Oracle boat demonstrated why the helmets are a good idea when he tried, unsuccessfully, to squeeze between the Race Committee boat and another racer at a speed of around 20 knots.  Thanks to Irwin Bryan for passing along the video.
