![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/arrmada.jpg)The [Royal Navy](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2023/june/29/20230629-armada-maps) has announced that it is putting on display one of the greatest treasures in British naval history before they return to storage for months, perhaps years, to protect them.

The [Armada Maps](https://www.nmrn.org.uk/news/extremely-rare-spanish-armada-maps-be-put-display-first-time-their-history-national-museum) chart the Royal Navy’s defeat of the Spanish fleet – or armada – in 1588, one of the defining moments in the history of the navy, nation, and Europe.

The ten hand-drawn maps – compiled just one year after the victory – follow the progress of the Spanish force (141 ships and 24 thousand men) and the better-led, better-trained, and more professional British fleet which thwarted their invasion plans.

The clashes with the Spanish in the summer of 1588 are the first battle honors awarded in Royal Navy history, held by some of the greatest names in the Fleet such as HMS *Ark Royal.*

Due to the exceptionally fragile nature of the maps, they can only go on public display for a limited time – until Tuesday, August 8 – at the [National Museum of the Royal Navy](https://www.nmrn.org.uk/) in Portsmouth before returning to the archive for preservation.

It could be several years before individual maps, let alone the entire collection, receive another public airing.
