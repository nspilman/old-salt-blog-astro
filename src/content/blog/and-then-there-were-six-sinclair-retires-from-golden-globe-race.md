![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sinclair.jpg)Last week we posted about the [rescue of Golden Globe racer Susie Goodall](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/12/susie-goodall-rescued-by-cargo-ship-tian-fu/), whose boat pitchpoled and was dismasted in the Southern Ocean. Goodall was the eleventh of the original eighteen sailors in the race to either withdraw or require rescue.  Now, one more sailor, [Mark John Sinclair](https://goldengloberace.com/skipper/mark-john-sinclair/), has withdrawn from the [Golden Globe Race](https://goldengloberace.com).  Sinclair, a 60-year-old Australian, sailing *Coconut*, a Lello 34 Masthead sloop, had reached Australia when he chose to retire from the race. 

Sinclair’s calculation was simple. He had taken too long to reach the half-way point in the race and at his current average speed would arrive too late in the season at Cape Horn. Earlier in the race, Sinclair had run perilously low on freshwater. 

Six sailors are still competing in the race, which has seen five dismastings and three rescues. 

The 2018-2019 Golden Globe Race celebrates the 50th anniversary of the original race in 1968. The current race is being sailed in fiberglass boats between 33 and 36 feet long with full-length keels with rudders attached to the trailing edge. They are also limited to only equipment that was available in the original race.
