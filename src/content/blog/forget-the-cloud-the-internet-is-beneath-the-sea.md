![underseacable](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/02/underseacable.jpg)In describing the internet, people often talk of “the cloud.”  We connect through over an ethernet, where ether is an archaic term from the Latin aethēr ‎meaning “the upper pure, bright air.”  But as they say in Brooklyn, fuhgeddaboutit! Most of the internet is beneath the sea carried by submarine communications cables. [By some accounts](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html?_r=0), the cables carry 95 percent of daily communications. Now there are serious concerns in the US military and intelligence that [Russian submarines and spy ships](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html?_r=0) are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications. If the Russians, or anyone else, should attack the cables, they could potentially shut potentially shut down large sections of the Internet.

While there has been lots of scary talk about lasers taking out satellites and electromagnetic pulse weapons frying all electronics, the only thing the Russians need to take out a submarine cable is a large cable cutter. The underwater cables are also surprisingly vulnerable. As reported in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2015/10/undersea-cable-maps/):

*“We usually think of the internet as distributed,” Nicole Starosielski, a media scholar at New York University, says. Because of the built-in redundancies, an attack at a given point in the terrestrial network is unlikely to bring the whole thing down. Not so under the sea. “I think people would be surprised to know that there are a little over 200 systems that carry all of the internet traffic across the ocean, and these are by and large concentrated in very few areas. The cables end up getting funneled through these narrow pressure points all around the globe.”*

Stephen Colbert recently looked at the problem of what Americans might do if submarine cables were cut or disrupted. He assembles an “Internet disruption go bag.”
