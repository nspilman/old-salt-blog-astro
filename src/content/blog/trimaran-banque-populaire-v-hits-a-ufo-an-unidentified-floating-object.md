The press release, translated from the French by Google, reads, “[Maxi Banque Populaire V hit a UFO](http://www.voile.banquepopulaire.fr/espace-presse/Maxi-Trimaran-Banque-Populaire-V/Le-Maxi-Banque-Populaire-V-a-heurte-un-OFNI-3818.html)\*. ”   The footnote clarifies that the trimaran hit an “unidentified floating object.”   (Late last month [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/22/trimaran-banque-populaire-attempts-to-win-jules-verne-trophy/) about the trimaran [*Banque Populaire V*](http://www.voile.banquepopulaire.fr/) setting off from Brest in an attempt to win the [Jules Verne Trophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_Trophy).)  Nevertheless, the entire account has an otherworldly aspect.  
  
The trimaran apparently hit an object in the water while traveling at 37 knots ( 43 mph).   It appears that they have damaged a 600 kg dagger board and its associated “crash-box”  (le barreau de la dérive .  If anyone has better translation, please pass it along.)  To be prudent, they slowed to 25 knots and headed for calmer waters for a complete inspection.   They are currently attempting to repair the damaged dagger board.  For most of us the idea of “slowing down” to 25 knots in a sailboat  is quite remarkable in its own right.

The [Jules Verne Trophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_Trophy) is currently held by French trimaran *[Groupama 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupama_3)* which in March of last year set the new around the world speed record of 48 days, 7 hours 44 minutes and 52 seconds, the fastest circumnation sped recorded for a yacht of either sail or power.   The fastest recorded powerboat circumnavigation was 61 days by the ill-fated *[Ady Gil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MY_Ady_Gil)*, which was later [scuttled by the Sea Shepherds](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/10/07/whale-wars-war-of-words-sinking-of-the-ady-gil-ordered-by-watson/) following a collision with a Japanese whaler.

Prior to the collision with the unidentified floating object, the *[Banque Populaire V](http://www.voile.banquepopulaire.fr/)* was ahead of the where *[Groupama 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupama_3)* had been at the same time in the voyage and had recorded [passages of 700 nautical miles per day](http://yachtpals.com/node/14791).
