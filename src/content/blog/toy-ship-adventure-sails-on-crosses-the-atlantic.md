![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/09/adventurepeterhead.jpg)The extremely small ship *Adventure* sails on. Last year [we posted about the Playmobil toy pirate ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=47533&action=edit), named *Adventure*, launched by brothers Ollie and Harry Ferguson, 9 and 6 years old, respectively, from the port of Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. After adding ballast and flotation to the just less than two-foot-long craft, the brothers sent *Adventure* to sea, with a note asking anyone who found the little ship to contact the boys and then send *Adventure* on its way. 

Last summer the unlikely craft sailed about 390 miles to Denmark, then on to Sweden and then Norway. In Norway, it was taken aboard the full-rigged training ship, [*Christian Radich,*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Radich) which, late last year carried the craft into the Atlantic and launched it off the coast of Mauritania. A GPS tracker was also added to the tiny vessel.  Recent reports have *Adventure* off the coast of South America, bound roughly for Barbados.
