Last Thursday, the mellifluous blast of the *[SS Normandie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Normandie)*‘s steam whistle once gain reverberated across the piers of the South Street Seaport in New York.   The blowing of the steam whistle celebrated the anniversary of the arrival of French luxury liner to New York seventy five years ago.   A new exhibit at the South Street Seaport Museum also celebrates the grand old ship – [DecoDence: Legendary Interiors and Illustrious Travelers Aboard the SS Normandie](http://www.seany.org/index1.aspx?BD=9629).  
  
I had every intention to stop by the Seaport to hear the whistle blow but couldn’t get away. Fortunately Will at the [Tugster blog](http://tugster.wordpress.com/) video-taped the proceedings.   While this was the first time in 25 years that the Normandie’s steam whistle has sounded at the seaport,  its beautiful bellow is heard yearly  at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.  [Conrad Milster](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5076759), the chief engineer at the Pratt Institute, has been the custodian of the whistle for 25 years.
