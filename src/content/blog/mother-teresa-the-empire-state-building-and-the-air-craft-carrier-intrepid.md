This August 26th will be the one hundredth anniversary of [Mother Teresa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa)‘s birth.  The [Empire State Building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_state_building) in New York City changes its lighting for major holidays and special events.  The Catholic League has requested that the building be lit blue and white in honor of Mother Teresa’s hundredth birthday, but the building managers declined citing policy against [“lighting for religious figures or requests by religions and religious organizations.”](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jLUcyVMQU3TkY2MU3BaL7M2Gg8pAD9G843000) Outrage has ensued.   Now the USS [Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum has announced](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/06/uss_intrepid_will_honor_mother.html) that they will be lighting the *Intrepid* in honor of Mother Teresa.   Has no one noticed the irony of lighting a warship in honor of a champion of non-violence?
