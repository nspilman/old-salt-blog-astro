One of my favorite blogs is Will van Dorp’s [Tugster : a water blog](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/ny-times-discovers-the-sixth-boro/) – part shipspotting, part anthropology and part wry commentary on life and the universe, Will and his omnipresent camera do a great job covering New York’s “six borough.”   Those who know New York might note that there are only five boroughs – Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx.  The [Tugster](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/ny-times-discovers-the-sixth-boro/) blog covers the sixth  –  the great harbor and the network of waterways that separate and also bind together the great city of New York.   Yesterday, the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/) took note of Will’s work on [Tugster](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/ny-times-discovers-the-sixth-boro/):

[A Blog for the ‘Sixth Borough’](http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/18/a-blog-for-the-sixth-borough/?scp=1&sq=a%20blog%20of%20the%20sixth%20borough&st=cse)  
  
*Tugster, a blog by Will Van Dorp covering the city’s harbor through daily, photograph-filled posts, seems at first to be a narrow alcove geared toward seafaring captains or tugboat aficionados. Yet Mr. Van Dorp, who began Tugster in 2006 as a “working water vessel ethnology,” has attracted a broad audience. Professional mariners and landlocked lawyers alike, he said, are drawn in by his enthusiasm for “the sixth borough,” his nickname for New York’s waterways.*

*Part of Tugster’s appeal is the varied tone and focus of Mr. Van Dorp’s posts. “Some are technical, some are historical, some are whimsical, some provide a journey,” he said. “I like to think I can draw the whimsy-focused people in to the technical parts of the harbor and vice versa.” On a given week, visitors might encounter a poetic ode to a favorite tug named Alice; a photo-identification challenge called “Whatzit?”; and detailed primers on ship hulls or ice-breaking.*

*Whatever he posts, Mr. Van Dorp prioritizes interaction with his audience. He frequently replies on comment threads and highlights readers’ experiences and observations. Photographs of “things I or others don’t understand,” for example, quickly receive a crowd-sourced explanation. That, he said, is what makes Tugster a real New York blog. “We like to learn and get things right,” he said. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re an expert or a novice; that’s the magic of the Internet.”*

*BEHIND THE SCREEN:  Mr. Van Dorp, 59, who described himself as “the Jane Goodall of tugboats,” said he was born into his love for New York Harbor. His parents, Dutch immigrants, came over on a ship from Rotterdam to Hoboken in 1949 and often recounted to him their exhilarating first glimpse of Lady Liberty.*
