The Navy has selected an active-duty female gunner’s mate for promotion to master chief petty officer for the first time in the service’s 230-year history.

Senior Chief Gunner’s Mate Jessica Saunders, who joined the Navy in 2002, was slated for its highest enlisted rank last week, the service said in a [statement](https://www.netc.navy.mil/Media-Center/News-Stories/News-Stories-Display/Article/3410205/the-us-navys-first-female-gunners-mate-to-screen-for-master-chief-petty-officer/) Tuesday.

“This is not only a significant milestone for my naval career but for all sailors,” Saunders said in the statement. “The glass ceiling is shattered. From the day I enlisted, I understood that with hard work, motivational leadership, and a warfighter mentality, I could achieve my goals and help better our Navy for future generations.”

Saunders was accepted for enlisted status and placed into the Delayed Entry Program (DEP) in September 2001 and enlisted in the U.S. Navy on Aug. 6, 2002. Over the course of more than 20 years of service, she has served aboard USS Sacramento (AOE 1), USS Cole (DDG 67), USS Spruance (DDG 111), USS Cowpens (CG 63), and USS Lake Champlain (CG 57).   
   
In addition to tours at sea, she served at Naval Air Station Sigonella’s Weapons Department, Naval Station Mayport Security Detachment, Commander, Littoral Combat Ship Squadron One, and Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet.  In February 2023, she reported to SCSTC SD as the ammunition supply administration and ordnance officer Instructor and ETD departmental leading chief petty officer.   
   
“Back in the 1990s when I reported aboard my first ship as gunnery officer, there were no females at that time in the armory,” said Capt. Justin Long, commanding officer, SCSTC SD.  “As I retire later this summer from the Navy, I’m so proud to see outstanding Sailors and leaders, like GMCS Saunders, at the highest levels of their communities. As she said herself, ‘the glass ceiling is shattered!’ Congratulations GMCS Saunders on continuing to blaze a trail for female Sailors from all backgrounds and walks of life.”
