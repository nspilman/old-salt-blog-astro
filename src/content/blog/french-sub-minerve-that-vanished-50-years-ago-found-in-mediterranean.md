![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/07/minerve.jpg)In January 1968, the French submarine [*Minerve*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_submarine_Minerve_\(S647\)) was underway in the Mediterranean on her way back to her home base in Toulon. Communications from the submarine advised that she would be at her [berth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berth_\(moorings\) "Berth (moorings)") in about an hour.  Then mysteriously, the diesel-electric submarine vanished. Despite an extensive search by the French navy, no trace was found of the submarine and her crew of 6 officers and 46 sailors.

Over 50 years after the *Minerve’s* disappearance, the French government contracted with the American ocean-mapping company [Ocean Infinity](https://oceaninfinity.com/) to continue the search. Yesterday, Ocean Infinity announced that their Norwegian flag research vessel [Seabed Constructor](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/shipid:305289/zoom:13) had located the wreckage of the *Minerve* in about 7,800 feet of water, roughly 28 miles south of the French port city of Toulon.  

In November, the same research vessel operated by Ocean Infinity located the [wreckage of the missing Argentine submarine *San Juan*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/11/wreckage-of-missing-argentine-submarine-san-juan-located-in-deep-atlantic/).

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/world/europe/france-submarine-minerve.html) reports that the *Minerve* was found in three sections, spread across 330 yards, said Stanislas Gentien, a spokesman for the Mediterranean’s Maritime Prefecture, in Toulon. The first four letters of the vessel’s name — MINE, written in red — were visible on the main piece of wreckage, leaving little doubt about the submarine’s identity, he said.

The cause of the loss of *Minerve* so close to her home port remains unknown. 

!968 was a distinctly bad year for submarines. *Minerve* sank two days after the Israeli submarine [INS *Dakar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Dakar) disappeared in the eastern Mediterranean between Crete and Cyprus. Two other submarines were lost to unknown causes in the same year; the Soviet [submarine *K-129*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_K-129_\(1960\)) and the American [USS *Scorpion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Scorpion_\(SSN-589\)).
