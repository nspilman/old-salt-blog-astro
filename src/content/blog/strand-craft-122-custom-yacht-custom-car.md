It is such a relief that we never really have to worry about the very wealthy among us running out of places to spend their money.   Here may be but the latests example of where those with more money than sense can drop  a seizable sum.  The *Strand Craft 122* promises to be a super yacht with a super car.  Each 38 meter mega-yacht comes with a matching custom automobile.

*“It would be the perfect boat for James Bond,” Strand Kraft founder Kurt Strand told The Post. “He likes the extravagant style and \[the car\] is the ultimate luxury feature you can have.”*

*The supercar, sporting the same metallic paint job as its mother ship, features an eye-popping, 880 horsepower, twin-turbo V12 engine with a top speed of 230 mph.*

*“You have to buy the yacht to get the car,” Strand said. “It will be . . . the most exclusive car in the world.”*

*The boat is no slouch either, coming with two main diesel engines and a Rolls Royce turbine booster engine that together can make it hit a top speed of 55 knots.*

*Neither the yacht nor the car is yet in production — but Strand says his company is already meeting with potential buyers. The first delivery won’t be until 2013.*
