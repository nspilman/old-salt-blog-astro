Here is a short demonstration video from Toby Hodges at [Yachting World](https://www.yachtingworld.com/) of Neoocean’s [Overboat](https://www.neocean.com/overboat/) electric personal foiler. Unlike the noisy and generally noxious jetski, the Overboat is practically silent, uses roughly 80% less energy than a comparable outboard motor-driven boat and produces zero emissions on the water. It is capable of running for 2 hours at 12 knots on three lithium batteries, riding on four computer-controlled foils. One downside is that, like most new technology, it is a bit pricey, at around £20,000. With luck, the price will drop as the technology matures and production increases.
