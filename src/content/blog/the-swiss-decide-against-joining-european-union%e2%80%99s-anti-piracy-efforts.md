Swiss lawmakers have decided against joining EU anti-piracy efforts because it would violate the country’s long-held tradition of neutrality.  The land-locked country lacks a blue water navy so could not send a ship or ships to support the efforts but  had considered sending thirty military support personnel.    The Swiss navy does operate ten patrol boats on Lakes Konstanz and Leman.  Thirty-two merchant ships in international trade fly the Swiss flag.
