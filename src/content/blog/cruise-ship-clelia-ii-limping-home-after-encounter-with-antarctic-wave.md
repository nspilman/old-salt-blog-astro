While the circumstances were completely different from those on the *[Carnival Splendor](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/index.php?s=Carnival+Splendor+)*, the problem encountered by the cruise ship [*Clelia II*](http://www.polarcruises.com/antarctica/ships/luxury-expedition_4/clelia-ii_49.htm) is apparently another example of a ship’s engines being impacted by damage to electrical control systems.  The *[Clelia II](http://www.polarcruises.com/antarctica/ships/luxury-expedition_4/clelia-ii_49.htm)‘s* bridge was reported to be damaged by a large wave which broke the bridge windows and damaged the ship’s controls, cutting power to one engine.
