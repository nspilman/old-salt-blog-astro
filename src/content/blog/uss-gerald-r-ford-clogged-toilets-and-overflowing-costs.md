![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ussford.jpg)The US Navy’s newest aircraft carrier, [USS *Gerald R. Ford*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Gerald_R._Ford), is the largest aircraft carrier ever built and, at over $13 billion, is also the most expensive. Nevertheless, because of problems with [mission-critical systems](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/30626/top-navy-official-lashes-out-over-troubled-new-carrier-that-may-not-be-ready-until-2024-now), the ship has been referred to by one critic as nothing more than a “[nuclear-powered berthing barge](https://taskandpurpose.com/military-tech/navy-aircraft-carrier-maintenance-delays).” 

Unfortunately, a recent [GAO report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/705463.pdf) on unaccounted maintenance costs suggests that the *Ford* may not be so great as a berthing barge either. The problem? The toilets and the entire sewage system tends to get easily clogged. When this happens, the Navy has to flush the system with acid to clear it at a reported cost of $400,000. How often does this happen? The GAO says that the Navy cannot say.

From the report: *According to fleet maintenance officials, while each acid flush costs about $400,000, the Navy has yet to determine how often and for how many ships this action will need to be repeated, making the full cost impact difficult to quantify.*

The GAO uses the costly clogged sewage system as one example of “underestimated sustainment costs” contributing to a total of $130 billion of additional costs across six shipbuilding programs. 

This might be understandable if it was a new problem. The *Ford,* after all, is not expected to ready for her first deployment until 2022, or possibly 2024. The *Ford* is, however, not the first US carrier with these toilet problems.

Over 8 years ago, we [posted about similar toilet issues on the last Nimitz Class carrier](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/uss-george-hw-bush-new-6-billion-aircraft-carrier-without-working-toilets/), the [USS *George H.W. Bush*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_George_H.W._Bush). From our post of October 2011: Since it deployed in May, the new carrier has suffered from widespread plumbing failures, which, at times, rendered the entire ship without a single working head.   With remarkable understatement, the crew has complained that the lack of toilets has “affected their morale, health and job performance.”   The problem has been ongoing for six months. The Navy is blaming the sailors, who are blaming the design of the vacuum toilet system. 

So apparently, the sewage system problems on the [USS *George H.W. Bush* are now shared with the USS *Gerald R. Ford,*](https://www.businessinsider.com/unclogging-the-toilets-on-the-navys-newest-carriers-costs-400000-2020-3) and, no doubt, the follow-on ships of her class.
