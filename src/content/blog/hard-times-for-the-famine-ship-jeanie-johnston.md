![JeanieJohnston](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/03/JeanieJohnston.jpg)Here is a reminder just how difficult it is to fund, build, operate and maintain historic or replica ships.  Those who do so successfully, deserve more credit than they receive. The [Irish Examiner](http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/ailing-euro14m-replica-famine-ship-is-worth-just-euro150k-320769.html) recently described how the replica “famine ship” *[Jeanie Johnson](http://www.jeaniejohnston.ie/)* has fallen on hard times. The replica is described as “haemorrhaging money” and in dire need of repair.  The ship was intended to serve as a sail training ship and as a living history museum on 19th century emigration.  Because of her condition, she cannot leave the dock and she is not attracting significant numbers of visitors as a dockside attraction. Construction of the three masted barque originally cost Irish taxpayers  €14 million.

The original [*Jeanie Johnson*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_Johnston) was built in 1847, Quebec, Canada by the Scottish-born shipbuilder John Munn for Irish merchants John Donovan & Sons.  Between 1848 to 1855, the ship made 16 voyages between Tralee, Ireland and Quebec, Baltimore, and New York carrying immigrants fleeing the Irish Famine and its aftermath on the westbound leg and cargoes of timber on the eastbound return trip. Despite crowded conditions typical of ships of the time, no crew or passenger lives were ever lost on board the *Jeanie Johnston*.
