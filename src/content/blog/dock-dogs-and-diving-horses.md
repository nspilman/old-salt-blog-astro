Some new competitive sports are better than others. I am not sure how I feel about dock dogs competitions. Still it has to be an improvement over [diving horses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_horse) which were wildly popular in the US in the 1880s. Remarkably there is at least one diving horse still performing.  But first, from *Time* magazine: [DockDogs: The Sport Where Canines Catch Big Air](http://www.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,1141010501001_2093956,00.html)

  
**Diving Horses**

In 1881 William “Doc” Carver “invented” a sideshow attraction in which a horse would dive into a pool of water fron heights as high as sixty feet. Sometimes the horse would have a rider and sometimes the horse would dive alone. The 1991 Walt Disney movie, “[Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B8QG36/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B000B8QG36)“, is about a girl who rides a diving horse.

There is one diving horse still performing. The [diving horse “Lightning”](http://www.thedivinghorse.com/about-horse-diving.html) does summertime shows at the [Magic Fores](http://www.magicforestpark.com/)t, an amusement park for young children near Lake George, NY.
