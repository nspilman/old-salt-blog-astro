There is a wonderful article in today’s [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/sports/arctic-adventure-a-1500-mile-trip-by-sea-kayak.html?pagewanted=3&_r=1&hp) about [Jon Turk](http://jonturk.net/content/ellesmere) and [Erik Boomer](Erik Boomer), who recently became the first to circumnavigate Canada’s [Ellesmere Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellesmere_Island), roughly 1,000 miles north of the Arctic Circle.  Jon Turk, 65, is an author, scientist and veteran adventurer while Erik Boomer is a 26-year-old photographer and whitewater kayaker. Over 104 days, the pair trudged, skied and paddled the rugged and ice-bound 1,500-mile perimeter of the island.  In total, they paddled around 650 miles. Turk and Boomer have been nominated for National Geographic’s [Adventurers of the Year 2012](http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/adventurers-of-the-year/2012/jon-turk-erik-boomer/) award.

In addition to describing the trip, the article includes a number of useful life lessons:

*   *When a friendly Arctic wolf traipses into camp and wants to hang out, let him sleep where he pleases.*
*   *When a polar bear pokes his nose into the tent, scream to chase him out.*
*   *When visiting a place where the sun never sets, carry more sunscreen.*
*   *To stave off a breaching 3,000-pound walrus from the cockpit of a small sea kayak, use the paddle.  Hit him in the face and try to feed him the paddle. Then start paddling.*

All worth remembering*.*
