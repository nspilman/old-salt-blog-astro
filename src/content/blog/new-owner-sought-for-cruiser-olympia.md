![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/08/olympia2e.jpg)Yesterday the [Independence Seaport Museum](http://www.phillyseaport.org/) posted a “[NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY OF TRANSFER APPLICATION PROCESS FOR CRUISER, OLYMPIA](http://www.phillyseaport.org/olympia_transfer/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/press_release.pdf)” to formally begin the process of seeking a new owner for the historic cruiser launched in 1892.  From the notice:

*The Olympia, Admiral Dewey’s flagship and once the most celebrated, state-of-the art naval vessel afloat, will be scrapped or scuttled unless a new owner can be found. In terms of historic value, the National Historic Landmark Olympia has been equated to the USS Constitution and the Constellation as one of the most important vessels in U.S. Naval history. The ship straddles the shift between the age of sail and the age of steel, and marks the launch of the modern steel Navy. Deferred maintenance has reached a critical stage and the ship requires $2-5 million of immediate stabilization. A further estimated $10-20 million will be required for dry-dock and restoration.*
