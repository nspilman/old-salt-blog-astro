Earlier this month we posted that the [Friends of the Falls of Clyde](http://sites.google.com/a/friendsoffallsofclyde.org/test3/home) have been nominated to receive a grant from [Hampton Hotels “Save-A-Landmark” program](http://www.hamptonlandmarks.com/savealandmark.aspx).  The project which receives the most votes gets the funding. The voting will continue through the end of November.   Please vote now for the Falls of Clyde. [Click here to vote](http://www.hamptonlandmarks.com/VoteLandMarkResults.aspx?statename=Hawaii&state=70) . It costs nothing and could do a world of good.  The *Falls of Clyde* is truly a ship worth saving.
