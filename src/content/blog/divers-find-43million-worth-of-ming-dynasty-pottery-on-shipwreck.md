Divers have found a huge “haul” of Ming Dynasty pottery on a ship that sank off the coast of Indonesia in 1580. What I find amazing about the discovery are the photos of the pottery on the bottom, still in stacks and largely intact.  Recovering gold  or silver from a ship wreck is one thing.  Porcelain,  in a shipwreck underwater for over 400 years, is something else entirely.  The Ming dynasty porcelain is said to be worth approximately £43million.

*It is thought there could be 700,000 pieces of blue and white Chinese porcelain at a depth of 182m (600ft).*

*The collection was found by German maritime heritage group Arqueonautas Worldwide and partner RM Discovery.*

*‘The wreck was located in mid-2009 by fishermen and has become extremely vulnerable to plundering,’ said Nikolaus Graf Sandizell, of Arqueonautas.*
