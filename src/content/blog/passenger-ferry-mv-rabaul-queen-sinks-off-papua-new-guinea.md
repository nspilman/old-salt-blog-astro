MV Rabaul Queen at the port of Kimbe

Between 5 and 6 AM Thursday morning, the passenger ferry, [MV *Rabaul Queen*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Rabaul_Queen), capsized about 10 miles off Finschhafen on the northern coast of Papua New Guinea.  The ferry had a capacity for 300 people, but as many as 350 people are believed to have been aboard. More than 200 have now been pulled from the sea by rescuers. At least one hundred remaining unaccounted for. The ferry was sailing between the ports of Kimbe and Lae when it sent a distress call.  The cause of the sinking has not been determined but there were reports of strong northwesterly winds and sea swells of up to 5 meters.    The MV *Rabaul Queen* is reported to have been a 1983-built, 259 gross ton, Papua New Guinea-flagged passenger/ro-ro ferry operated by PNG’s Star Ships.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing on the news.
