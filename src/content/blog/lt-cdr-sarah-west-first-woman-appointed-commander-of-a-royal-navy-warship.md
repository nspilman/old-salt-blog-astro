*A Ministry of Defence spokesman said Lt Cdr West would complete a commanding officer designate course before taking up the position.*

*Women have been able to serve in the Royal Navy since 1994 and now make up just under 10% of the force.  They remain barred from some areas of service, such as the Royal Marine Commandos.   Lt Cdr West’s previous naval experience has included serving in the Gulf.*

*She grew up in Lincolnshire and studied maths at the University of Hertfordshire before joining Britannia Royal Naval College in 1995.*
