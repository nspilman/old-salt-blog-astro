![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rnsailorsgunc2.jpg)The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-62986002) recently reported on a young Royal Navy sailor, Able Seaman Hollie Randle, one of 142 sailors who pulled the gun carriage bearing Queen Elizabeth II’s coffin in the state funeral procession. Seaman Randle said that she was “overwhelmed” by the honor and that, “if someone had told me a year ago I’d be taking the Queen’s coffin to her funeral, I wouldn’t have believed them.”

For those of us on the other side of the pond, this raises the question, “Why use Royal Navy sailors, rather than horses, to draw the gun carriage carrying the coffin?” Apparently, the tradition originated with [Queen Victoria’s funeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_funeral_of_Queen_Victoria) on February 2, 1901.

When the procession carrying Queen Victoria’s coffin set off, the horses that were pulling it reared up. After the horses were led away, Royal Navy sailors standing guard nearby were called in to pull the coffin through Windsor. The tradition has continued at state funerals ever since.

The gun carriage itself was constructed at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, South East London, and was first used at the state funeral of Queen Victoria because she had requested she be buried as “a soldier’s daughter”.

[National World](https://www.nationalworld.com/news/uk/why-do-sailors-pull-the-queens-gun-carriage-royal-navy-role-queen-elizabeth-ii-funeral-3847793) reports that in all, 142 sailors from Royal Navy vessels and stations across the UK pull\[ed\] the state gun carriage through London as part of the funeral procession. Most of the group of sailors pull\[ed\] the ceremonial carriage from the front, with the remaining military personnel acting as its brakes. They have been drilled for the state funeral at HMS *Collingwood* in Fareham, Hampshire.
