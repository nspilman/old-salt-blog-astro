Once movies were based on great novels.  Of course, they usually ruined the story, but at least you could say, “I liked the book better.”   Then, seven years ago,  Jerry Bruckheimer produced a movie based on a [Disney World amusement ride](http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/magic-kingdom/attractions/pirates-of-the-caribbean/). The movie, [Pirates of the Caribbean](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JM5E?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00005JM5E), with a production budget of $140 million, was a huge hit, grossing over $650 million worldwide,  spawning two sequels, with one more on the way.   Now a major studio is investing $200 million on a movie based on the [Milton Bradley board game](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FVSZAK?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001FVSZAK), [Battleship](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440129/).  It will feature [Taylor Kitsch](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2018237/), pop star [Rihanna](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1982597/) and “supermodel” [Brooklyn Decker](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2395937/). This will be Rihanna’s first movie and Decker’s second.

Having moved from novels, to amusement park rides to board games, I wonder from whence the next inspiration for nautically themed movies will come.  I am considering pitching an idea based on something I found stuck to the bottom of my left sea boot.

In other nautical movie news, the pathetic box office of [Piranha 3-D](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464154/) this weekend has *Slate Magazine*‘s Daniel Engber wondering, [“Is 3-D Dead in the Water?”](http://www.slate.com/id/2264927/) If Piranha 3-D is the best they can manage, let’s hope so.
