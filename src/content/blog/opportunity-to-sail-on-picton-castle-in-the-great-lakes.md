![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/05/pictoncastle17.jpg)Just returning from its seventh round the world voyage, the barque [*Picton Castle*](https://www.picton-castle.com/voyages/the-voyages/great-lakes-2019.html) will set off again this summer bound for the Great Lakes to take part in the [Tall Ships America’s Tall Ships Challenge — Great Lakes 2019](http://Tall Ships America's Tall Ships Challenge -- Great Lakes).  The ship is seeking trainee crew. From their website:  

*You too can be part of this amazing voyage.  By signing up to join the Picton Castle as a trainee crew member, this can be your summer of sailing ship memories.  Sign aboard for as little as one week, two weeks, or for the full three-month voyage.  The longer the better, we always say.*

*No experience is necessary, the ship will take care of that, you just need good health, a good attitude and the desire to be part of the working crew of the ship.  With the guidance of the professional crew, you will steer the ship, stand watches, lay aloft or out on the bowsprit, and pitch in with ship’s maintenance: tarring the rig, painting, and varnishing, splicing new lines and whatever comes along.  All the while learning the ways of a square rigger at sea on these inland seas.*

[*Picton Castle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picton_Castle_\(ship\)) is a fully certified and registered Cook Islands registered tall ship whose mission is deep-ocean sail training and long-distance education voyages. Picton Castle is perhaps best known for her World Circumnavigations, though she has visited the Great Lakes twice, sailed numerous times on tours of the East Coast of the Americas, completed a Caribbean Voyage and in 2008 sailed to Europe, Africa and the Caribbean on a Voyage of the Atlantic. The ship operates with a paid crew of 12 and up to 40 trainees.
