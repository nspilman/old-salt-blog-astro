![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heaton.jpg)In recognition of his accomplishments and service, [Lt Cmdr Sean “Central” Heaton has been made an MBE](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/new-year-honours-list-royal-navy-bomb-mbe-b572354.html) (Most Excellent Order of the British Empire), in the New Year Honours list.

World War II had been over for more than 70 years, when in 2018, an unexploded 500-pound Luftwaffe bomb was found on the bottom of London’s King George V Docks – next to London City Airport. The discovery led to the cancellation of all flights to and from the airport, evacuation of more than 100 homes, and closure of the Channel Tunnel and other public services.

The bomb was safely disarmed by a team of Royal Navy experts led by Lt Cmdr Heaton, working side by side with civilian authorities and agencies over a three-day operation.

Under Lt Cmdr Heaton’s leadership, specialist divers from [Portsmouth](https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/portsmouth) and Plymouth-based bomb disposal units have rendered safe or disposed of nearly 16,000 potentially explosive items.

These included sea mines, torpedoes, hand grenades, mortars and bombs dropped by aircraft, as well as present-day improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

His citation says: “He relentlessly delivered very high-tempo operations, above and beyond that expected of his rank and his peers, with an admirable dedication to his people.

“His devotion, commitment, and professional ability have been extraordinary, and he most strongly deserves official recognition.”

Lt Cmdr Heaton said he is honored to have been singled out.

He added: “This decoration is as much a recognition of the brave, dedicated and immensely professional men and women that were under my command during my time in Southern Diving Group.”
