![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/turntableferry.jpg)I am sorry to say that we missed seeing this intriguing ferry, [MV *Glenachulish*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Glenachulish), when we visited Skye last September. (We went “over the sea to Skye” on the more conventional ferry from Mallaig to Armadale.) I had never heard of a turntable ferry before Dick Kooyman was kind enough to pass this short video from the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-scotland-65429882?xtor=ES-208-[60625_News_NLB_GET_WEEK18_02_May_2023]-20230502-[newsuk_scotland_ferry]) of the world’s last manually-operated turntable ferry. 

Its unique design allows it to navigate the challenging tidal conditions of the Kylerhea Narrows between the Scottish mainland and the Isle of Skye.  The 550-meter (600-yard) crossing takes five minutes and is the shortest sea crossing to Skye. The ferry runs seven days a week between Easter and October.

Up to six cars can be transported on the *Glenachulish*‘s deck, which the crew rotate by hand when it reaches its slipway.

*Glenachulish* was built at Ailsa Shipbuilding Company in Troon in 1969. She is named after Glenachulish, a glen and hamlet near South Ballachulish.

The ferry was saved in 2007 when it was bought by the local community after its long-term skipper retired.
