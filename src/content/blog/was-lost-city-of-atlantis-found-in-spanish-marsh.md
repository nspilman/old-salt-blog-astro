Researchers believe that they may have found the location of the lost city of Atlantis in a coastal Spanish marsh.   Plato described the legendary island-city in about 360 B.C. as having “in a single day and night … disappeared into the depths of the sea.”    The researchers believe that the ancient city was destroyed by tsunami. Whether or not their research holds up, destruction by a tsunami seems highly credible.  Their work is the subject of a National Geographic documentary – [Finding Atlantis](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/finding-atlantis-4982/Overview#tab-Overview).
