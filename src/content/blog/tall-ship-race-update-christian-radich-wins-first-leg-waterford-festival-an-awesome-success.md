The  [Tall  Ships Race 2011](http://www.sailtraininginternational.org/events/2011-onwards/2011-race)  is off to a great start.  The race was kicked off with a [festival in Waterford](http://www.waterfordtallshipsrace.ie/), Ireland,  which was declared [‘an awesome success’ by the chairman of Fáilte Ireland](http://www.waterford-today.ie/waterford-today-news/13332-waterford-s-hosting-of-the-tall-ships-races-declared-an-awesome-success-13332.html), the national tourism authority. ([See our previous post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/29/waterford-ireland-welcomes-the-tall-ship-racers-with-a-festival/).)  During the four day festival, an estimated 500,000 visited the ships and other festival events alongside the city quays or lining up on either side of the Suir Estuary to watch the Parade of Ships, which began the race last Sunday.

[The Norwegian tall ship *Christian Radich* has won the first leg of the race from Waterford to Greenock.](http://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/2011/07/08/christian-radich-with-shetland-trainees-on-board-wins-first-tall-ships-race)  Another ship participating in the race, [*Irene of Bridgwater*, was not so fortunate, running aground in Lamlash Bay](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-14056977).   There were no injuries reported and the ship has been refloated and is reported to be on her way to Greenock.  The tall ships depart on the next leg of the race on Tuesday.
