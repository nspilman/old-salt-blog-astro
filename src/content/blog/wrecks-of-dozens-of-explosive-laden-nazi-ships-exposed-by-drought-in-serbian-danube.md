![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/danubehulk.jpg)One of the worst droughts in European history has exposed a [graveyard of sunken German warships](https://news.yahoo.com/low-water-levels-danube-reveal-104852719.html) filled with explosives and ammunition in the Serbian section of the Danube River. More than 20 hulks have emerged near the port town of Prahovo, part of a Nazi Black Sea fleet that was sunk in 1944 while fleeing Soviet forces. More ships are expected to be found lodged in the river’s sandbanks, loaded with unexploded ordnance.

“The German flotilla has left behind a big ecological disaster that threatens us, people of Prahovo,” said Velimir Trajilovic, 74, a pensioner from Prahovo who wrote a book about the German ships.

By Prahovo, some of the hulks have narrowed the navigable section on this stretch of the Danube to just 100 meters (330 feet) from 180 meters.

Strewn across the riverbed, some of the ships still boast turrets, command bridges, broken masts and twisted hulls, while others lie mostly submerged under sand banks.

In March, the Serbian government invited a tender for the salvage of the hulks and removal of ammunition and explosives. The cost of the operation was estimated at 29 million euros ($30 million).
