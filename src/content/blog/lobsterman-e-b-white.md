When I think of [E.B. White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._B._White) I think of the classic children’s books, *Stuart Little*, *Charlotte’s Web*, and *The Trumpet of the Swan*, among others. He was also the co-author of the English language style guide *The Elements of Style*.

E.B. White was also a sailor. His adopted home was in Brooklin, Maine, where he lived for almost 50 years. His son, [Joel White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_White), was a naval architect and boat builder, who owned Brooklin Boat Yard.  Here is a video, *[Lobsterman](https://vimeo.com/105432077)*, written and narrated by E.B. White from the PBS show *[Omnibus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_\(U.S._TV_series\))*.
