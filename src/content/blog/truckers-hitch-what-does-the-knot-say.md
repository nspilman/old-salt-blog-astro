You may recall the Norwegian comedy team [Ylvis](http://www.ylvis.com/) from their viral hit, “[What Does the Fox Say?](https://youtu.be/jofNR_WkoCE),” which was viewed more than a half billion times on Youtube. One of their more recent music videos, released in September, is on knot tying, specifically, the [Trucker’s Hitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trucker%27s_hitch). The Trucker’s Hitch also known as a Power Cinch Knot is useful for securing a dinghy to the deck as well as having a number of other uses. Now, thanks to Ylvis, it is also a dance move. While their video is a lot of fun, if you actually want to learn how to tie a trucker’s hitch check out the video from the good folks at [Animated Knots by Grog](http://www.animatedknots.com/truckers/), after the page break.
