Bruce Ismay, chairman of J P Morgan’s International Mercantile Marine Company, which owned the White Star Line and the Titanic.  Ismay’s life would have been far less complicated, albeit much much shorter, if he had chosen not to jump into the lifeboat.

*A wily, astute writer, Wilson places at the heart of her story a simultaneously small and momentous act: Ismay’s “jump” into a lifeboat. Vilified as a coward, he would later refuse either to apologise or to explain, repeating blandly that “the boat was there” and “the deck was empty”. Yet this one act became a fulcrum for his whole life story. When he stepped quietly into Collapsible C, Ismay entered a looking-glass world.*

Willson apparently goes on to draw parallels between Ismay and Conrad’s tragic character “Lord Jim.”  Without having read the book this appears to be a considerable stretch. We will be reviewing the book on its release in October.
