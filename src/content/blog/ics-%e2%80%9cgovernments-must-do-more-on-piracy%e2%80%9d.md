*The unacceptable situation prevailing now, with seafarers lives being threatened on a daily basis – and Somali pirates still operating with impunity – cannot be allowed to continue.*

*It is particularly upsetting when the main focus of some senior politicians is limited to commenting on their objections to the payment of ransoms. But given the inability of the international community to intervene in Somalia, the shipowner currently has little alternative when confronted with seafarers being held hostage.”*  
  
*While the level of co-ordination amongst military forces providing protection to shipping is extremely good, it falls short of what could be achieved under a single unitary command structure. At present ships operate under different ‘rules of engagement’, which prevents a consistent response to pirates when they are caught in the act. United Nations Resolutions, which reiterate governments’ authority to act, are being interpreted differently by the various nations that have warships in the area.*

*All too often, small boats or skiffs that have conducted aborted attacks are allowed to proceed back to Somalia without military intervention. This gives the message that the military will not see hot pursuit operations through to their natural conclusion. Similarly, intercepted pirates are often released only to return to Somalia without being arrested and prosecuted. A more consistent and robust approach to enforcement is required.”*

*In cases where attacks occur hundreds of miles off the Somali coast then the skiffs must have been deployed from mother ships,” ICS says. “The skiffs simply do not have the endurance for operations deep into the Indian Ocean. Why are the ‘mother ships’ not being intercepted and detained?*
