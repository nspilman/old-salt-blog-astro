![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/05/superflowerbloodmoon.jpg)Skywatchers in portions of the Americas, Antarctica, Europe, Africa, and the East Pacific will see a [Super Flower Blood Moon total lunar eclipse](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2022/05/11/blood-moon-7-weird-things-you-need-to-know-about-north-americas-84-minute-prime-time-total-lunar-eclipse-this-weekend/?sh=64747a63332c) this Sunday night and into Monday morning, weather permitting. May’s full moon is traditionally called the Flower Moon since this is the time of year when flowers bloom in abundance.

On the US East coast, observers can expect to start seeing the lunar eclipse at 10:27 p.m. and will be able to see the total eclipse at 11:29 p.m. for 84 minutes, according to NASA. While the full moon is wholly in the Earth’s shadow, enough light will escape around the globe to turn the moon a deep reddish hue, thus earning the nickname “blood moon.”

The eclipse ends just before 2 a.m. ET Monday morning.

On Sunday night, the moon will also be at perigee (its closest to Earth of the month), making it a Super Blood Moon eclipse. 

Unfortunately for those of us in the Northeast of the US, the current forecast is for overcast skies on Sunday night. If you want to see a total lunar eclipse and the heavens do not cooperate, there will be a second total lunar eclipse this year on November 7-8, 2022.
