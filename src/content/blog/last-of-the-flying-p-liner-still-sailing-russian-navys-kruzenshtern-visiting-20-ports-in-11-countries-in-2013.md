![KflyingP](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/12/KflyingP.jpg)For a handful of ships, the great age of sail has not yet ended.  In 2013, the Russian Navy sail training ship [*Kruzenshtern*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruzenshtern_\(ship\)) will call in 20 seaports in 11 countries and will take part in several international regattas. The ship, originally built in 1926 in Bremerhaven, Germany as the *Padua* is one of four surviving [Laeisz Flying P liners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner) and the last actively sailing.  The *Kruzenshtern,* a four masted barque, is the second oldest windjammer still actively sailing, second only to the Russian sail training ship [*Sedov*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedov), built in 1921 as the *Magdalene Vinnen II*.
