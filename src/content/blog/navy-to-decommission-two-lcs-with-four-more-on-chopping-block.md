USS Little Rock

We posted back in February, about the [Navy’s plans to decommission four relatively new Littoral Combat Ships (LCS)](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/02/navy-wants-to-retire-first-four-still-almost-new-littoral-combat-ships/). Congress granted approval to decommission two, the USS *Independence* and the USS *Freedom.* The *Independence* was decommissioned on July 29, 20201 and the *Freedom* is slated to be decommissioned on September 30, 2021. The ships are 11 and 13 years old, respectively. 

The two ships were the first LCS built of two variant classes. The Freedom*\-class* ships are 388′ long monohulls, while the Independence-class ships are 418′ long trimarans.

In its new budget proposal, the Navy wants to decommission an additional four LCS — USS *Fort Worth,* USS *Coronado,* USS *Detroit,* and USS *Little Rock.* The last two ships, both Freedom-class, were only commissioned in 2016 and 2017, respectively. 

The [decision to decommission four and five-year-old ships](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41495/this-is-the-navys-timeline-for-ridding-itself-of-four-more-littoral-combat-ships) was attributed to “major propulsion train casualties.” Earlier this year, the Navy acknowledged that key propulsion machinery, the combining gear that links the gas turbines and diesel engines together on the Freedom-class ships, suffers from a class-wide “[latent engineering defect](https://news.usni.org/2021/01/19/navy-calls-freedom-lcs-propulsion-problem-class-wide-defect-wont-take-new-ships-until-fixed),” that resulted in the failures in the USS *Detroit,* and USS *Little Rock.* 

The Navy will be [testing a class gear fix](https://news.usni.org/2021/08/02/navy-will-test-freedom-class-lcs-gear-fix-next-month-years-before-repair-reaches-rest-of-fleet) in September. Even if all goes well, it is expected to be several years before the repairs reach the rest of the fleet.

[There are currently 10 Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ships](https://taskandpurpose.com/military-tech/navy-littoral-combat-ship-propulsion-problem/) in service in the Navy fleet, with an additional seven hulls still under construction, according to the service’s fiscal year 2021 budget request. Each vessel costs around $520 million, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report on the line.
