*High waters and flood damage have hampered navigation along the State Canal system. The Erie Canal remains closed to navigation between Lock 2 in Waterford and Lock 19 in Frankfort, Montgomery County. The entire Champlain Canal is closed. There is no indication when the canals will re-open.*

Thanks to Ulrich Rudofsky for the heads up.
