![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dmitrii-Donskoi.jpg)In July of last year, [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/07/gold-the-wreck-of-the-russian-cruiser-dmitrii-donskoi-real-or-hype/) about a Korean maritime salvage company which claimed to have found the wreck of the Russian armored cruiser, [*Dmitrii Donskoi*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cruiser_Dmitrii_Donskoi) which sank during the 1905 Battle of Tsushima. They also claimed that the wreck might contain gold worth around $133.4 billion. The claims of gold seemed doubtful to many, including us, but generated enough excitement for the group backing the salvors to raise $7.6 million from investors.  

Within about a month, it began to appear the Shinil Group, the group behind the project, was involved in some sort of [cryptocurrency scheme](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/08/claims-of-vast-treasure-on-dmitrii-donskoi-wreck-a-likely-cryptocurrency-scam/).  From there the scam fell completely apart. Last week, [three executives from the company were convicted of fraud](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/02/asia/south-korea-gold-ship-jail-intl/index.html) by the Seoul Southern District Court, receiving sentences of five years, four and two years respectively.
