Our condolences to his family and all those who cared for him.

Bert’s seafaring career began in 1978 when he joined the brigantine *Romance* on which he sailed for almost three years and circumnavigated the globe. He would go on to serve as bos’n, rigger, mate, and captain aboard many future sailing school vessels including *Regina Maris*, *Sea Cloud*, *Elizabeth II*, *Mayflower II*, *Lindo/Alexandria* and the *Spirit of Massachusetts*. 

In October of 2017, Captain Bert Rogers received the National Maritime Historical Society’s Distinguished Service Award. The video below, narrated by Captain Rogers, touches on his career and his vision for the tall ships community.
