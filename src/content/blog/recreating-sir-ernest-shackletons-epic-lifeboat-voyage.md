In 1916, [Ernest Shackleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton) and five sailors set off on an 1300 kilometer voyage to South Georgia Island, across some of roughest waters in the world, in the *[James Caird](http://www.jamescairdsociety.com/),* a 6.9 meter lifeboat, in a desperate attempt to reach help and to arrange the rescue of the twenty two men left behind on Elephant Island.  Now, the [Shackleton Epic Expedition](http://www.jamescairdsociety.com/shackleton-news.php?id=106085) led by [Tim Jarvis](http://www.timjarvis.org/shackletonepic/) has constructed a replica of the *James Caird,* named the *Alexandra Shackleton,* in honor of the explorer’s granddaughter.   The expedition will attempt to recreate Shackleton’s truly epic voyage later this year.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://alaricbond.com/) for passing along the news.
