![450px-Crown_Princess](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/11/450px-Crown_Princess.jpg)A month long Pacific cruise on the Princess Cruise Line [*Crown Princess*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Princess_\(ship\)) has been disrupted by a norovirus outbreak.  158 of 3,009 passengers were sickened by highly contagious stomach virus, while 14 of 1,160 crew members were affected.  [The ship will return to the port of San Pedro Sunday.](http://6abc.com/news/cdc-172-people-on-cruise-fell-ill-with-norovirus/397668/) It set off from Papeete, Tahiti to Los Angeles on Oct. 18.

The outbreak on the *Crown Princess* pales compared to the 700 person outbreak on RCCL’s [*Explorer of the Seas* last January in which more than 20% of the passengers](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/01/rccls-explorer-of-the-seas-sets-new-record-for-contagion-with-almost-700-ill/) were stricken.
