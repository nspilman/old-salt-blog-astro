[![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/01/bremen1wide.jpg)](http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2012/01/salvaging-the-tk-bremen/100231/)[We posted last December](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/16/cargo-ship-tk-bremen-blown-ashore-on-kerminihy-beach-in-southern-brittany-leaking-oil/) about the Maltese flagged 6,600 DWT dry cargo ship, *[TK Bremen](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=248270000)*, which was stranded in high winds on Kerminihy beach at Erdeven, in southern Brittany, near the port of Lorient, France.  Now a bit over a month later she has been “salvaged,” in the sense that she has been removed form the beach, if not in the sense of being “saved.”  Sometimes the only choice available to a salvor, when the ship cannot be removed intact, is to to scrap her in place and a haul away the cut up steel.

The [Atlantic Monthly](http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2012/01/salvaging-the-tk-bremen/100231/) has a wonderful series of 29 photographs documenting the ship on the beach, the clean up and removal of oil, and the ripping apart of the ship by mechanical monsters (OK, crawler cranes with hydraulic shears.) We have posted thumbnails of four of the images above. Click on the images or the link below to see all 29 photos.
