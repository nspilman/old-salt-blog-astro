In 1606, the [*Duyfken*](http://www.duyfken.com/original/), commanded by  Willem Janszoon, became the first European vessel to sail to the continent of Australia.    In 1999, in an act of “[experimental archaeology](http://www.duyfken.com/replica/experimental.html),” a replica of of the Dutch ship was built in Freemantle, Australia. The goal was to build a replica that approached the remarkable sailing qualities of the original ship.  The effort was a success.  Now over 400 years after the original first sailed the shallow seas of the East Indies, the [*Duyfken*](http://www.duyfken.com/) replica continues its legacy.  Recently three short videos were posted of the  *Duyfken* sailing in the Arafura Sea between Australia and New Guinea.  Thanks to [Margaret Muir](http://www.margaretmuirauthor.com/) for pointing them out.
