Scientists have observed, in two different locations off the Hawaiian islands, humpback whales giving dolphins “rides” on their heads. A dolphin will swim up over the top of the humpback whale’s head. The humpback will then gently lift its head allowing the dolphin to slide down its back. In one encounter the dolphin and the whale repeated the “ride” six times in succession. The actions of both dolphins and whales appeared to be slow and gentle showing no signs of aggression. They appeared to be involved in inter-species play, which is extremely rare in the natural world.  Thanks to Wojtek ‘Voytec’ Wacowski for pointing it out on Facebook.
