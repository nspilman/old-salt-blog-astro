Pirates are [reported to have seized the captain and chief engineer](http://gcaptain.com/nigerian-offshore-security-personnel/) from the US Flag offshore supply vessel, [*C-Retriever*](http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=731071), which was attacked in the Gulf of Guinea off the coast of Nigeria early Wednesday.  Both the captain and chief engineer are US citizens.

*“We are closely monitoring reports that two U.S. citizens have been kidnapped from a U.S.-flagged vessel, the C-Retriever, in the Gulf of Guinea,” a State Department official told [NBC News](http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/24/21114805-pirates-seize-two-americans-off-nigerias-coast?lite). “We are seeking additional information about the incident.”*  Thanks to Phil Leon for contributing to the post.
