![rcb1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/01/rcb1.jpg)Yesterday, two US Navy Riverine Command Boats (RCBs) with a combined crew of ten sailors were apprehended by Iranian Revolutionary Guard boats. One or both of the RCBs had suffered a mechanical failure and had drifted into Iranian waters. [The Iranians released the two boats and the sailors](http://news.yahoo.com/irans-revolutionary-guards-confirm-seizing-two-us-boats-004053071.html), nine men and one woman, today.  The incident raised one question, at least in my mind, “what is a Riverine Command Boat?”

The Riverine Command Boat (RCB) is a design based on the [Swedish Combat Boat 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB90-class_fast_assault_craft). It is a highly maneuverable water-jet powered shallow-draft vessel that can operate at speeds of up to 40 knots. The design has been adopted by navies around the world.  The Swedish Navy has 150 of the boats in service while Mexico has 48, Norway 20 and Malaysia 12, the US 6 and the UK 4.

The US Navy version of the RCB is built by [Safe Boat International](http://www.safeboats.com/programs/us-navy-boats/).  A video of two RCBs in the Arabian/Persian Gulf:
