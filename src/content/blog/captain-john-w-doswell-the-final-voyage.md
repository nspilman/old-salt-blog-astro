![john-on-ship-headpic](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/john-on-ship-headpic.jpg)On Friday, New York lost an essential part of its waterfront when Captain John W. Doswell died after a long illness. John was a pioneer in multimedia presentations. He was a writer, designer, producer and programmer. He was also a Navy veteran who served in Vietnam as well as an experienced sailor. He was a loving father and husband. He will probably be best remembered, however, for his impact on the waterfront community.

He was the Founding Chair of [Friends of Hudson River Park](http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/about-us/fohrp) and was involved with the passage of the Hudson River Park Act, which led to the formation of the Hudson River Park Trust, a city/state agency charged with building the park. He served on the board of the [North River Historic Ship Society](http://www.nrhss.org/) and [Save Our Ships NY](http://www.waterfrontalliance.org/partners/save-our-ships-new-york), and was a founding board member of the [Governors Island Alliance](http://www.governorsislandalliance.org/). He also was the Executive Director of the [Working Harbor Committee](http://workingharbor.com/) which sponsors the Hidden Harbor Tours, educating people about the working harbor of NY/NJ.  At John’s wedding to his life-partner, Jean Preece, in July, [Huntley Gill, architectural preservation specialist said of the two,](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/fashion/weddings/a-voyage-that-is-finally-complete.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A10%22%7D) “*John and Jean are the most important people in New York in terms of preserving the waterfront.  They are the people who get things done…*”

John’s wife, Jean made the following statement:

**JOHN W. DOSWELL**

A star has fallen from the sky – a very bright star. John W. Doswell passed away peacefully Friday evening, January 2nd, surrounded by his family. He graced us with his knowledge, wisdom, leadership, and calm loving temperament. The ships of the harbor will sail on because of his influence, but we are immeasurably saddened by this great loss.

To every sailor comes time to drop anchor.  
Haul in the sails, and make the lines fast.  
You deep-water dreamer, your journey is over  
You’re safe in the harbor at last.  
You’re safe in the harbor at last.

*Safe in the Harbor, Eric Bogle*

John’s wife, Jean, and their daughter, Jhoneen, are hosting ‘Reflection Gatherings’ on Tues-Wed-Thurs, the 6th, 7th, and 8th, from 2:00 pm to 9:00‎ pm each day. They would like John’s friends to stop by and share memories and stories at Doswell Productions, 455 West 43rd St, NY, NY.
