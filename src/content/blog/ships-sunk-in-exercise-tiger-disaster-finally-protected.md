![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exercisetiger.jpg)Two [Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Ship,_Tank) sunk in a disastrous rehearsal of the D-Day landing, have been granted [protected status by the government of Great Britain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/wrecks-of-us-vessels-from-d-day-rehearsal-given-protected-status). At least 749 US sailors and soldiers died when the ships were attacked by [German E-boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-boat), fast patrol torpedo boats, in late April of 1944, on the coast of Devon. 

“[Exercise Tiger](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Exercise-Tiger/)” was the largest of several “rehearsal” landings made on UK beaches prior to the actual landings on D-Day in June 1944. Slapton Sands off Devon was selected as a site as it resembled part of the French Normandy coast chosen for the landings. “Exercise Tiger” was intended as a realistic rehearsal for the landings on [Utah Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Beach) by American forces.

The exercise began on April 22nd and would last through the 30th, as landing craft loaded with soldiers, tanks, and equipment were deployed along the coast. Royal Navy destroyers, corvettes, and trawlers also joined in. In all, [221 vessels formed up in and around Lyme Bay](https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/wars-conflicts-and-operations/world-war-ii/1944/exercise-tiger.html), on the south coast of England. Only two escorts were assigned to defend the landing craft and, as one was disabled early in the exercise, only one escort was ultimately available.  

The rehearsal proved to be a disaster. Due to miscommunication about the time the attack, soldiers in landing craft would be tragically killed by ‘friendly fire’ from the supporting naval bombardment during the landing. 

Things would only get worse. Under the cover of darkness on the 27th, nine German E boats slipped into the flotilla and attacked with guns and torpedoes. LST-507 was hit by a torpedo in the auxiliary engine room. The resulting fire spread to the parking deck igniting the full gas tanks of trucks, tanks, jeeps, and landing vehicles. Ammunition also caught fire or exploded. 

The American troops and sailors had not been adequately trained in donning life jackets or abandoning the LST, which had become a raging inferno. Some sailors jumped overboard and drowned while still wearing heaving packs. Others were trapped by the flames.

A short time later, LST-531 was hit by two torpedos and sank in ten minutes. LST-289 was also struck by a torpedo but managed to reach shallow water to avoid sinking. A fourth LST was also damaged.

At least 749 US servicemen died. The terrible loss of life during the exercise was covered up and not revealed until long after the war. 

Now, seventy-six years after they were lost, LST-507 and LST-531 have been given legal scheduled status, the same designation given to monuments including Stonehenge, at the recommendation of Historic England.
