![stcyruslardsnh](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/stcyruslardsnh.jpg)Recent winter storms have washed ashore four large, barrel-shaped pieces of lard onto the beach at St.Cyrus nature reserve in Scotland.  They are believed to be from the wreck of a merchant vessel that was bombed in WW II.  Therese Alampo, St Cyrus reserve manager, said, “*The depth of the swell during the storms we had over the holidays must have broke apart the shipwreck some more and caused the lard to escape….**The lard was covered in the largest barnacles I’ve ever seen. Animals, including my dog, have certainly enjoyed the lard, and it still looks and smells good enough to have a fry up with.*”  Personally, I would prefer to avoid “fry ups” with barnacle covered lard, but perhaps I am being too picky.  Thanks to Niall Sinclair for passing the news along.
