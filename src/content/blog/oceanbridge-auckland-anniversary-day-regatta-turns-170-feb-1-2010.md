[Oceanbridge Auckland Anniversary Day Regatta turns 170, Feb 1, 2010](http://www.sail-world.com/USA/Oceanbridge-Auckland-Anniversary-Day-Regatta-turns-170,--Feb-1,--2010/63987)

*On Monday, 1 February 2010, New Zealand’s oldest sporting event, the Auckland Anniversary Day Regatta will celebrate its 170th anniversary with a celebration of our maritime history and heritage on land and sea with a fleet of sail boats, classic yachts, tugboats and tall ship as well as two Australian contenders.*  
  
*‘The Regatta is synonymous with Auckland’s celebration of its birthday and embraces all classes of sail boats including classic yachts and tugboats and all classes of sailors,’ says Organising Committee Chairman, Eric Mahoney. ‘Anniversary Day regattas have been a training ground for many of the current world champions, Olympic and America’s Cup yachties and there will be a full fleet of some of our fastest and most innovative craft racing.*

*‘The regatta will also provide a rare opportunity to witness the revival of some of our great classic yachts and workboats which have been beautifully restored to their original glory using the skills of local maritime historians and the Traditional Boatbuilding School at Hobsonville.’*
