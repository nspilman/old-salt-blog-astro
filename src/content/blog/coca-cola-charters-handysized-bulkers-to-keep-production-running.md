![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cocacolabulk.jpg)We recently posted about [Home Depot and Costco independently chartering containerships](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/09/port-congestion-spreads-to-east-coast-major-shippers-charter-ships-independently/) to address ship and port congestion problems. Now, Coca-Cola is taking another approach to fix its broken supply chains.

[Splash247.com](https://splash247.com/its-the-real-thing-coke-sources-handy-bulkers-as-container-choices-run-dry/) reports that Coca-Cola becomes the latest global mega-brand to decide to switch from regular liner choices for crucial deliveries, instead opting to move just over 60,000 tonnes of material on three handysize bulk carriers to keep its production lines running across the world.

The decision to go for bulk carriers rather than containerships was revealed via Coca-Cola’s procurement director, Alan Smith, on LinkedIn on Friday.

“When you cant get containers or space due to the current ocean freight crisis, then we had to think outside the box,” he wrote in an update on the social media platform.

The material shifted in sacks is the equivalent of 2,800 teu. Smith revealed the bulker shift was the first of many planned over the coming months, the latest chapter in what Steve Ferreira, CEO of New York-based shipper advisory Ocean Audit, has described as “containergeddon” – this year’s extreme shortage of boxships and empty containers.

Coke’s logistics boss went on to reveal that the three bulk carriers – namely Empire Bulkers’ 34,399 dwt *Aphrodite M*, AM Nomikos’ 35,009 dwt *Weco Lucilia C*, and Zhejiang Shipping’s 35,130 dwt *Zhe Hai 505* – will head to non-congested ports, adding: “\[W\]e are hoping for a smooth discharge but it is a big watch out when chartering as the D&D per day is mega.”
