![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ear_175.jpg)One of the wonderful and maddening things about the internet is that we all make so many virtual acquaintances;  many who become good friends, and yet who we have met only through the ether of web pages and email.   It was, therefore, a real pleasure last Friday evening to sit down, in the flesh, and share a drink or two or – well perhaps, it is best not to specify the specific numbers of drinks – with a group of water bloggers from in and around New York.   In no particular order, there was Will van Dorp of the [Tugster](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2011/02/12/waterbloggers-3/) blog,  Christina 0f [Bowsprite](http://bowsprite.wordpress.com/), Bonnie of [Frogma](http://frogma.blogspot.com/) with TQ,  John and Vicky of  [Summit to Shore](http://www.summittoshore.blogspot.com/), Michael Alex of [Peconic Puffin](http://www.peconicpuffin.com/the_peconic_puffin/2011/02/compensatory-avocado-invisible-tugster-and-other-mysteries-from-waterblogfest-iii.html), and Adam of [Messing Around in Boats](http://messingaboutinboats.typepad.com/),  as well as Carolina from [Portside New York](http://www.portsidenewyork.org/index.htm).  An illustrious and/or nefarious group, to be sure.   Peconic Puffin summed up the evening thusly, *“The gathering of so many water bloggers in an ancient watering hole created a metafactual vortex that left me adrift in uncertainty and doubt.   But it was a  fun uncertainty and doubt!”* I have no idea what that means exactly, but it works for me.  
  
The assemblage was held at one of New York’s remaining classic waterfront “dive bars,”  the [Ear Inn](http://earinn.com/).  The owners claim that it is the “oldest working bar in New York City,” (a [claim shared by other city watering holes](http://nymag.com/nymetro/nightlife/barbuzz/11924/).)  The structure is one of the few remaining  Federal houses left in the city.  It was built for James Brown, a black aide to General Washington, who after the war prospered as a tobacco trader.  In the intervening years, the house has been a boarding house, a  brothel, a speakeasy, a restaurant and a bar.   An upper floor is said to be haunted by a sailor named, Mickie, waiting for a clipper ship to arrive in the harbor.
