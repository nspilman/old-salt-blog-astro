![bubbleb](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/10/bubbleb.jpg)You really can’t make this stuff up. Extreme runner, Reza Baluchi, attempted to run from Florida to Bermuda, a distance of roughly 1,000 miles, in an inflatable bubble with a metal frame, looking something like a giant hamster wheel.  It didn’t go well.  A few days into the attempt, Baluchi activated a personal locator beacon after becoming disoriented and exhausted. The Coast Guard responded. A chopper lowered a rescue swimmer into the water and found Baluchi lying down inside his bubble.  The rescue is estimated to have cost taxpayers roughly $144,000.

Now, Baluchi is claiming that he never wanted to be rescued and that he wants his bubble back. Apparently the bubble destroyed when a fishing boat attempted to tow it into port. Baluchi claims that “[the transponder button was struck accidentally](https://www.facebook.com/204736387173/photos/a.229560422173.167197.204736387173/10152776595977174/?type=1).” The Coast Guard has a somewhat different view.  Coast Guard spokesman, Petty Officer Mark Barney, noted, “*He activated both his spot beacon and personal locating beacon. That’s a distress call. When he activated those two things, he was calling for help.*”
