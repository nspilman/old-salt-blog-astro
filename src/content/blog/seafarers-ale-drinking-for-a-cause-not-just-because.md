![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/2610.jpg)For those in Britain, [Fuller’s Brewery](http://www.fullers.co.uk/) (Fuller, Smith and Turner plc), founded in 1864 and London’s only remaining traditional family brewer, is donating £5 to [Seafarers UK](http://www.seafarers-uk.org/) for every barrel of their [Seafarer’s Ale](http://www.fullers.co.uk/rte.asp?id=140) sold.  Seafarers UK is a national charity that supports seafarers and their families.  So now, stopping in at the pub for a pint can be a way of supporting a good cause, rather than just because…

I don’t believe that Seafarer’s Ale is available on this side of the pond.  I did however stop in at my local liquor store and picked up a six pack of [Fuller’s London Pride](http://www.fullers-ales.com/london_pride.php) to show my solidarity. (It is also an excellent ale.)
