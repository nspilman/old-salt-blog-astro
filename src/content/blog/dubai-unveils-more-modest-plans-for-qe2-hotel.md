![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/QueenElizabeth2Dubai.jpg)For several years now cruise ships fans have been concerned that the 2008 debt crunch in Dubai would result in the [RMS *Queen Elizabeth 2*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Queen_Elizabeth_2) being sold for scrap instead of being converted to a luxury hotel, as had been the plan when she was purchased  by Dubai investment company [Istithmar](http://istithmarworld.com/) for $100 million.  On Monday, it was announced that the ship would be converted to a more modest 300 room hotel.  Originally a 1,000 room facility had been planned. The ship will also not be moored at [Nakheel’s Palm Jumeirah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Jumeirah), the emirate’s famous palm-shaped island, but instead would be tied up  at the Port Rashid cruise terminal in a commercial district a considerable distance from the more tourist-friendly neighbourhoods.  For classic cruise ship fans, the good news is that large portion of the ship will remain unrenovated.

*“Unfortunately we had many ambitious plans but they didn’t work,” said Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chairman of Istithmar – the unit that bought the vessel for $100 million in 2007 – and the chairman of port operator DP World.*

*“What we are doing now we should have done when we got it,” he said.*

*The common areas, like the restaurants and entertainment areas, would be largely left as they are, he added.*

*The QE2 ocean liner is currently moored in Port Rashid in Dubai – a gritty commercial port a long way from the tourist-friendly neighbourhood of Palm Jumeirah – and will stay where she is, said Sulayem.*

*“There have been many grand ideas. There were plans of renovating it in such a way that it becomes something totally different than what it used to be. But we realized soon that a lot of people like the ship as it was,” he said.*
