Julien Berthier is  a sculptor and a conceptual artist.  His work titled “[Love, Love](http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/10/view/11980/julien-berthier-love-love.html)” is not in fact a sinking sailboat, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.   Bertheir started with a 6.5 meter yacht which he cut in half and added a new keel to allow the boat to remain upright while appearing to be sinking. The modified vessel/sculpture also has a motor, so it can move around, no doubt startling everyone everywhere it goes.   There is a photograph of “Love, Love” out of the water as well as a video of the craft  after the jump.
