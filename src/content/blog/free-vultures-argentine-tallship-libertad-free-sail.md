![libertadbanner1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/libertadbanner1.jpg)After being tied to the dock for several years, the [ARA *Libertad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_Libertad_\(Q-2\)), the Argentine Navy’s training ship, is sailing again. For the last three years, the ship has been entangled in a more than decade long battle over Argentine debt related to a financial crisis in 2002. In early March, [Argentina settled the dispute](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/20/argentina-signs-seals-and-delivers-1b-bond-deal-on-loose-leaf.html) with its remaining creditors, including several US hedge fund “vulture” capitalists, and shortly thereafter, ARA *Libertad* was made ready for sea. On June 3-7, she sailed to the US to participate in [Sail Baltimore](http://baltimore.org/events/sail-baltimore-presents-ara-libertad-tall-ship). She then sailed for Norfolk where she was one of the featured attractions at [Norfolk Harborfest](https://festevents.org/events/2016-season-events/norfolkharborfest40/) from June 9-12.  Last week ARA *Libertad* was at Pier 86 in New York before sailing for Amsterdam on Saturday.

The Argentine Ministry of Defense has also put up a [new web site](http://www.fragatalibertad.mindef.gob.ar/) with information about the ship and its itinerary. The site also featurs a 360 degree virtual tour.

In October 2012, [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/10/us-hedge-fund-billionaire-seizes-argentine-navy-tall-ship-libertad-in-ghana-over-debt-dispute/) about how the [*Libertad*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_Libertad_\(Q-2\)) and her crew of over 200, while docked in port of Tema, Ghana, were seized by a court order obtained by NML Capital Ltd., a subsidiary of Elliot Capital Management, a hedge fund run by the [US billionaire vulture capitalist Paul Singer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Singer_\(businessman\)). In December 2012, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled that [Ghana’s detention of the ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/12/un-court-orders-ara-libertad-released-from-ghana/) was in violation of international law and the ship was released.

Singer and other “vulture” fund operators buy sovereign debt at a deep discount and then demand full payment, often seizing assets owned by the country if they are not paid. Before attempting to seize the *Libertad*, Singer’s group in 2007 tried to get a court order to detain the [Tango 01, the Argentine presidential airplane](http://powerbase.info/index.php/Paul_Singer), and to seize fuel money from the aircraft’s pilots.

In the recent debt deal, it has been reported that [Singer’s fund netted $2.4 billion](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/3/4/headlines/argentina_pays_paul_singer_s_vulture_fund_24_billion)—10 to 15 times its original investment.
