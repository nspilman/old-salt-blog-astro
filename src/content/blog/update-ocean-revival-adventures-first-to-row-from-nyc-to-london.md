![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/atlanticrevival.jpg)Congratulations to the [Ocean Revival Adventures](https://oceanrevivaladventures.com/) team who have become the first to row from New York to London. The team of four serving and former serving Royal Marine Commandos completed the epic 72-day, 3,700-mile row across the North Atlantic from the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City to Tower Bridge in London. 

In May, I was fortunate enough to meet [Ian Clinton and Simon Chalk](https://oceanrevivaladventures.com/the-crew/), members of the Ocean Revival Adventures crew, waiting with their ocean rowing boats at Liberty Landing in New York harbor for a suitable weather window to set off on what has been dubbed the “world’s most dangerous row.” [See our previous post.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/05/ocean-revival-adventures-the-worlds-most-dangerous-row/)

Team comments from their [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/oceanrevival2020/):

*This has been without doubt the hardest thing we have ever undertaken and has been a real test of resilience. We have battled through some ferocious weather systems, huge ocean swells and endured everything that Mother Nature could throw at us.*

We have found a new level of respect for the Ocean after feeling how powerful it truly is. Mother Nature can be fierce, devastating and truly terrifying. Yet she is tranquil, peaceful and has shown us a side of beauty that we have never experienced before. We did not conquer the North Atlantic, the ocean merely allowed us to pass.

Ocean Revival row across the North Atlantic raised money to support the charities [Plastic Oceans](https://plasticoceans.uk/) and the [Royal Marines Charity](https://rma-trmc.org/).

> Inspiring to see the [@RevivalOcean](https://twitter.com/RevivalOcean?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) 2020 team cross the finish line of their epic 3,700 mile row from New York to London.
> 
> You've done this country proud and raised huge funds for [@oceangen\_](https://twitter.com/oceangen_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and [@theRMcharity](https://twitter.com/theRMcharity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) in the process.
