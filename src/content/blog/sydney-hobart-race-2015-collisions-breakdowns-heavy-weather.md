Her crew is attempting repairs before deciding whether to continue or retire from the race. Super-maxi *[Perpetual Loyal](http://www.perpetualloyal.com.au/)* also retired from the race with a damaged rudder. *[Rambler](http://www.rolexsydneyhobart.com/the-yachts/2015/rambler/)* has now taken the lead.
