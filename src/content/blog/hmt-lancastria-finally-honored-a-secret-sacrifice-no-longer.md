![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/10/RMSLancastria.jpg)The tragic loss of an estimated 6,500 men, women and children on the [*Lancastria*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lancastria) was covered up for more than seventy years. It was the greatest loss of life in the sinking of a single British ship, claiming more lives than the combined losses of the [RMS *Titanic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic "RMS Titanic")  and [RMS *Lusitania*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania "RMS Lusitania") (1,200 passengers).  Here is a [repost from 2011,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/hmt-lancastria-finally-honored-a-secret-sacrifice-no-more/) in honor of those lost on this day seventy five years ago.  First posted October 2, 2011:

The evacuation of British troops and civilians from France in 1940 did not end with Dunkirk. Several weeks later,   on June 17, 1940, the British Cunard liner *[Lancastria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lancastria)* was loaded to capacity with troops and civilians off the French port of St. Nazaire, when she was struck by three direct hits from a German Junkers Ju 88 bomber.  As many as 6,500 men, women, and children were lost when the ship sank.  News of the disaster was covered up. Churchill said, “*The newspapers have got quite enough disaster for today, at least.*”

71 years after the sinking, the “[silent sacrifice](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/lancastria_01.shtml)” of those aboard the *Lancastria* was finally acknowledged as a memorial to the victims was unveiled on the banks of the Clyde at the site of the shipyard where the ship was built.

[Victims of HMT Lancastria sinking honoured with memorial](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/world-war-2/8800910/Victims-of-HMT-Lancastria-sinking-honoured-with-memorial.html)

*Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond is to unveil a memorial on Saturday on the banks of the Clyde, at the site of what was the William Beardmore and Sons shipbuilding yard where HMT Lancastria was constructed.*

*The memorial is a bronze sculpture, set on a granite block with a commemorative text, and was created by Fife artist Marion Smith. The bronze represents the early steel sheet construction of the Lancastria.*

*Walter Hirst was a Sapper with 663 Company, The Royal Engineers. About one-third (91) of the men in his company died when the Lancastria sank.*

*Mr Hirst, 42, from Jedburgh in the Borders, said: “The memorial to the victims of the Lancastria is a fitting and lasting tribute to the thousands who died in what remains Britain’s worst ever maritime disaster.*

*“Their sacrifice was ignored for decades because successive British governments refused to formally acknowledge the loss of the Lancastria for propaganda reasons.*

*“The site on which the new memorial stands is where the Lancastria was constructed in 1920 and where this once great liner came to life.*

*“The unveiling of this memorial brings the story full circle and I am certain it will be a place of pilgrimage and remembrance in the years to come.”*
