[We last posted about HMS Pickle when she was for sale back in 2008](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2008/09/hms-pickle-is-for-sale/) when the asking price was £350,000.00.  From the Seller’s Notes of Ebay:  “*Pickle is in need of some work to bring her up to scratch*.” Apparently while in good shape below the waterline, the schooner needs a few new deck planks and beams.   [Click here to learn more.](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/331254398155?ssPageName=STRK%3AMESELX%3AIT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649#viTabs_0)
