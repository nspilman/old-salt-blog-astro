![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/annapht.jpg)Climate change deniers can choose to ignore the overwhelming scientific consensus of man-made climate change all they want. How long they will continue to deny the evidence before their own eyes? Two immediate examples — Fox Island and the US Naval Academy.

For 40 years, the [Chesapeake Bay Foundation has run educational programs on Fox Island](https://www.cbf.org/blogs/save-the-bay/2019/10/farewell-to-fox.html), an island between the Tangier and Pocomoke sounds. This is the last year, however. Rising sea levels have effectively washed the island away.

[The Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/environment/ac-cn-fox-island-bay-foundation-1018-20191018-wgac7b26ejaadl4g34q6o5tmfi-story.html) reports that after analyzing historic aerial photos, the foundation estimates the bay has swallowed up more than 70% of the island’s land in the last 50 years.

Foundation educators say sea level rise and erosion are destroying the protective salt marshes surrounding the island, making the foundation’s educational center there unsafe to continue operating for students in the future. [The Fox Island Education Program will conclude its final season this fall.](https://www.cbf.org/blogs/save-the-bay/2019/10/farewell-to-fox.html) 

Islands in the Chesapeake are not the only areas being impacted by rising sea levels. Parts of the US Naval Academy at Annapolis are also regularly awash at high tide.  In the October edition of [*Proceedings*](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2019/october/climate-change-coming-annapolis), Commander Pat Paterson, U.S. Navy (Retired) in an article titled, [*Climate Change is Coming for Annapolis*](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2019/october/climate-change-coming-annapolis), writes:

*The Academy and Annapolis already are experiencing the effects of climate change. Annapolis has seen the highest increased rate of coastal flooding in the United States. In 2018, the downtown area flooded about once a week from high tides, threatening businesses along the City Dock and Market Street. Next door, the Academy also sees evidence of rising water. Low-lying areas adjacent to College Creek frequently are closed by high water. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that has warned of the effects of global warming for years, these areas will flood daily rather than weekly by 2050.*

Just this month the United States Sailboat Show in Annapolis was [shortened because of street flooding](https://www.capitalgazette.com/environment/ac-cn-proceedings-except-20191013-43rodczawne7ziviweim72cvmq-story.html). The boats kept floating. The street and bridges, not so much. 

Further south, the Mar-a-Lago resort, whose owner calls climate change a “Chinese hoax,” may be [awash by the turn of the century](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-climate-change-mar-a-lago-florida-flooded-sea-level-rise-global-warming-winter-white-a7677596.html), if not sooner, according to recent projections.

Overall, an estimated [126 million people in the United States alone](https://www.earth.com/news/americans-threatened-sea-level-rise/) are threatened by rising sea levels.
