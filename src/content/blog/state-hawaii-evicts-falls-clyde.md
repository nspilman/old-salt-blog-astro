![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/08/Falls_of_Clyde1.jpg)In May 2015, we [posted that the State of Hawaii](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/05/the-end-of-falls-of-clyde-too-many-broken-promises/) has put the [Friends of Falls of Clyde](http://www.friendsoffallsofclyde.org/), the organization responsible for rescuing the historic ship of the same name, on notice that the state planned to terminate the permit which allowed the ship to be docked for free in Honolulu. “T*hey received the ship from the Bishop Museum with the understanding it would go into dry dock quickly. It has been 6 years and it doesn’t appear we are any closer to putting it into dry dock,*” said Hawaii State Department of Transportation Deputy Director Darrell Young. Now, a year later, the state apparently has had enough. They have revoked a permit that allowed the Falls of Clyde to moor at Pier 7 and given the Friends of Falls of Clyde until July 15th to move the vessel and restore Pier 7 to a safe condition.

A statement from the Hawaii Department of Transportation Harbors Division (HDOT Harbors) reads, in part: *The condition of the Falls of Clyde poses an unacceptable risk to navigation in Honolulu Harbor and a safety and security risk to harbor users.*

*The Friends of Falls of Clyde were asked to provide proof that they had the resources necessary to restore the vessel to a condition that would allow it to safely berth in Honolulu Harbor. They were unable to meet this request.*
