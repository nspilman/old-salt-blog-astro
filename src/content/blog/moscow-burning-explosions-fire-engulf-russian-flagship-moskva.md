Exactly what happened is unclear. 

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-flagship-black-sea-fleet-badly-damaged-by-blast-2022-04-14/) reports that Ukraine’s southern military command said that it hit the warship with a Ukrainian-made [Neptune anti-ship missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_\(cruise_missile\)) and that it had started to sink.

Russia said that a fire broke out aboard the ship that caused an explosion of ammunition. They say that the crew of its Black Sea fleet flagship were evacuated on Thursday and measures were being taken to tow the ship back to port. 

State media outlets TASS and RIA, citing the Russian Defense Ministry, said the *Moskva* had been seriously damaged in the incident and that the cause of the fire was being investigated. The Russian reports gave no information on possible casualties. 

“The loss of not just a principal surface combatant in the Russian navy, but also the fleet flagship, would amount to more of a psychological blow to the Russians,” Collin Koh, an expert on maritime security at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University told the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/14/ukraine-russian-missile-cruiser-moskva-warship/).

The notion that Ukrainian missiles hit the Moskva reinforces “the image of hardened resistance by the Ukrainians” and sows “more doubt in the minds of Russian servicemen,” particularly the sailors serving on Russian warships off Ukraine’s southern coast, he added
