I would argue that the wind is, in fact, created by the sun, so all sailing ships are also solar powered, perhaps once removed. The [Turanor Planetsolar](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=Turanor+Planetsolar) is, nevertheless, a fascinating vessel. Following her [successful circumnavigation](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/05/solar-powered-ms-turanor-planetsolar-completes-circumnavigation-in-584-days/), she is now engaged in solar research.  See our [previous posts](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=Turanor+Planetsolar). She recently visited New York. Thanks to Irwin Bryan for contributing to this post.
