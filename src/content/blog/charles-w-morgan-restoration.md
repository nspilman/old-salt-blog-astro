We posted yesterday about the “shutter plank” being fastened to the whaleship [*Charles W. Morgan*](http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&page_id=B3E63C64-B3CA-45AE-A83D72C303A9C6BF) in Mystic Seaport in Connecticut.  The *Morgan*, built in 1841, is America’s last surviving wooden whaleship and has been undergoing a fiver year restoration.   I came a across  a wonderful short video by Ed Dzitko, which gives a good idea of the scope of that restoration, as well as providing  a bit of the ship’s history.
