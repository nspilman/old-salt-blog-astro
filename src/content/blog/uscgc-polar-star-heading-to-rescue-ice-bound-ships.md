![Polar_Star_2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Polar_Star_2.jpg)The [USCGC *Polar Star*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Polar_Star_\(WAGB-10\)) is on its way to attempt to break free two ice-bound ship off Antarctica.   So far, three icebreakers have attempted to free the the [MV *Akademik Shokalskiy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademik_Shokalskiy), which has been stuck in Antarctic ice south of Tasmania since Christmas Eve.  The Chinese ice breaker,  *[*Xue Long* or](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Xue_Long) *[Snow Dragon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Xue_Long)**, has now become stuck in the ice as well, after successfully evacuating the passengers from the cruise ship by helicopter to the Australian icebreaker,  *[Aurora Australis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Australis_\(icebreaker\)).*  The *Polar Star* sailed from Sydney on Saturday and is expected to arrive at the stricken ships, which are roughly 1,500 miles south of Hobart, around January 12th.

Will the *Polar Star* succeed where the other icebreakers failed?   If she succeeds, it will come down to one word – horsepower.  The *Polar Star* is a smaller ship than the *Snow Dragon*.  The *Snow Dragon* is 50% longer and has roughly twice the displacement. Both have diesel engines which provide around 18,000 HP.  The *Polar Star* however, also has three gas turbines, which can deliver up to 75,000 HP through three controllable pitch propellers.  So, while the *Polar Star* may be smaller and lighter than the *Snow Dragon,* it has about four times the horsepower.  The *Polar Star* is capable of breaking six feet of ice at at sustained speed of three knots, while the *Snow Dragon* is capable of a breaking just under four feet of ice at a speed of around 1.5 knots.

The *Polar Star,* built in 1976, recently completed an approximately $60 million overhaul and refurbishment.
