![hornsea](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/hornsea.jpg)Recently, [we posted about the first offshore wind farm](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/08/first-us-offshore-wind-farm-off-block-island-island-long-history-wind-power/) in the US — the [Deepwater Wind](http://dwwind.com/project/block-island-wind-farm/) Project which is installing five turbines with an installed capacity of 30 MW off Block Island, RI.  While this is definitely progress, it is also a reminder of how far behind the US is in developing offshore wind power as compared to the rest of the world.

Last week, the UK approved [Hornsea Two](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/hornsea-project-two-windfarm-second-phase-grimsby), the second phase of the world’s largest wind farm. The 300 turbine project by Denmark’s Dong Energy is fifty-five miles off the coast of Grimsby and is expected to deliver 1.8 gigawatts of clean electricity to 1.8m UK homes.  With the 1.2 gigawatts developed by phase one of the project, Hornsby One, the combined project will supply 3 gigawatts, enough to power 2.5 million average (U.S.) households. If the third phase of the project is completed, Hornsea will have a total capacity of 4 gigawatts.
