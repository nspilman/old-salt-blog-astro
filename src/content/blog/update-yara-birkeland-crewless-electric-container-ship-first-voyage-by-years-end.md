![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/08/Yara-Birkeland.jpg)In 2017, we posted “ [Yara Birkeland, Autonomous Container Ship — Is This Really a Good Idea?](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/10/mv-yara-birkeland-autonomous-container-ship-really-good-idea/)” The question remains unanswered, but we may have a better idea when the 103 TEU, all-electric, crewless feeder ship is delivered and completes its maiden voyage toward the end of 2021. The ship will be powered by 7 MWh battery bank and should be capable of top speed of 13 knots. 

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/world/yara-birkeland-norway-crewless-container-ship-spc-intl/index.html) reports that if all goes to plan, the ship will make its first journey between two Norwegian towns before the end of the year, with no crew onboard. Instead, its movements will be monitored from three onshore data control centers. 

When operational, *Yara Birkeland* will sail on two routes, between Herøya and Brevik (~7 nautical miles (13 km)) and between Herøya and Larvik (~30 nautical miles (56 km)).

Developed by chemical company [Yara International](https://www.yara.com/), the *Yara Birkeland* was created in partnership with technology firm [Kongsberg Maritime](https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/) and shipbuilder [Vard](https://www.vard.com/).

It remains unclear the extent to which the new ship will be autonomous. Semi-autonomous remote-controlled may be a better description.  According to [Kongsberg Maritime](https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/support/themes/autonomous-ship-project-key-facts-about-yara-birkeland/) the three onshore data control centers monitoring the ship “will handle emergency and exception handling, condition monitoring, operational monitoring, decision support, surveillance of the autonomous ship and its surroundings and all other aspects of safety.” 

The cost of operating three control centers may, however, negate the savings of unmanned operations.
