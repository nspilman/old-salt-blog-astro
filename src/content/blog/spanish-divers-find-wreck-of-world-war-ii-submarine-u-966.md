![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/u-966.jpg)In June, three Spanish divers located the wreck of the German World War II submarine U-966 near the coast of Galicia in north-west Spain. The [BBC reports](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44741045) that the submarine’s wreckage is spread widely in a very rocky area where rough weather often makes diving impossible. The debris was photographed at a depth of 24-26m (79-85ft). One of the divers, naval historian Yago Abilleira, said they had found the wreckage near Estaca de Bares. They are not revealing the exact location, as it is a war grave.

The U-966 was a [Type VIIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_VII_submarine#Type_VIIC) German submarine, commissioned in March 1943, built at Blohm & Voss, Hamburg. The submarine was attacked by US Navy and RAF bombers in November 1943 as it was fleeing toward neutral Spain. An RAF Wellington bomber dropped depth charges. One Allied plane was shot down – reportedly an RAF Catalina flying boat. After U-966 suffered heavy damage, the crew scuttled the submarine with timed charges. Of the crew of 52, eight died and 44 made it to shore.  When it was scuttled, U-966 was on its first patrol and had sunk no Allied ships.
