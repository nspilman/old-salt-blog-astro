![hmsprometheus](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/12/hmsprometheus.jpg)Alaric Bond’s new novel *[HMS Prometheus](http://www.amazon.com/HMS-Prometheus-Fighting-Sail-Book-ebook/dp/B018WDRQAS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1450216352&sr=1-1&keywords=alaric+bond)* is the eighth book in his Fighting Sail Series. Here is a review by David Hayes from [Historic Naval Fiction](http://www.historicnavalfiction.com/general-hnf-info/book-reviews/review-hms-prometheus-by-alaric-bond):

Following her action against the French (see *[The Scent of Corruption](http://www.amazon.com/Scent-Corruption-Fighting-Sail-Series-ebook/dp/B00Z71JFTE/ref=pd_sim_351_1?ie=UTF8&dpID=51Fd0xNQajL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR113%2C160_&refRID=1RM4Z92ZBT00K2XAP3ZE)*) HMS *Prometheus* is repaired at Gibraltar and sent into the Mediterranean to join Nelson’s fleet blockading Toulon. Damaged in an action she is soon heading back to Gibraltar taking a prize on the way. Repaired once again she heads back to Toulon but encounters a powerful French squadron.

There is plenty of action in the narrative with challenges and life changing consequences for Bond’s mixture of old, new and returning characters. A well-written plot with a good pace that is hard to put down.

Another excellent read from one of the best contemporary naval fiction authors. Highly recommended.
