Last week we [posted about a distress call to the Coast Guard](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/12/coast-guard-report-of-explosion-on-yacht-blind-date-a-likely-hoax/) reporting a yacht explosion off the New Jersey shore, which was an apparent hoax.  The search and rescue operation which resulted is estimated to have [cost over $300,000.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/13/the-blind-date-explosion-hoax-tallying-the-cost/)  Now the Coast Guard is noting the similarities in an [distress call received near Galveston, Texas](http://news.yahoo.com/coast-guard-searching-off-texas-fishing-boat-distress-192500586.html) on May 20 which is also believed to have been a hoax.  In both cases the caller used a high frequency Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service radio channel, a channel not typically used for reporting emergencies. The phrasing and terminology used in both hoax calls was also very similar. and may have reflected a knowledge of Coast Guard procedures.  The voice on the calls was very similar and is now being analysed by experts.

Making a false call is a federal felony, with a maximum penalty of six years in prison, a $250,000 fine and reimbursement to the Coast Guard for the cost of performing the search.
