[Retirement of adm. on hold in video inquiry](http://militarytimes.com/news/2011/01/navy-admirals-retirement-on-hold-011311w/)

*In an indication of just how seriously the Navy is taking the investigation into the racy shipboard videos aired four years ago aboard the carrier Enterprise, the scheduled Feb. 1 retirement of the ship’s captain at the time — now Rear Adm. Larry Rice — has been put on hold.*  
  
*“His retirement has been deferred pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation,” Rear Adm. Denny Moynihan, chief of naval information at the Pentagon, said Thursday.*

*Rice, serving as director of strategy and policy for U.S. Joint Forces Command, would have brought a 31-year year career that included more than 3,700 flight hours in Navy fighter jets to a close next month. Instead, he will now report to Fleet Forces Command chief Adm. John Harvey, Moynihan said.*

*Harvey has launched an investigation into the production of the videos. Officials say it is focused on the actions of senior officers who at the time knew of the videos, and what they did or did not do in response.*
