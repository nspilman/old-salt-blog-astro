Herman Melville

Today is the birthday of [Herman Melville](http://www.melville.org/), one of the greatest American writers. He was born in 1819 on Pearl Street in downtown Manhattan, almost directly across the Hudson from where I am now writing this post. He will always be remembered for his masterpiece [*Moby Dick*](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/moby-dick-annotated-unabridged-herman-melville/1109518290?ean=2940014322560). Ironically, *Moby Dick*, published in 1851, was not a critical or commercial success and ruined Melville’s reputation, and indeed his career, as a writer. Melville’s books were out of print for decades before his death. He spent his last 19 years as a customs inspector in Manhattan.

Also, on August 1, 1833, [Sailor’s Snug Harbor](http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/sailorssnugharbor/history) opened on Staten Island and the first 37 old and indigent mariners moved into the retirement community built for them with money left by [Captain Robert Randall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Richard_Randall). Over 40,000 sailors would ultimately retire to Sailor’s Snug Harbor. Captain Thomas Melville, a retired sea captain and Herman Melville’s brother, would serve as governor of Snug Harbor from 1867 to 1884. See the video about Snug Harbor after the page break.

And finally on this day in 1798, Nelson ruined Napoleon’s plans in Egypt by destroying much of the French fleet in the [Battle of the Nile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Nile), which was not actually fought in the Nile but in Aboukir Bay.
