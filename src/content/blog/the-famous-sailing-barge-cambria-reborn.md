The [Thames sailing barge Cambria](http://www.cambriatrust.org.uk/) was built in Greenhithe, Kent in 1906.  Remarkably, she kept sailing  and [carrying commercial cargo under sail alone until 1970](http://www.cambriatrust.org.uk/cambria_barge_history/index.htm).  She is now undergoing a complete restoration by the Cambria Trust with major funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. They are still, however,  in need of sponsors to ensure a complete and full restoration.

[The famous Sailing Barge CAMBRIA](http://www.cambriatrust.org.uk/)  
  
*Once fully restored, CAMBRIA will be used for sail training and educational purposes, thus preserving the vessel and introducing her to a new audience who will be taught how she traded under sail alone – a supreme example of environmental transport which will also promote an understanding of new alternative technologies.*

*Operating as a floating classroom, CAMBRIA will moor at a variety of locations throughout the Thames, Medway and Swale estuaries, offering environmental training and education in social and economic history for Junior school children, working closely with educational charities, port authorities, local authorities and the RSPB.*

*CAMBRIA will also operate as a floating interpretative centre explaining the past, present and future of London River and encouraging interest and support from the general public.*

*Young people and apprentices will undergo sail training aboard the barge, and the general public will also be able to charter CAMBRIA so that they can experience the joy of sailing aboard this magnificent vessel.*
