![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/usstheodoreroosevelt.jpg)The plan was to start moving sailors who had completed a 14-day coronavirus quarantine back on the carrier USS *Theodore Roosevelt* beginning this Saturday. [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/21/navy-extends-isolation-for-uss-theodore-roosevelt-sailors-may-delay-ship-departure-198081) reports that that plan has been delayed after a number of sailors tested positive for the virus even after their isolation period. Some of the sailors who recently tested positive had previously tested negative, one Navy official said. The ship has been dockside in Guam since March 27th.

The move potentially delays the ship’s departure amid new questions about the spread of Covid-19.

“Results of out-testing portions of the TR crew following 14 days of quarantine leads us to reevaluate our assessment of how the virus can remain active in an asymptomatic host,” according to a Navy directive sent to the crew and viewed by Politico.

“While further assessment is made regarding test-out procedures, I am directing a halt to all crew out-testing and holding any release from isolation and quarantine,” the message read.

[As of Tuesday](https://www.stripes.com/news/us/nine-uss-theodore-roosevelt-sailors-in-navy-hospital-as-ship-s-coronavirus-cases-surpass-700-1.626907), 94% of the *Roosevelt*’s crew has been tested for the coronavirus as the ship nears a month since it docked in Guam due to the outbreak aboard the ship. About 710 sailors have tested positive, with 42 sailors now recovered from the virus, according to the Navy. Nine sailors are currently in the hospital. About 3,872 crewmembers have received a negative test result.

A 41-year-old chief petty officer from the ship died from complications stemming from COVID-19 last week after he was admitted to the ICU at U.S. Naval Hospital Guam.
