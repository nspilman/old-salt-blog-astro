Fewer than 300 people live on the [Tristan da Cuhna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_da_Cunha) island chain, the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, 2,816 kilometres from the nearest land.  An estimated 200,000  penguins, however, including roughly half of the world’s endangered [Northern Rockhopper penguin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rockhopper_Penguin), call the islands home.  When the [bulk carrier *Olivia*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/index.php?s=olivia) grounded and then broke up on March 16 off Nightingale Island,  it became a race to save as many penguins as possible from the up to 1,500 metric tons of heavy fuel that spilled when the 75,000 tonne  bulker broke up.

[Penguin rescue operation under way after south Atlantic oil spill](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/04/02/atlantic.penguin.rescue.operation/index.html?hpt=C1)

*On an island chain located halfway between Africa and Argentina, local authorities say a massive penguin rescue operation is under way.*

*A mix of island officials and resident volunteers are struggling to save tens of thousands of Northern Rockhopper penguins threatened by an oil spill in the remote stretches of the south Atlantic, roughly 1,500 miles west of Cape Town, South Africa.*

*The islands’ conservation director said at least 300 penguins have died after a cargo ship leaked thousands of tons of heavy oil, diesel fuel and soya bean near Nightingale Island, a British territory part of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago.*

*“I’ve seen about 15 to 20 dead penguins just today,” director Trevor Glass said.*

*Thousands more are covered in the ships’ oil and diesel fuel, according to local officials and conservationists.*

*“The danger now is getting the rest of these penguins past that oil slick,” Glass said.*

*Rescue workers, using inflatable watercraft and fishing vessels, are now ferrying penguins to a series of makeshift rehabilitation centers at the main island of Tristan da Cunha, according to Glass.*

*There, he added, conservationists and volunteers are working in an effort to nurse the blackened penguins back to health.*

*“We need help,” said Katrine Herian, a spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds who is also apart of the ongoing rescue effort.*

*“The priority is to get food into the birds as they are very hungry,” she said. “We are trying locally caught fish and some are starting to take small half-inch squares of the food.”*

*Herian noted that some of the islands’ residents had emptied their personal freezers in an effort to help feed the animals.*

*By Friday, Glass said his team had corralled and transported a total of nearly 5,000 penguins, despite harsh winds and high seas that had hampered earlier rescue attempts.*

*But the timing of their task is daunting.*

*The shipwreck, having occurred at the end of the birds’ molting season — a period during which penguins shed their feathers, do not eat and largely stay out of the water — left the birds “at their weakest possible state,” Guggenheim explained. “They’re very hungry.”*

*The season’s end also marks the beginning of a period when penguins re-enter the sea, now laden with heavy oil and soya beans.*

*In a written statement, Tristin da Cunha administrator Burns said it is unclear what the impact of the ship’s cargo will have on the local marine environment, particularly “any long-term effect on the economically valuable fishing industry for crawfish, crayfish or Tristan Rock Lobster … which is the mainstay of Tristan da Cunha’s economy.”*
