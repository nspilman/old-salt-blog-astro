How is your day going? We hope that it is going better than the folks who were load testing a new 90 meter high Liebherr TLC crane on the [offshore installation support vessel *Orion 1*.](https://www.marinelog.com/news/c-job-provides-design-package-for-advanced-installation-vessel/) The crane had a 160-meter long boom and is designed to have a lifting height of up to 180 meters—almost twice as high as the Statue of Liberty—and a lifting capacity of 5,000 tonnes at more than 30 meters outreach. We use the past tense of “had” a 160-meter long boom, because [during the load test something went badly wrong](https://www.marinelog.com/shipping/safety-and-security/video-massive-offshore-crane-collapses-under-load-tests/), as can be seen in the video below. Fortunately, there are no reports of anyone seriously injured in the accident.

*Orion 1* is owned by COSCO (QIDONG) OFFSHORE CO., LTD, and was moored at the quayside at the Liebherr construction yard in Rostock, Germany during the load test.
