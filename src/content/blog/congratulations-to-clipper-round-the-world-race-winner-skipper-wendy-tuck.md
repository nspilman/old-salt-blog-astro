Wendy Tuck

The top two spots in the [Clipper Round the World Race](https://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/) were, for the first time, won by women.  Australian [Wendy Tuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Tuck) has become the first female skipper to win the Clipper Round-the-World race.  British skipper [Nikki Henderson](https://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/news/article/meet-clipper-201718-race-skipper-nikki-henderson), 25, came in second with her team in the 40,000-mile contest. Thousands watched the race finish in Liverpool, [nearly a year after 12 yachts set out from the city.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-40991712)

The 53-year-old told the [Australian Daily Telegraph](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/swoop/sydney-sailor-wendy-tuck-makes-history-with-victory-in-clipper-race/news-story/f01f8960f48b2ab47e910e2f90af1803): “I hate banging on about women. I just do what I do but I am very proud.” 

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-44981245) quotes race co-founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the first person to sail solo nonstop around the world, said: “If you realize that more people have climbed Mount Everest than have sailed around the world, you realize just what these people have done. There has never been a round-the-world sailing race where the leading skippers are women,” he added.
