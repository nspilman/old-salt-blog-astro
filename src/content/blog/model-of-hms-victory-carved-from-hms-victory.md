![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/hms-vi61.jpg)We previously [posted about a model of the Mayflower](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/10/14/model-mayflower-fashioned-from-actual-ships-timber/) crafted from timber believed to used on the original ship that carried the Pilgrims to America.   [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) passed along an article about a model of the *HMS Victory* by sculptor and woodcarver Ian G Brennan carved from original centuries old oak beams removed from *HMS Victory*’s lower gun deck during the restoration program in 1991.  Beautiful work.
