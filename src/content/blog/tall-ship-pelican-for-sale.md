![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/01/pelican1.jpg)One of the most beautiful and most interesting tall ship sailing today, at least to my eye, is the three-masted barquentine *[Pelican](http://www.adventureundersail.com/index.html).*  The *Pelican* is 148ft long overall, square rigged on the main mast but fore and aft rigged on the fore mast and mizzen, a modern hybrid between a traditional square rig and the mixed square and fore and aft rig of the Barbary coast Xebecs.

The *Pelican* is also now [actively for sale with an asking price of £2,450,000](http://www.easternyachts.com/pelicanoflondon/index.htm).

[Weymouth’s Tall Ship is yours for £2.45m](http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/localnews/9679925.Weymouth_s_Tall_Ship_is_yours_for___2_45m/)  
  
*Trustees of the Adventure Under Sail Limited (AUSL) charity say it is ‘business as usual’ and their youth training voyages will remain unaffected while a buyer is sought.*

*Bookings are being taken as normal and fundraising is under way to assist youngsters with bursaries.* 

*The action-packed programme for the TS Pelican includes participating in the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on June 3, the International Tall Ships Races throughout July and August and a winter programme in the Caribbean.* 

*The ship first went on open market sale in 2009 for an asking price of £4million.*
