![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/socratesplaque.jpg)[Jeanne Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Socrates) was 76 when she set sail alone from Victoria, British Columbia, in October 2018, on her 38′ yacht *Nereida*. She returned to Victoria 339 days later, then 77, having sailed singlehanded non-stop around world, becoming the oldest sailor to do so. On a previous circumnavigation, she also set a record as the only woman to have circumnavigated solo nonstop from North America.

Last November, her home port honored Jeanne Socrates by naming the dock in Victoria’s Inner Harbor where *Nereida* is berthed in her honor. A plaque now identifies the commercial dock as the [Jeanne Socrates Dock](https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/victoria-dock-named-in-honour-of-round-the-world-sailor-jeanne-socrates-1.24015769).

Last week the city also installed a [bronze plaque in her honor](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10163907443335486&set=a.10158124581095486&type=3&theater) on Victoria’s Wall of History overlooking the Inner Harbour, to commemorate her epic voyages.

Congratulations, Jeanne. Well deserved.
