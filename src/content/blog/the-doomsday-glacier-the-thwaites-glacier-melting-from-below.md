![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/thwaites.jpg)As has so often been the case, predictions of the impact of climate change have been proven to be inaccurate. The problem is not that they have been too alarmist, but that they haven’t been alarmist enough. For the past several years, scientists have warned of the [melting of West Antarctica’s Thwaites glacier](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/the-doomsday-glacier-113792/), which now appears to be melting faster than had been feared.

As described by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51097309): *Glaciologists have described [Thwaites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thwaites_Glacier) as the “most important” glacier in the world, the “riskiest” glacier, even the “doomsday” glacier. It is massive – roughly the size of Britain. It already accounts for 4% of world sea-level rise each year – a huge figure for a single glacier – and satellite data show that it is melting increasingly rapidly.* 

Recently a [multimillion-dollar British and U.S. initiative](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/04/30/unprecedented-u-s-british-project-launches-to-study-the-worlds-most-dangerous-glacier/) has discovered warm ocean water underneath the massive glacier that could speed its melt with the potential to eventually unleash more than 10 feet of sea-level rise.

“That is really, really bad,” said David Holland, a New York University glaciologist, to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/01/30/unprecedented-data-confirm-that-antarcticas-most-dangerous-glacier-is-melting-below/). “That’s not a sustainable situation for that glacier.”

Scientists already knew that Thwaites was losing massive amounts of ice — more than 600 billion tons over the past several decades, and most recently as much as 50 billion tons per year. And it was widely believed that this was occurring because a layer of relatively warmer ocean water, which circles Antarctica below the colder surface layer, had moved closer to shore and begun to eat away at the glaciers themselves, affecting West Antarctica in particular.

But that had not been directly confirmed because Thwaites is gigantic (larger than the state of Pennsylvania) and exceedingly difficult to reach.

“The biggest thing to say at the moment is, indeed, there is very warm water there, and clearly, it could not have been there forever, or the glacier could not be there,” Holland said.
