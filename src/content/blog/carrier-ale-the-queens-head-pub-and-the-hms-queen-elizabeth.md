Carrier Ale

A quick two-question quiz — First question: What do US aircraft carriers have that the newest British carrier, HMS *Queen Elizabeth*, lacks?  The answer is aircraft. The UK’s new aircraft carrier will be conducting flight trials with two borrowed US planes. Its own planes have begun to be delivered as of last June but are not expected to be deployed on the ship until 2019.

Second Question — What does the HMS *Queen Elizabeth* have which all US carriers lack? A proper English pub, of course. The pub, known as the Queen’s Head, was christened recently aboard the *Queen Elizabeth* and will be available to officers and senior enlisted during the ship’s maiden transit of the Atlantic. 

As reported by the [Military Times](https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/military-culture/2018/08/20/commence-jealousy-the-royal-navy-just-opened-a-pub-on-its-prized-new-carrier/): *The Wiltshire-based Wadworth brewery, which created an ale specifically for the ship’s December 2017 commissioning — a beverage appropriately named “Carrier Ale” — was instrumental in bringing the pub to life.*

*“It has been a long time in the planning, well before the carrier was commissioned last year,” brewery CEO Chris Welham said in a [Wadworth press release](https://www.wadworth.co.uk/article/news/wadworth-helps-royal-navy-sailors-quench-their-thirst-on-board-hms-queen-elizabeth/). “The Mess looks really great and will provide a relaxing environment along with some fine beer for the team on board when they have some downtime.*”

By sometime next year, HMS *Queen Elizabeth* will have her planes, while the US Navy will still not have a single official pub aboard any of its ships. The ships of the U.S. Navy officially became dry under General Order No. 99, issued on July 1, 1914.
