Though often confused with flying fish, the [Japanese flying squid, *Todarodes pacificus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Flying_Squid), uses jet propulsion to leap out of the sea and fly up to 65ft to escape predators.   Graham Ekins, 60, a retired deputy head teacher from Boreham, Essex, recently documented their aerial performances in the waters south of Japan.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for passing the article along.
