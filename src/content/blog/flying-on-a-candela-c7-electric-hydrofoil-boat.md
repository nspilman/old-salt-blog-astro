![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/candela7.jpg)On Saturday, we posted about the [world’s largest electric ferry](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/11/basto-electric-worlds-largest-electric-ferry-in-service-in-norway/). Here is a very different electric watercraft, an all-electric hydrofoil runabout that literally flies above the water.

[Candela Speed Boat AB](https://candela.com/) has been referred to by Bloomberg as “[Sweden’s Tesla of the Sea](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-26/sweden-s-tesla-of-the-sea-challenges-fossil-fueled-speedboats).” The firm is developing high-efficiency all-electric hydrofoil speed boats. Built of carbon fiber, once on foils the Candela uses 75% less energy than a conventional planing boat. The 25′ long Candela C-7 requires just 28 horsepower to fly along at 20 knots. The C-7 is capable of cruising for 50 nautical miles at 23 knots on a single charge.

Candela has recently unveiled its 8.5-meter (28-foot) model C-8, with berths for two adults and two children, designed for volume production. The firm is also preparing to test a 30-seat hydrofoil ferry on Stockholm’s waterways in 2023, and is in talks with some 45 cities about delivering passenger vessels.
