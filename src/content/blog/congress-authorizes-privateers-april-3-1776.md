Two hundred and forty years ago today, the [Continental Congress authorized the commissioning of privateers](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/congress-authorizes-privateers-to-attack-british-vessels) to attack British ships. It was still three months before the [Declaration of Independence](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html) from Great Britain.  The legislation was in many respects simply catching up with what was already going on in New England and elsewhere along the coast. A year earlier, in the spring of 1775, the colony of Massachusetts had begun commissioning privateers. Likewise, General Washington began chartering schooners to act as commerce raiders to help supply his army surrounding Boston.

Over the course of the war, about 1,700 [Letters of Marque and Reprisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_marque), which is to say, privateering commissions, were granted to nearly 800 privateering vessels, which captured or destroyed about 600 British ships. By comparison, the Continental Navy never numbered more than 70 vessels and captured fewer than 200 British ships.

The nature of privateering is often misunderstood. They were not pirates. Privateers were private vessels of war commissioned by a state or nation. They may often be called pirates, but this ignores both history and the law. International law defines piracy as violence or theft on the high seas for private ends. Privateers’ commissions, the Letter of Marque, separated them from pirates acting “for private ends.”

Privateers were limited to attacking only enemy ships. They were required to sail the captured ships to an Admiralty Court where ships and cargo would be sold at auction. The commission also provided rules for the treatment of prisoners — requirements totally alien to the practice of piracy. Is is true that some privateers became outright pirates at the end of a war and that some pirates used forged letters of marque to pretend to be pirates. Nevertheless, the two are fundamentally different.

Privateers had most of the rights and responsibilities of naval vessels but were privately owned. Like naval vessels, the owners, officers, and crew of the privateer were awarded “[prize money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize_money)” for the capture of enemy ships and cargo after they had been auctioned. Both privateers and commissioned naval officers could become wealthy from prize money. [The US Navy continued granting prize money to its officers and crews until 1941.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize_money#Examples) The crewmen of USS *Omaha* received prize money for taking a German blockade runner on 6 November 1941, just before America’s entry into World War II.

One of the reason, that there has been so much confusion about privateers may be related to their role as commerce raiders. While privateers could, and did, do battle with naval vessels, the targets of choice were unarmed merchantmen, which offered lower risks and higher profits. Many historians refer to commerce raiding as the work of privateers, regardless of what form of commission the captain carried.

[Captain John Manley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Manley_\(naval_officer\)) is often referred to as a privateer when in 1775, in Boston harbor, while in command of the schooner *Hannah*, he captured the British ordnance vessel, *Nancy*, loaded with 2,000 muskets, 31 tons of musket shot, 30,000 round shot of various sizes, 100,000 musket flints, 11 mortar beds, and a 2,700-pound 13-inch mortar — supplies needed desperately by the American army surrounding Boston. As Washington had no authority to issue Letters of Marque, Captain Manley was considered to be an officer in the Continental Army.

Likewise, in 1779, Commodore [Abraham Whipple](http://gaspee.org/AbrahamWhipple.html), sailing in a squadron of three ships off Newfoundland successfully captured ten ships in a British convoy without firing a shot. The three captains; Whipple, Rathbun, and Simpson; were hailed as “bold privateers” in the broadsides of the day, celebrating the capture, even though all three were commissioned naval officers. On the other hand, Abraham Whipple did have a history as a very successful privateer during the French and Indian Wars, capturing 23 French ships in one six-month cruise.  Many of the best officers in the Continental Navy began their careers as privateers.

John Paul Jones, also a commissioned officer, was variously called a [pirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Jones#/media/File:Paul_Jones_the_pirate.jpg) and a privateer by the British press.

Privateering is still referenced in the US Constitution, Article I, Sec. 8 cl. 11, which includes in the duties of Congress: *To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;*.

Nevertheless, as a matter of international law, privateering was abolished in 1856 by the [Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Declaration_Respecting_Maritime_Law).
