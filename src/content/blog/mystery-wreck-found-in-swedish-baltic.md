Recently a very interesting shipwreck was discovered in the waters between the islands of Gotland and Öland off the east coast of Sweden.  The article seems to claim that it is the “world’s intact oldest wreck” though most apparently think that the ship dates from between the 12th and the 14th centuries. Some however,  enthusiastically hope that the wreck is the legendary ship that carried the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag home after his sacking of Visby on Gotland, in 1361 AD.  Unfortunately, it apparently looks much more like a medieval cog.
