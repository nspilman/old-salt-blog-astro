Here on the west bank of the Hudson, we were in the path of Hurricane Sandy’s storm surge and winds. Though we came very close to flooding we didn’t quite go under. (We were very lucky.) We are have food, water and shelter. All we lack is phone, electricity and internet. So untill the lights go on, I will be difficult to contact. I have posts cued up for the next few days and wish everyone a good week.
