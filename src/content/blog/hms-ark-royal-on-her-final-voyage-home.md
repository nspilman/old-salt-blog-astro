*Gliding silently through the fog, HMS Ark Royal – the pride of the fleet – came home for the final time this morning.*

*As the fog began to clear the full majesty of the ship’s 23,000-ton bulk was revealed to the hundreds of well-wishers who had gathered to welcome the grey leviathan back to the place where it all began.*

*The fifth ship to carry the Ark Royal name, the Invincible-class carrier has been scrapped three years early in the name of efficiency.*

*Ark Royal was the biggest casualty of the defence review – quite literally.*

*She is the largest warship in the Royal Navy and, although the Sea Harriers that gave her such a powerful punch have already gone, she can still provide air support for British forces anywhere in the world.*

*As the ship moved on down the Tyne today spectators waved their final goodbyes.*

*Some had built the giant warship at the Swan Hunter yard.*

*One man, his eyes filled with tears, stood on the banks and said: “I built her so I couldn’t miss saying goodbye. It seems unbelieve that this will be the final time I she her.*

*“She gave us all such pride. The Ark was a symbol of what we were capable of here in the North-East. It’s an appalling mistake to take her out of service.”*

*The decision to cull the Ark Royal three years ahead of time will leave the Navy without a fixed wing aircraft carrier for the rest of the decade.*
