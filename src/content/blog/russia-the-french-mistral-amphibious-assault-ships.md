![mistral class](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mistral-class.jpg)Back in 2010, [we posted that some members of NATO](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/02/french-warship-sales-to-russia-worries-allies/) were uncomfortable with a French contract to build two, with an option for two more, [Mistral-class amphibious assault ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral-class_amphibious_assault_ship) for Russia.  The first ship, the *Vladivostok*, was supposed to be delivered to Russia in October but following Russian actions in the Ukraine, President François Hollande said France would postpone the delivery “[until further notice.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/world/europe/french-defense-minister-russia-mistral-warships.html?_r=0)”  The Russians are demanding that the French live up to the shipbuilding contract.  Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov said, “Everything is specified in the contract, and we will act under that contract, just like all civilized people do.”

France has received 1.2 billion euros from Russia so far, or more than half the contract price.  The *Vladivostok* is essentially complete while the second ship, the *Sevastopol*, was launched in November and was scheduled to be delivered in November 2015.  The Mistral class ships are capable of transporting and deploying 16 helicopters, four landing barges, up to 70 vehicles including 13 tanks, or a 40-strong tank battalion, and 450 soldiers.

Some in the Russian military say that it doesn’t matter is the ship are delivered. [Global Security](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/mistral.htm) quotes Adm. Vladimir Komoedov, chairman of the defense committee of the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, speaking on 03 September 2014. “This will not undermine our combat readiness because this ‘tin can’ will require a lot of getting used to, and will most likely come without a control system; and we don’t really need a helicopter carrier vessel.”
