*Responding to a question in Parliament, Marine Affairs Minister Yiannis Diamantidis said that the government cannot afford to remove the ship’s hulk.*

*“The ministry cannot raise this shipwreck,” he said. “We do not have the finances to do it as it will cost more than 150 million euros and this is an issue that the shipowner and insurance company have to deal with.”*

*Louis Cruise Lines, which owned the ship, has firmly rejected any responsibility for the sinking.*
