On July 30, 1942, Herbert Claudius in command of the patrol boat PC 566 was escorting passenger ship passenger ship Robert E. Lee in the Gulf of Mexico, southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River. The German U-boat U-166 attacked and sank the passenger ship. Claudius and PC 566 fought back with gun fire and depth charges. They saw oil and debris and thought that they had sunk the German submarine, but they Navy did not believe their report.

Now 72 years later, a National Geographic/NOVA expedition located the wreck of U-166 which indeed had been sunk by Captain Claudius and the PC 566. The Navy has admitted its error. As reported by [National Geographic](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/12/141217-german-u-boat-u-166-gulf-mexico-archaeology-history/): *“Seventy years later, we now know that \[Claudius’s\] report after the action was absolutely correct,” Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said in a small ceremony attended by members of Claudius’s family.*

*“\[Claudius’s ship\] did sink that U-boat, and it’s never too late to set the record straight,” Mabus said, as he presented the late captain with a posthumous Legion of Merit with a Combat “V” device, which recognizes heroism in battle.*

*Claudius’s son, Gordon Claudius, accepted the medal and said that he wished his father could have known about the correction to a largely forgotten chapter in American history. Claudius passed away in 1981, after a 33-year career in the Navy.*
