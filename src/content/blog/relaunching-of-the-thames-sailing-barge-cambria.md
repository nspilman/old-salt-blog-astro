The reconstruction is nearing its completion. Tomorrow, Monday 21st March, 2011, the *Cambria* will be relaunched into Faversham Creek, and move downstream to Iron Wharf to complete fitting-out.

The only sad note to the otherwise happy occasion, is that the future of the apprentice program at  [Standard Quay](http://standardquay.com/), where the *Cambria* was rebuilt, is now  in doubt.  From the [Standard Quay MARCH 20, 2011 website](http://standardquay.com/):

*The apprenticeship scheme is now in severe danger as, rather than being now firmly established with the apprentices continuing to work on other large wooden vessels in desperate need of the skills they have learned, the doubtful future of Standard Quay has led to the work being halted. Projects already booked in to the dry docks will keep them busy until the middle of June, but after that, the future looks bleak.The apprenticeship scheme is now in severe danger as, rather than being now firmly established with the apprentices continuing to work on other large wooden vessels in desperate need of the skills they have learned, the doubtful future of Standard Quay has led to the work being halted.
