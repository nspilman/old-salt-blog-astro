![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/An-armed-Somali-pirate.-006.jpg)The son of a fisherman, who moved on to selling khat, Saeed Yare became a pirate only two years ago and  “earned” over $2.4 million in 2010 in ransom of ships and crews.  It is estimated that [piracy is inflicting a $12-billion toll on the global economy](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/economy-lab/daily-mix/pirates-inflict-12-billion-toll-on-global-economy/article1936662/).

[Somali pirate: I made $2.4 mln from ransoms in 2010](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/10/uk-somalia-piracy-idUSLNE72906Q20110310?pageNumber=1)  
  
*Only two years after deciding to join in the piracy rampant off the Somalian coast, Saeed Yare is a dollar multi-millionaire.*

*“It is not an easy job being a pirate. You gamble with your life, but I enjoy being a piracy tycoon,” says the slim 27-year-old, dressed in a sharp suit he says is Italian.*

*“The piracy business is like a presidential seat, you don’t want to give it up once you taste its sweetness. A friend of mine died in the recent navy operation — but he left one million dollars!” Yare said, referring to a botched rescue attempt that left four U.S. citizens dead.*

*Yare said he made $2.4 million in 2010: $1.2 million for investing in the venture that led to the hijacking of the British-flagged Asian Glory, another $700,000 for Saudi tanker Al Nisr Al Saudi and $500,000 for Bulgarian vessel Panega.*

*“I earned more cash after investing in two operations and personally participating in a separate hijacking, all were successful,” he said.*

*“I spent some of the cash on weapons, private bodyguards, luxury cars, trucks, a boat and three villas. And I still have enough to use until another ship is hijacked.”*

*Armed pirate gangs have made millions of dollars striking at ships in the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean, as far south as the Seychelles islands and eastwards towards India.*

*Yare abandoned a lucrative trade in khat, a sure-fire route to amassing riches in the Horn of Africa country, when he saw former fishermen getting even richer by piracy.*

*He befriended a pirate who advised him to “invest” $80,000 to help carry out a hijacking and expect a 50 percent return of $120,000 once ransom was paid.*

*“I got inspired to be a pure pirate in 2009. First, I set off into the sea with them and captured a Saudi oil tanker that made us lick our fingers — a hell of a lot of cash!*”
