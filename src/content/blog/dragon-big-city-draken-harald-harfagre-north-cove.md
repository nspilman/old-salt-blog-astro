Yesterday, I had the opportunity to go aboard the 115 foot long [Draken Harald Hårfagre](http://www.drakenexpeditionamerica.com/), the largest Viking ship built in modern times, currently docked in Manhattan’s North Cove.  Here are a few photos of her arrival and at dockside.

That evening evening, I had the pleasure of attending a presentation at the [Explorers Club](https://explorers.org/) by Sigurd Aase, the ship’s owner, and by Captain Björn Ahlander, master of the ship on her voyage to America. The Viking longship sailed from Haugesund in late April in an epic voyage across the Atlantic. With a crew of 32, from 10 nations, the ship encountered gales, icebergs, and bitter cold as they retraced the course that the Vikings sailed one thousand years ago.

The ship will be open for deck tours at North Cove Marina at Brookfield Place between 11AM and 6PM through Thursday, September 22th, as well as on Saturday, September 24th and Sunday, September 25th. New York is her last stop before sailing to Mystic, CT, where she will be laid up for the winter.
