![USS_Forrestal](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/10/USS_Forrestal.jpg)The first US Navy “[supercarrier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercarrier),” the [USS Forrestal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Forrestal_\(CV-59\)) was recently sold for scrap for the sum of one penny to the All Star Metals scrap yard in Beaumont, Texas. The Navy offered the carrier as a museum but did not receive any suitable applications. The ship is the first of three carriers scheduled to hit the scrapyard over the next few years. Built in Newport News Shipyard and commissioned in 1955, in her day she was the largest aircraft carrier ever built. Sadly, the ship is best known for a major fire and explosions on her flight deck in 1967 in which 134 sailors died and 161 were injured. Other serious fires in 1978 and 1989 earned her the nicknames, “Firestal”, “Forrestfire” and “USS Zippo.”

![USS_Zumwalt_(DDG-1000)](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/10/USS_Zumwalt_DDG-1000.jpg)At about the same time that the *Forrestal* was sent to scrap, Bath Iron Works in Maine floated [USS *Zumwalt*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Zumwalt_\(DDG-1000\)), the [first of three new high tech destroyers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zumwalt-class_destroyer). (The USS *Zumwalt*‘s scheduled christening was cancelled due to the recent US government shut-down and is being rescheduled for this spring.) If USS *Forrestal* was a “supercarrier” the USS *Zumwalt* may be a “superdestroyer,” and a super expensive one, at that.

USS *Zumwalt* is the largest, most technologically-advanced destroyer ever built. She is also by far the most costly. The ship itself cost $3.45 billion to built. Research and development cost, however, approached $10 billion. The average unit cost for the three ships, including R&D, is expected to be close to $7 billion.  In comparison, USS *Forrestal* cost $217 million in 1955. In current dollars, that would be roughly $1.9 billion.

The radical design of USS *Zumwalt*, which harkens back to monitors of the 19th century with tumblehome hulls and ram bows, has been controversial. The destroyer is designed with a wave-piercing hull, electric drive propulsion, advanced sonar and guided missiles, and a new gun that fires rocket-propelled warheads as far as 100 miles. The Zumwalt is also designed to have a significantly smaller radar signature. The ship is also believed to be suitable to be retrofit as a potential platform for futuristic weapons like the electromagnetic rail gun, which uses a magnetic field and electric current to fire a projectile at seven times the speed of sound.

The unconventional hull form has raised concerns about ship stability. The extremely high price of each ship has also resulted in the shipyard order being cut from an initial ten ships to the three currently under production. Defense Industry Daily Recently asked “[The USA’s DDG-1000 Zumwalt Class Program: Dead Aim, Or Dead End?](https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/dead-aim-or-dead-end-the-usas-ddg1000-zumwalt-class-program-02574/)” Only time will tell whether the new technology will prove effective and also cost effective.
