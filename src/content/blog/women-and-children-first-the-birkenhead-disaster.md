Where did the rule of loading women and children first into the lifeboats in an emergency come from? It is actually more of a guideline than a rule as it is not explicitly called out in admiralty law. It all dates from the sinking of [HM Troopship *Birkenhead*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Birkenhead_\(1845\)) in 1852, off the aptly named Danger Point, near Gansbaai, South Africa. A short video explanation from the “[History Guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4sEmXUuWIFlxRIFBRV6VXQ).”
