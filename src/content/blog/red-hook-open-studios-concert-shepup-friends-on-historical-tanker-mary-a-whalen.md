From [Portside NewYork’](https://portsidenewyork.org/calendar/2022/9/12/red-hook-open-studios-rhos-concert-shepup-amp-friends)s press release:

*Maritime and marinelife costumes encouraged during a night of music ranging from indie folk to Funk/hip hop aboard our historic oil tanker MARY A. WHALEN. The line-up is Sheila Flaherty (Shepup) and musicians Bloodman Steve, Annie Nirschel, and The Loosies curated by Shepup, a female marine engineer performing original songs written from her perspective as a mariner and human being.  Shepup will talk about how her experiences at sea influence her song writing and her work on the water. She invited the other musicians, reflecting the music community she developed from busking and open mics after moving to NYC to work on sewage tankers of the NYC Department of Environmental Protection.*
