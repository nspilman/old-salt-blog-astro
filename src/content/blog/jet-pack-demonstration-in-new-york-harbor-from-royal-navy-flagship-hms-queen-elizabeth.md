During [her recent visit to New York](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/09/flagship-hms-queen-elizabeth-arrives-in-new-york-to-host-atlantic-future-forum/) to host a two-day Anglo-American defense conference, the Royal Navy flagship [HMS *Queen Elizabeth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Queen_Elizabeth_\(R08\)) was used in a training demonstration in the harbor using jet packs.

The [BBC reports](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-hampshire-63198645) that the Sussex-based jet suit developer [Gravity Industries](https://gravity.co/) has been working with Royal Marines Commandos to explore how personnel may be able to use its systems to move between ships and the shore or board suspicious vessels. The test was carried out by former Royal Marine Reservists from the deck of the aircraft carrier.
