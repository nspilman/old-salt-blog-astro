![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/07/mscflaminia-125x54.jpg)The Smit 16,320-hp ocean going tug *Fairmount Expedition* has reportedly been successful in controlling the spread of the fire on the MSC *Flaminia,* the  6,732 TEU container ship which was abandoned in middle of the North Atlantic last Sunday after suffering a fire and an explosion. The *Fairmount Expedition* was joined last night by a second salvage tug, the 16,500-hp *Anglian Sovereign*.  A third tug,  the 10,880-hp *Carlo Magno*, is expected to arrive around mid-day Sunday to assist with the firefighting.

[Smit’s salvage master has reported that the MSC *Flaminia’*s hull appears to be intact](http://www.tradewindsnews.com/casualties/280522/salvors-to-board-msc-flaminia) and that the deckhouse, engine room and after hatches do not appear to have been damaged by the fire and explosion.  Nevertheless, he estimates that it could take several weeks to bring the fire under control.  There are plans to board the ship this week end and to attempt to ship’s firefighting system.

[Twenty survivors of the fire and explosion arrived in Falmouth](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-18897929) yesterday aboard the VLCC *DS Crown.*  Three injured crew were transferred to the container ship *MSC Stella* and are now being treated in the Azores.  One crew member died in the explosion on the MSC *Flaminia* and one is still missing.
