![hermionebelayingpin1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hermionebelayingpin1.jpg)Within a few hours after the replica French [frigate *l’Hermione*](http://www.hermione2015.com/) set sail on her maiden voyage to the United States, friends stopped by our house on the west side of the Hudson River for drinks and brought an unexpected gift. They had recently returned from France and brought back a belaying pin. But not just any belaying pin. The pin has a brass plate attached which reads “*L’Hermione,  La Frégate de la Liberté.*”  The tag also reads: “*Ce cabillot servi à bord de la frégate de XII l’Hermione lors des essais en mer de l’automne 2014*” (This belaying pin served aboard the frigate Hermione XII during the tests at sea Autumn 2014.)

So at least part of *l’Hermione* has arrived before the ship itself. Thank you so much, Sheridan and Sylvie.
