Typhoon Haiyan survivors on Sunday pass by two vessels that were washed ashore during the storm in Tacloban, a city in Leyte, a province in the central Philippines.

In the aftermath of Super Typhoon Haiyan, the Philippines is beginning to attempt to cope with what has been described as the worst natural disaster in its history.  The typhoon hit the archipelago with winds approaching 200 mph and drove a storm surge which leveled cities and villages. More than 10,000 are fear to have been killed.  Damaged and obstructed roads have hampered the distribution of aid to hundreds of thousands who lack food, water and shelter.
