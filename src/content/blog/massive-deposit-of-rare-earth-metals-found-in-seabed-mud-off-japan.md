![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rareeasrthisland.jpg)Researchers have located [huge deposits of rare-earth metals](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23948-5.pdf) in seabed mud off the Japanese island [Minamitorishima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minami-Tori-shima), located 1,150 miles southeast of Tokyo. The discovery could have a major impact on both the Japanese and the world economy. Rare-earth metals are essential to modern technologies and are used in smartphones, hybrid vehicles, rechargeable batteries, wind turbines, light emitting diodes, compact fluorescent lamps, screen display panels, and many medical and military technologies.

In recent years, China has had a near monopoly on the production of rare-earth metals, extracting [85 to 95 percent of the world’s rare-earth metal supply](https://www.seeker.com/tech/materials/chinas-monopoly-on-rare-earth-elements-tightens-with-purchase-of-us-mine) from large clay deposits in the country’s south. Despite their name, [rare earth metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_element) are actually not particularly rare although they are difficult to find in deposits from which they can be economically extracted. 

The [discovery of the rare-earth deposits](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/16/asia/japan-rare-earth-metals-find-china-economy-trnd/index.html) off Japan is being described as “[game-changer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-hopes-rare-earth-find-will-give-it-an-edge-against-china-1523446948?ns=prod/accounts-wsj).”  In a paper published last week, the new deposits may contain a “semi-infinite” supply of rare-earth materials. Specifically, they estimate that there maybe 780 years worth of yttrium, 620 years worth of europium, 420 years worth of terbium, and 730 years worth of dysprosium, in the mud of the Japanese deposits.
