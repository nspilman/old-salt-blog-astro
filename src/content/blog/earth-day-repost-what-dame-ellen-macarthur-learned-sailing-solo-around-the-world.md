![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dameellen.jpg)I realize that I am in a rut. Every Earth Day, I say the same thing. Over 70% of the surface of this planet is covered by water, so referring to the planet as “earth” is just wrong. But be that as it may, the misnamed planet is still called “earth” and Earth Day is a worthwhile celebration of protecting the planet, both the dirt and the watery portions. 

Below is a repost of a TED talk by one of the world’s great sailors, Dame Ellen MacArthur, about what she learned when she was sailing around the world alone. As she circled the globe, she began thinking about the idea of “the circular economy,” an intriguing insight. Definitely worth watching.
