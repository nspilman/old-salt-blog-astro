Workers from New York’s Central Park Conservancy were removing rust from a cannon originally from the British 28 gun frigate HMS *Hussar*, which sank in New York’s East River in 1780.  After removing a concrete plug from the mouth of the cannon, they were shocked to realize that the gun was still loaded with round shot, wadding and a cartridge of powder. The cannon had been donated to the city in 1865 and had been on display before being moved to a shed in Central Park for safe keeping.  Almost, though not quite, a “blast from the past.”

Somehow it doesn’t seem surprising that the ship in question is the HMS *Hussar.*  Shortly after the *Hussar* sank after hitting Pot Rock in Hell Gate in 1780, a rumor emerged that the ship was carrying gold to pay British troops in Rhode Island.  There appears to be no documentation anywhere that there was gold aboard the ship but that has not stopped treasure hunters from searching for the past two hundred plus years.  To learn more see “[The Endless Search for the HMS Hussar”: New York’s Legendary Treasure Shipwreck](http://www.amazon.com/The-Endless-Search-Hms-Hussar/dp/0962991325/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358178032&sr=8-1&keywords=hms+hussar) by Robert Apuzzo.
