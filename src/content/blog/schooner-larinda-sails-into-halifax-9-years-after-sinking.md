The 86′ schooner [*Larinda*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larinda) sank in Halifax harbor during [Hurricane Juan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Juan) on September 29, 2003.   She was raised from the harbor bottom and following a nine year restoration has returned to Halifax for this year’s [Tall Ship Festival](http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/NovaScotiaBeaches/tallships2012.aspx).

The design and construction of the schooner are highly distinctive. The hull was modeled after *[HMS Sultana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Sultana),* a Royal Navy schooner built in the years prior to the American Revolution.  The *Larinda*, however, is not quite a replica.   The schooner has a 2,800-square-foot junk rig and the hull is built of ferro-cement.  Also, below decks, the schooner is powered by a historic1928 eight ton 100 HP Wolverine diesel engine, thought to be [one of only two still operating](http://www.oldtacomamarine.com/other/cama.html). From her frog figurehead to her broad stern, the *Larinda* is unique.
