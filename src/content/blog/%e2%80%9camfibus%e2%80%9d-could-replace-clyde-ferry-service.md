![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/amfibus.jpg)This September, we posted about the popular and nearly ubiquitous “duck tours” using refurbished World War II DUKW amphibious trucks, or vehicles inspired by them, to take tourists on tours in cities and resorts around the world. (See [From DUKWs to Ducks, Ducks and More Ducks](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/09/07/from-dukw-to-ducks-ducks-and-more-ducks/).)  Now an English bus company is testing an “amfibus,” a Dutch amphibious bus, as a possible replacement for a ferry service across the Clyde River, which is scheduled to be shut down this March.  After fixing a technical glitch, testing has resumed and everything looks just ducky. (Sorry.)
