Damage to the bow of the Pacific Star after a storm in 2007 resulting in a cancelled cruise

The video of unsecured furniture flying about on the P&O cruise ship, [](http://www.pocruises.com.au/ourships/pages/pacificsun.aspx)*[Pacific Sun](http://www.pocruises.com.au/ourships/pages/pacificsun.aspx)*, is all over the internet.  A Carnival spokesperson ([Carnival](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=140690&p=irol-index) owns P&O) is quoted as saying, “*The incident was fully investigated and lessons learnt have been heeded, including the securing of tables and other furnishings aboard*.”   As Captain D. Peter Boucher commented on [our previous post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/09/08/po-cruise-ship-pacific-sun-in-heavy-seas-alarming-video/), “the lessons were learned hundreds of years ago by seafarers,” as indeed they were.   There is, however, more to this story  than initially meets the eye.  
  
It appears that this was not just a case of cruise line learning a very basic lesson in seamanship, but rather a repeat performance of a lesson wholly unlearned.   The *Pacific Sun* was caught in a storm off Vanuatu at the end of July in 2008.  Carnival spokesman David Johns said, “*A series of waves buffeted the ship, having an impact for people onboard… This was an exceptionally rare occurrence.”*

Apparently not so rare.  Almost exactly a year before, the *Pacific Star*, a sister-ship to the *Pacific Sun*, was caught in a storm also just off Vanuatu and was sufficiently damaged that the cruise had to be cancelled.   Fortunately, no passengers were seriously injured on the *Star.* Unfortunately for passengers of the *Pacific Sun,* apparently nothing was learned from the damage to the *Star.*

One might understand, if not necessarily excuse,  how objects which are required to move about, chairs, for example, might not be properly secured.  It was reported on the *Pacific Sun,* however, that some of *“the worst injuries were caused when gambling machines crashed over on top of people.*”   It is difficult to imagine any justification why large gaming machines in a casino would not be properly secured for sea, particularly on a winter cruise in waters where a sister-ship suffered cruise ending damage in a storm only the year before.

But why is this story and video coming to the surface now?  One of the women in the video being battered by flying furniture is now suing the cruise line.  The company claims that the “*drama happened during very unusual weather.”* That would be the same sort of unusual weather as damaged the *Pacific Star* in the same waters only a year before?
