Last Friday, the [US District Court in San Francisco issued a warrant](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11413901) to seize Oracle Team USA’s prototype America’s Cup foiling multihull sail boat, in response to a lien filed by New Zealand sailor Joe Spooner, whose contract was terminated in January. Spooner is a New Zealander who was a grinder with Oracle Team USA during its America’s Cup victories in 2010 and 2013. He was hired for the upcoming America’s Cup series at a salary of $25,000 per month.  The dispute is, in part, over the terms of his work visa which Spooner’s lawyer claimed required him to be working under a fixed-term contract, while Oracle argued that Spooner had an at-will contract.  They also claimed that Spooner was fired after asking for a raise to $38,000 per month to cover the expense of relocating to Bermuda.

Without having an opinion of the outcome of the lawsuit, it serves as a reminder of the cost of professional yachting these days. In the last America’s Cup, [costs to mount a challenge averaged around $100 million](http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2013/09/26/cost-compete-34th-americas-cup/) with Oracle spending between $250 – $500 million to defend the cup.  And from the current lawsuit, we learn that the going rate for a sailor to grind the winches is at least $300,000 per year.

This is not meant to be as a criticism of Mr. Spooner or other professional sailors. He is a professional athlete and is being paid the going rate for professional sailors. Compared to athletes in sports leagues, professional sailors are only modestly compensated. The [average salaries for the NBA, MLB, NHL, and the NFL](http://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2012/12/07/average-player-salaries-in-the-four-major-american-sports-leagues/) are $5.15, $3.2, $2.4 and $1.9 million dollars per player per year, respectively. On the other hand, attorneys average salaries around $150,000 per year, while mechanical engineers earn, on average, around $80,000.

Wage disputes between rich yacht owners and their professional crews are not new either. Shortly before sailing to compete in the 1934 America’s Cup in his yacht [*Endeavour*,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/02/j-boat-endeavour-an-amazing-survivor-of-another-age/) Tommy Sopwith’s entire crew went on strike over a wages. Sopwith was able to round up what was described as “[a crew of eager amateurs.](http://royalcorinthian.co.uk/endeavour/1934-americas-cup/)” Sopwith sailing the *Endeavour* went on to win the first two cup races but lost the series. The consensus was that his amateurs crew let him down.
