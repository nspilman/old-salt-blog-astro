As of Monday evening, local time, 478 passengers and crew have been rescued from the burning ro/ro ferry [*Norman Atlantic*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Norman_Atlantic), [which caught fire Sunday morning around 6 AM in the Adriatic Sea](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/12/italian-roro-ferry-norman-atlantic-on-fire-in-high-winds-seas-in-adriatic/).  At least 7 people have died.  Many of the passengers and crew were evacuated by helicopter.  The rescue was hampered by torrential rain and strong winds reaching 100 kilometers per hour.  As reported by [CNN:](http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/28/world/europe/ferry-fire-italy-greece/) *It’s not known how the fire started, but it’s believed to have originated in the parking bay. A truck driver told the Greek news media that trucks filled with oil were “packed like sardines,” their cargo scraping the ceiling, which could have set off sparks in rough seas to start a fire, he surmised. Greek authorities said the vessel’s fire doors appeared to have failed, which allowed the flames to spread quickly.*
