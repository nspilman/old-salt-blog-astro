![spanishseamonster1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/spanishseamonster1.jpg)It is around 13 feet long, appears to have horns and stinks to high heaven.  A carcass washed ashore on Luis Siret Beach in Villaricos, Spain which is being widely referred to a “[sea monster](http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/08/22/horned-sea-monster-washes-ashore-spain-baffles-officials-150984).”  Perhaps a bit small to be truly monstrous, the stench, nevertheless, was reported to be sufficiently foul to justify burying the beast.  On further examination, what were reported to be horns appear to be dislocated bones.  Samples are being taken to local laboratories to try to get a better idea what he creature may have been.

Some experts suggest that the carcass is that of a [thresher shark](http://www.nbcnews.com/science/horned-sea-monster-its-definitely-shark-skeleton-6C10971972).  Another likely possibility could be a *Regalecus glesne*, a [giant oar fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_oarfish), the world’s longest bony fish, which can grow to 35 feet in length, though there have been unconfirmed sighting of oar fish reaching 56 feet long.   Giant oarfish swim in most oceans of the world, primarily in the [mesopelagic layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopelagic), ranging as deeply as 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) up to 20 metres (66 ft).  Many sighting of “sea serpents” may have been rare surface sightings of giant oar fish.  Oddly, the giant oar fish is also called the “king of herrings.”  While the oar fish may qualify as a sea monster based on appearance and length, it has no teeth and eats mostly krill.

There is numerous photos of oar fish that have been caught or died and washed ashore including a photo, below, of a 26′ foot long oar fish being help by a group of Navy Seals in 1996.
