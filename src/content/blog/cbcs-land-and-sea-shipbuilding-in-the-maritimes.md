Last week, [we posted about the documentary “Shipbuilding in the Maritimes](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/12/maritime-shipbuilding-on-cbcs-land-sea/),” which aired on Sunday on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s [*Land and Sea*](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/). For those of us who do not get the programming on  television, the CBC is good enough to post the *Land and Sea* programs on line. “Shipbuilding in the Maritimes,” a half hour documentary on the once-thriving shipbuilding centers in Atlantic Canada, is embedded below.  Worth a look.
