The [minesweeper USS *Guardian* ran aground](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/01/minesweeper-uss-guardian-runs-aground-on-reef-in-philippines-tubbataha-national-marine-park/) on a reef at the Tubbataha  marine park in the Sula Sea last Thursday.  The ship is still there. So far there has been no reported leaks of fuel leaks though the [Navy has confirmed that multiple spaces aboard the ship have been flooded](http://www.navytimes.com/news/2013/01/dn-stranded-navy-minesweeper-taking-on-water-012013/).  The worsen weather may threaten the salvage of the ship. The north east monsoon winds known as the [Amihan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amihan) are expected to worsen over the next few days.

[As reported by GMA News](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/291425/news/nation/time-running-out-for-uss-guardian-in-tubbataha-as-amihan-winds-intensify): *“The strong northeasterly wind and the associated big waves could affect any operation to rescue the US vessel. One thing to consider is there is another surge of the northeast monsoon this week, so expect stronger winds and heavier seas,” GMA News’ resident meteorologist Nathaniel “Mang Tani” Cruz said.*
