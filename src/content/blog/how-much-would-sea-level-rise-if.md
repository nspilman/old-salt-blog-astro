![ships](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ships.jpg)How much would sea levels fall if all ships were removed all at once from the oceans of the world?  Far less than you might think.

To put this in content, according to [UNCTAD](http://unctad.org/en/Docs/rmt2011ch2_en.pdf), in January 2011, there were over 100,000 seagoing commercial ships in service, with a combined capacity of around 1.4 billion deadweight tons. According to calculations run by the “[What if](http://what-if.xkcd.com/33/) ” website, if all the worlds ships were to be removed at the same time, the sea level of the worlds’ oceans would fall by “about six microns—slightly more than the diameter of a strand of spider silk.”  [Click here to read more.](About six microns—slightly more than the diameter of a strand of spider silk.)  Thanks to Brooks Rowlett for pointing out the article on the MarHist list.
