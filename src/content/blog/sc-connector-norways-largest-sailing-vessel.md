![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/01/scconnector.jpg)[Sea-Cargo](https://sea-cargo.no/) now has bragging rights to the claim that their 12,251 gross tonne ro-ro, [*SC Connector*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/SC-CONNECTOR-IMO-9131993-MMSI-256149000), is “[Norway’s largest sailing vessel](https://sea-cargo.no/norways-largest-sailing-vessel/).” The ship was recently refit with two rotor sails by [Norsepower](https://www.norsepower.com/post/norsepower-installs-first-tiltable-rotor-sails-on-sea-cargo-ro-ro/) and battery banks from [Norwegian Electric Systems](https://www.norwegianelectric.com/). The ro-ro now has taller masts and greater tonnage than the Norwegian sail training ship, [*Statsraad Lehmkuhl*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statsraad_Lehmkuhl), which can still claim the title of the “[largest three masted barque from Norwa](https://www.navalbasecruises.com/news/worlds-largest-three-masted-barque-from-norway-makes-return-visit-to-norfolk/#:~:text=The%20Barque%20'Statsraad%20Lehmkuhl'%20is,oldest%20and%20largest%20sailing%20vessel.)y.”

Perhaps the most interesting thing about the [*SC Connector*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/SC-CONNECTOR-IMO-9131993-MMSI-256149000), is how it succeeds in navigating under bridges and powerlines with its new 35-meter tall rotor sail rig. This is not a new problem. On May 11, 1878, for example, [the US Navy training ship USS *Minnesota* lost the tip of her main top-gallant mast](https://turnstiletours.com/the-brooklyn-bridge-and-the-brooklyn-navy-yard-too-close-for-comfort/) when she struck one of the suspension cables strung between the bridge towers of the still-under-construction Brooklyn Bridge.

*SC Connector* sails between Western Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and, also, Sweden and Poland, and transits under multiple bridges and powerlines. Norsepower and Sea-Cargo developed a design for rotor sails that tilt to almost horizontal when required. The rig is designed for the extreme conditions in the North Sea and allows the rotors to be raised and lowered while sailing.

When in operation, the rotor sails are expected to achieve a fuel consumption, fuel cost, and carbon emissions reduction of up to 25%. In good wind conditions, the sailing vessel will maintain regular service speed by sail alone. Norsepower’s Rotor Sail Solution is a modern version of the [Flettner rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flettner_rotor), a spinning cylinder that uses the Magnus effect to harness wind power to propel a ship.
