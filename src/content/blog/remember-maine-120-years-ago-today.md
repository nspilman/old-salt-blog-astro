![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/USSMaine1.jpg)One hundred and twenty years ago today, on February 15, 1898, a mysterious explosion ripped through the hull of the American battleship USS *Maine,* at anchor in Havana harbor in Cuba. The ship sank killing 266 of the 350 men aboard. The loss of the USS *Maine* heightened the tension between the United States and Spain. Cuba was a Spanish colony and the island was gripped in a rebellion against Spain. USS *Maine* was in Havanna to protect U.S. interests.  

It was widely assumed at the time that the Spanish had placed a mine or launched a torpedo which sank the ship.  The American press whipped up the  American public with the slogan, “[*Remember*](http://www.ushistory.org/us/44c.asp) *the Maine. The Hell with Spain.*”  After initially attempting to continue with ongoing diplomacy, the US declared war on Spain on April 25, 1898. By August, Spain had ceded Cuba, along with the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Guam, to the United States.

While the sinking of the USS *Maine* helped in the US’s progression towards war with Spain, to this day, no one is entirely sure what caused the explosion. There have been at least six public and private investigations into the sinking which have reached contradictory conclusions. 

The Spanish inquiry found no evidence of a mine and concluded that the most likely cause was the spontaneous combustion in the coal bunker, located adjacent to the munition stores in *Maine.*

American inquiries in 1898 and 1911, each concluded that a mine had sunk the ship. In 1974, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover began a new investigation. Based on new engineering analysis, Rickover’s team agreed with the Spanish that the most likely cause was a spontaneous combustion in the coal bunker. 

Private investigations sponsored by National Geographic and the Discovery Channel in 1998 and 2002, respectively yielded mixed results. The National Geographic investigation was inconclusive, developing evidence for an internal explosion in the coal bunker and an external blast from a mine.  The Discovery Channel investigation sided with Rickover and the Spanish, that a bunker explosion was the most likely cause.

A final conspiracy theory is that the US sank its own warship to trigger a conflict with Spain.  Like so many conspiracy theories, it is unsupported by any real evidence.

Between 1910 and 1912, the wreckage of the USS Maine was raised from Havanna harbor by the US Army Corps of Engineers. The remaining 66 bodies of lost crew were removed for burial. On March 16, 1912, *Maine* was towed four miles from the Cuban coast and sunk.
