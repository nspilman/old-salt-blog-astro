The [John B. Caddell](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/12/the-hurricane-sandy-pollution-response-unified-command-tackles-the-john-b-caddell/), 700 gross ton water tanker, that washed up on Front Street, in Staten Island, NY during Hurricane Sandy a month and a half ago, is back in the water.  In a team effort lead by the Coast Guard in coordination with least eight state, local and federal agencies, the tanker was hoisted and hauled off the road and rocky beach and back into the water by Donjon Marine using the Chesapeake 1000  crane barge, reported to be one of the largest on the East Coast.  The [Staten Island Advance](http://photos.silive.com/4499/gallery/tanker_washed_aground_in_hurricane_sandy/index.html) has a wonderful gallery of the before, during and after shots of the tanker salvage:
