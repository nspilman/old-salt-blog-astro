![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/renaoilship.jpg)Attempts to pump out the residual fuel of from the *[MV Rena](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/05/mv-rena-aground-on-astrolabe-reef-off-tauranga-new-zealand/)*, stranded on Astrolabe Reef off New Zealand continue with mixed results.  [New focus for Rena salvagers](http://www.3news.co.nz/New-focus-for-Rena-salvagers/tabid/1160/articleID/230951/Default.aspx)

Today, a second container ship, the *Schelder Trader,* lost power and drifted onto the north-west rocks at the entrance to Tauranga Harbour not far from where the *MV Rena* ran aground.   The *Schelder Trader* was freed without incident.  (Thanks to Dirk Bal for the heads up.)  [Another container ship in trouble off Tauranga, refloated after hitting rocks](http://auckland.scoop.co.nz/2011/10/another-container-ship-in-trouble-off-tauranga-refloated-after-going-aground/)

In the same hemisphere but a considerable distance away, this week, the Royal Australian Navy Patrol Boat, [*HMAS Broome*,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Broome_\(ACPB_90\)) is being credited with preventing an environmental and maritime catastrophe off Papua New Guinea overnight by providing assistance to the container ship, [MV *Vega Fynen*](http://www.vega-manila.com.ph/bulk-carrier-container-vessels/66), which had lost power and was drifting towards Ragelapra Reef, 100 nautical miles south-east of Port Moresby.  [HMAS Broome averts maritime disaster](http://www.defence.gov.au/defencenews/stories/2011/oct/1025b.htm)
