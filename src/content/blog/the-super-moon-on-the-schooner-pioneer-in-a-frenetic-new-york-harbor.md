“Supermoon” over the bow of Clipper City. Click for a larger image.

Last night, my wife and I took to a two hour sail on the [schooner *Pioneer*](http://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/visit/street-of-ships/pioneer/) to watch the “super moon” rise over New York harbor.   The “super moon,” is in scientific terms referred to as a “perigee moon,” a full moon at perigee, when the moon is closest to the earth.  This year we are having a [solid streak of “supermoons.”](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/10jul_supermoons/)  We had one last month on July 12th, one last night August 10th and will will have another on September 28th.   On nights with a “supermoon” the moon is roughly 14% larger and 30% brighter than other, non-super full moons. So, [supermoons are not really all that impressive](http://www.ibtimes.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-supermoon-astrophysicist-startalk-radio-says-its-slightly-bigger-moon-i-aint), but it was a beautiful night for a sail on the harbor.

Sailing in New York harbor on a summer evening is anything but a quiet and tranquil get-away. It is more like visiting a block party.  As the *Pioneer* pull away from the dock at Pier 16, a [Circle Line tour boat](http://www.circleline42.com/new-york-cruises/home.aspx) steamed by on the East River, joined by a large private yacht and a party boat, with a full upper deck of revelers. As we passed [Governor’s Island, we heard the booming beat from a concert](http://www.governorsbeachclub.com/events/Baauer--Boys-Noize) by Baauer & Boys Noize.  (I’ve never heard of them before, either.)  From the South, came a Staten Island ferry, while a bit in front of us toward the Brooklyn shore, the topsail schooner *[Clipper City](http://www.manhattanbysail.com/About-Us/Our-Boats/)* was also heading out to watch the moonrise.  In the distance against the Statue of Liberty, I could see that the schooner *[Shearwater](http://www.manhattanbysail.com/About-Us/Our-Boats/)* had proceeded us, while a few minutes later, the schooner [*America 2.0*](http://www.sail-nyc.com/schooner-america-2.0-sails) sailed by from up the Hudson.  Also in attendence was the 256′ long megayacht [*Amaryllis*](http://www.yachtcharterfleet.com/luxury-charter-yacht-25046/amaryllis.htm), at anchor just off the channel near the statue.  Water taxis and private power boats and sailboats were also all out, either to see the “supermoon” rise or just to enjoy the summer’s evening.

[South Street Seaport ‘s schooner *Pioneer*](http://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/visit/street-of-ships/pioneer/) is the perfect vessel to venture into the slightly frenetic New York harbor.  The 1885 schooner is lovely in its own right and the skilled captain and crew make navigating the crowded waters look easy.  Highly recommended.  The *Pioneer* will be sailing through September.
