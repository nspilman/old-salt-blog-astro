The statue of [Admiral Nelson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral_Horatio_Nelson) on the top of a [Nelson’s Column](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson's_Column) in Trafalgar Square is now sporting a fancy new hat featuring a Union Jack and an Olympic torch.  Nelson would have likely approved. He was known as a rather flashy dresser. Some have suggested that had he not worn his admiral’s [jacket with decorations](http://www.rmg.co.uk/server/show/conMediaFile.13769) at the [Battle of Trafalgar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar), his day might have ended somewhat better.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://alaricbond.com/) for passing the story along.
