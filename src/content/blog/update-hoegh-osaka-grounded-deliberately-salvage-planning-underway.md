The car carrier was deliberately grounded on Bramble Bank when the ship developed an unexplained list after leaving Southhampton.  [Ingar Skiaker, chief executive of Hoegh Autoliners, said](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-30673439), “*The captain and master and the pilot on board decided jointly to put the vessel on the sandbank to avoid any more serious problems. I think they executed their duties based on their best judgement and we’re not second-guessing their actions right now*.”

It is unclear how the salvage of the ship will proceed.  [BBC quoted marine salvage expert](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-30677320), Capt John Noble, who said: “*At the moment the door is wide open on how they will do it.  The tidal option is no longer possible as it is clear she is hard and fast where she is. It won’t be as complex as the Costa Concordia and they used a leverage system there, which has been used in a number of cases. It can’t be done using ballasts due to the angle but I am sure they are exploring the dredging option. This could be done as long as the seabed stays where it is, but Bramble Bank may wash back and forth. That could be a high risk option.* *The priority is making sure the fuel is safe and may well be removed, but the other issue is the hull giving way as she is in a position she is not designed for.”*

The ship is reported to be carrying 1,400 cars and 70 to 80 pieces of construction equipment, including 1,200 Jaguar Land Rovers and 65 Mini cars.
