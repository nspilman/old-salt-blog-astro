![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wheelterror.jpg)Recent video of the extremely well-preserved wreck of Franklin’s ship [*Terror*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Terror_\(1813\)) may shed new light on the many mysteries of Franklin’s lost expedition. 

In 1845, Captain Sir John Franklin departed England in command of two specially outfitted ships, [*Erebus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Erebus_\(1826\)) and *Terror*.  He was leading an Arctic expedition, intending to traverse the last unnavigated section of the Northwest Passage. Instead, the expedition of 139 simply disappeared. Numerous attempts were made to find and rescue Franklin and his party, but to no avail.

The wrecks of the *Erebus and Terror* were not located until almost 170 years later. The *Erebus* was found in 2014, south of King William Island in northern Canada. The *Terror* was found two years later close-by in, appropriately and coincidentally enough, [Terror Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_Bay). 

Recently, Parks Canada archaeologists used small remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) to peer deep inside the interior of the wreck of the *Terror*.  [National Geographic quotes](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/08/arctic-shipwreck-frozen-astounds-archaeologists/) [Ryan Harris](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/08/arctic-shipwreck-frozen-astounds-archaeologists/), the lead archaeologist on the project saying, “The ship is amazingly intact. You look at it and find it hard to believe this is a 170-year-old shipwreck. You just don’t see this kind of thing very often.” 

“There’s no obvious reason for *Terror* to have sunk,” says Ryan. “It wasn’t crushed by ice, and there’s no breach in the hull. Yet it appears to have sunk swiftly and suddenly and settled gently to the bottom. What happened?”

Teasing out the answers won’t be easy, even with such a bounty of artifacts. There are plans to excavate both wrecks, but it will be a slow process requiring years.

“Diving up here is extremely difficult,” says Ryan. “The water is extremely cold, making it impossible to stay down for very long, and the diving season is short—a few weeks if you’re lucky, a few days if you’re not.”

*Terror* was delivered in 1813 as a Vesuvius-class bomb vessel designed to carry large mortars. As HMS *Terror*, she participated in the [bombardment of Fort McHenry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Baltimore) in 1814. Bomb ships were heavily built and well suited to serve as expedition vessels in the Arctic. Franklin’s other ship, the *Erebus* also began her career as a bomb ship.

Here is a Parks Canada guided tour inside Franklin’s *Terror:*
