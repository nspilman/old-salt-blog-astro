![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/02/destoryerbell.jpg)In August 2022, [we posted that British divers had located](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/08/wreck-of-uss-jacob-jones-found-off-isles-of-scilly-first-us-destroyer-lost-to-enemy-action/) the wreck of the [USS *Jacob Jones*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Jacob_Jones_\(DD-61\)) in over 100 meters of water, 40 miles off the Isles of Scilly. The ship, a Tucker Class destroyer, was sunk during World War I by a German U-boat on December 6, 1917. USS *Jacob Jones* was the first US destroyer ever to be lost to enemy action and went down in 8 minutes. 64 of her crew of 110 were lost in the attack.

Now, the ship’s bell of the USS *Jacob Jones* has been recovered by the [Salvage and Marine Operations](https://des.mod.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hd-SALMO-Candidate-Pack.pdf) (SALMO) unit, a special salvage unit with the [United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense at the request of the US Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC)](https://www.history.navy.mil/news-and-events/news/2024/jacob-jones.html).

The command asked for assistance from the ministry’s SALMO unit “due to the risk of unauthorized and illegal salvaging,” retired Rear Adm. Sam Cox said in a statement. The shipwreck itself was first discovered off the Isles of Scilly, an archipelago off the southwestern coast of England, by the [Darkstar technical dive team](https://divernet.com/scuba-diving/how-darkstar-divers-found-destroyer-at-115m/) in August 2022.

The UK unit used a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to survey the site for long-term preservation and protection since the wreck’s discovery. 

The NHHC notes that the UK MOD’s SALMO team not only collected ROV video data and recovered the ship’s bell, but also placed a wreath and American flag on the wreck in tribute to the Sailors lost 107 years ago. After its recovery, the bell was placed into the temporary custody of Wessex Archaeology, a private firm contracted by NHHC. Later this year, after a ceremonial handover, the bell will be sent to the NHHC’s Underwater Archaeology Branch for conservation treatment and eventual display at the National Museum of the U.S. Navy.

*Jacob Jones* was in the second division of destroyers sent to Europe in May 1917, the month after the United States entered the war. The destroyers were assigned convoy escort duties to protect the Western Approaches to the United Kingdom and France from U-boat attacks that threatened the movement of food, weapons, and troops to the allies on the continent.
