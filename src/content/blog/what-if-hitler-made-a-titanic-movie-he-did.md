A wonderful post from John Edwards’  [Ocean Liners blog](http://oceanlinersblog.org/?p=1808).   Captain John asks the question, “what if Hitler made a Titanic movie? ”   He then answers it, “he did.”   A heavily fictionalized and equally anti-British version of the Titanic tragedy was made in Germany in 1942 and released in Paris in 1943.

[What if Hitler Made a Titanic Movie? (He Did)](http://oceanlinersblog.org/?p=1808)

Captain John writes:  *Unsurprisingly, it’s a propaganda film. To say the movie doesn’t quite stick to the facts and has its own unique point of view on the disaster is an understatement. But then, of course, what do you expect from Nazis?*

*The entire film is available for viewing on online. Watching the movie is not unlike sitting in the audience for Springtime for Hitler in that your jaw will likely be dropped open for the film’s entire length.*

Some background on the movie from [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036443/):

*After seeing this film, Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels thought the scenes of mass panic were not appropriate viewing for Germans, who were then being subjected to British bombing. So he allowed only foreign release, with the film premiering in Paris in 1943. Beginning in late 1949 Germans could see the film, but Allied powers forbade its showing in West Germany in 1950 because of its anti-British propaganda.*

*Dissatisfied with the scenario of the film [Titanic](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036443/),  Herbert [](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0783509/)Selpin  \[the movie’s director\] openly critised its writer Walter Zerlett-Olfenius and the whole German Navy. Goebbels had him arrested by the Gestapo. Selpin was found hung in his cell the following day. Suicide or murder?*

*Final Title Card: The deaths of 1,500 people remain unatoned for… an eternal condemnation of England’s quest for profit.*
