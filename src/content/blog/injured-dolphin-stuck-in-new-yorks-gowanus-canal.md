[Update: Dolphin Dies in Gowanus Canal](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/dolphin-in-gowanus-canal.html)

Crowds of onlookers gathered today in the bitter cold on the Union Street Bridge to see an apparently injured dolphin stuck in shallow water in New York’s [Gowanus Canal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowanus_Canal).  The canal is one of the most polluted areas in New York harbor due to a combination of industrial and sewage discharges, including heavy metals and other toxins.  The canal has recently been declared a [Superfund Site](http://www.epa.gov/region2/superfund/npl/gowanus/).   NYPD Harbor and Emergency Service units are on the scene as are marine biologists from the Riverhead Foundation. Right now they are waiting for high tide at 7PM this evening in hopes that the dolphin is capable of swimming out of the canal on its own.  Thanks to Phil Leon for contributing to the post.
