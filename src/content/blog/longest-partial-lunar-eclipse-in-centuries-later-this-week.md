![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/plunareclipse.jpg)On late Thursday, November 18, and early Friday, November 19, those watching the sky over much of the globe will see the longest partial lunar eclipse in almost 600 years. The eclipse will last for nearly 3 and a half hours and will be very near to, but not quite, a full lunar eclipse.

The eclipse will take place with a Beaver minimoon, so-called because the November moon is often colloquially called the Beaver moon and since the moon is also close to its apogee, or farthest point in its orbit, is slightly smaller in the sky and is referred to as a minimoon or micromoon.  Click here for [detailed times for the eclipse on the US East Coast](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/in/usa/new-york).
