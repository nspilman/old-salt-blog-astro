![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/363324741.jpg)An inflatable fishing boat has survived an attack by a 7 meter long great white shark off Strandfontein, South Africa. The fisherman were fishing for smooth hound sharks, which great whites consider to be very tasty. As reported by [IOL News](http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/fishing-boat-attacked-by-great-white-1.1239251): *One of the passengers had just pulled a smooth hound on to the boat when a great white stuck its head out of the water and took hold of the side of the boat. The shark bit down, puncturing the boat, held on and thrashed for over a minute.*  *The attack left a gash about half a metre long as well as a number of the shark’s teeth in the boat’s hull, which workers in Kalk Bay harbour admired on Monday.*

The inflatable boat, 8m long and 3m wide, and its seven passengers made it safely back to shore.  Thanks to Phil Leon for passing the article along.
