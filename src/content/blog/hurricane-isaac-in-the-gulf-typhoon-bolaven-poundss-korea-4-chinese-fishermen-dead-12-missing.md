One hell of a day for storms at sea. Just after noon today, [Isaac was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jpPhEgp9MGB6Ak30CL4HmYTiJlrw?docId=54270bd7e421427b9661eb26d8d3a1b2) as it slowly moved north in the Gulf of Mexico toward Louisiana and the city of New Orleans, on a track disturbingly similar to that taken by Hurricane Katrina seven years ago, which came ashore as Category 3 hurricane.

In the Pacific, [Typhoon Bolaven is pounding the Korean peninsula.](http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/28/world/asia/typhoon-bolave/index.html)  Five Chinese crew are confirmed drowned and twelve are still missing from two Chinese fishing vessels off Jeju Island, near the southern tip of the South Korean mainland.
