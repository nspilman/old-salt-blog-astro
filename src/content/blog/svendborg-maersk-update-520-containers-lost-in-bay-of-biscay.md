The initial reports that the *Svendborg Maersk* lost 200-300 containers in a storm on Friday in the Bay of Biscay have turned out to be optimistic. The number is now estimated to be around 520. 85% of the boxes lost were reported to be empty. This will, no doubt, significantly reduce the potential cargo claims to Maersk, but may increase the hazard to navigation to fishing and other vessels in the area, as empty boxes may take longer to sink that full containers. Maersk said none of the boxes contained dangerous goods.
