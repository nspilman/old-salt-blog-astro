*A German submarine from World War I has been discovered off the north coast of the Netherlands, where it sank in 1917, and will become an official war grave, the Royal Dutch Navy said Wednesday.*

*The U-106 was discovered in the North Sea, north of the Dutch island of Terschelling, in October 2009 by a Dutch naval ship mapping the sea floor, the navy said in a statement.*

*The find was not announced earlier because the German government needed time to find and inform the next-of-kin of the 41 crew who sank with the boat.*

*The submarine of 838 tonnes, 71.5 metres (234 feet) long, took to the water for the first time in July 1917, commanded by “Kapitänleutnant” Hans Hufnagel, fresh from submarine school.*
