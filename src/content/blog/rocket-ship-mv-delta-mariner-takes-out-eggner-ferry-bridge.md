![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/01/deltamariner.jpg)Last night around 8PM, the supply ship, *MV Delta Mariner,* operated by [Foss Maritime](http://www.foss.com/), struck the [Eggner Ferry Bridge](http://itouchmap.com/?d=491586&s=KY&f=bridge) on the Tennessee River in Kentucky, taking out a 300′ span.  The *MV Delta Mariner* is a 312-foot long and 8,000 horsepower supply ship,  designed to transport rocket booster cores for Boeing’s Delta IV rocket program. Four cars were on the bridge when the ship hit but there are no injuries reported on the bridge or aboard the ship.  The ship was not seriously damaged. The bridge normally handles around 2,800 cars per day.

The Coast Guard is investigating the cause of the crash, which may be related to high water levels on the river. The ship has passed under the bridge numerous times on its way from from the Boeing factory in Decatur, Alabama down the Tennessee-Tombigbee waterway to Mobile Bay and then on to launch stations in either Florida or California.   Thanks to Phil Leon for passing along the news.
