Preserved Fish

Puritans were notorious for [weird names](http://jezebel.com/these-puritan-names-from-1888-are-the-best-worst-names-1322135371).  Some first names are strangely long, such as “If-Christ-had-not-died-for-thee-thou-hadst-been-damned” or “Fight-the-good-fight-of-faith”.  Some names were short but just disturbingly odd. Fly-fornication, for example.  In 1766, [Preserved Fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preserved_Fish) was born in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. His first name, Preserved, pronounced “pre-SER-vedd” is thought to be a shortening of “Preserved in Grace” or “Preserved from Sin.”

As a young man, Preserved shipped out on a whaling ship on a voyage to the Pacific. At 21, he became a whaling ship captain. When he came ashore, he became a successful merchant in first New Bedford and then New York City.  He founded the shipping firm,  Fish & Grinnell.  He later became one of the 28 brokers of the New York Exchange Board, which later became the [New York Stock Exchange](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange) and also became a director of Bank of America.  He also served until his death as President of the Tradesman’s Bank.  His family, which remained prominent in New York, also gave rise to [Hamilton Fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Fish), governor, senator, and secretary of state, and [Stuyvesant Fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_Fish), a notable railroad president.

Preserved Fish has not entirely been forgotten.  Singer/songwriter Ken Ficara immortalizes Preserved Fish with a song by the same name.  The lyrics are below.  [Click here to listen to Ken singing his song](http://www.kenficara.com/song.php?song=fish&group=default).

He was a merchant and a banker; his ships rode at anchor  
In the harbor; he had fortune and fame  
He lunched on Wall Street with the gentry  
In the early 19th century  
But he had a most unfortunate name

Preserved Fish, did you ever wish  
More than your name had gone down in history?  
Oh Preserved, what’d you do to deserve it?  
To have a name that caused you so much misery?

You went to school with students  
Named Patience and Prudence  
But their religious names were not so odd  
You were preserved from sin, preserved in grace  
But not preserved from your classmates  
You must have suffered hard in that schoolyard.

Preserved Fish, did you ever wish  
That your name didn’t bring to mind sardines?  
Oh Preserved, what’d you do to deserve it?  
How could your Quaker parents be so mean?

Nowadays we’re just as bad  
We name our kids for the latest fad  
We didn’t learn a single thing from you  
We’ve got parents who just can’t spell  
We’ve got a dumb blonde named for a French hotel  
What’s a poor little kid supposed to do?

Preserved Fish, did you ever wish  
For a name that didn’t sound like pickled herring?  
Oh Preserved, what’d you do to deserve it?  
What made your saintly parents so uncaring?

So as you name your sons and daughters  
Just remember that you ought to  
Give them names that won’t make them ashamed  
I’d like to ask Preserved’s parents if they ever wished they hadn’t  
Forced their son to live with such an awful name

Preserved Fish, did you ever wish  
For a name that didn’t sound like an order of smelts?  
Oh Preserved, what’d you do to deserve it?  
Did anyone ever ask you how you felt?
