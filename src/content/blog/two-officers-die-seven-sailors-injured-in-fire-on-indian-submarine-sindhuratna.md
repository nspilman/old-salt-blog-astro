The fire broke out around 40 nautical miles off Mumbai early Wednesday morning.  The submarine was undergoing sea trials following a refit at the Mumbai dockyard from May to December last year.   The fire started in the battery compartment.  94 naval personnel were aboard the submarine. 

This is the second deadly accident on one of the Indian Navy’s Soviet Kilo Class submarines within the last few months. In August , the INS [*Sindhurakshak*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Sindhurakshak_\(S63\))  caught fire, exploded and sank while at Mumbai’s naval dockyard.  The submarine has yet to be fulled salvaged but eighteen sailors are believed to have died.
