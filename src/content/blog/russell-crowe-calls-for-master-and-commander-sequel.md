The second time I saw the film, I managed to ignore the plot and enjoy the glorious cinematography and the wonderful special effects storms and fog, not to mention the footage of the *[Rose](http://www.tallshiprose.org/)*, the replica frigate that became [HMS *Surprise*](http://www.sdmaritime.org/hms-surprise/), or the full scale model of the ship on which 90% of the footage was shot, which resulted in a [production budget of  $135 million or so.](http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/MCMDR.php)

Now, Russell Crowe, who played Captain Jack Aubrey in the movie, has launched a campaign on Twitter to promote a sequel to the movie.    And why not make a sequel?  The movie got great reviews, after all.   The problem is that the movie only [grossed about $209 million](http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/MCMDR.php), which means that after subtracting the theater owner’s cut and the cost of advertising, the movie lost money.  Not necessarily a lot of money, but it was a loser nevertheless, and the corporations who make movies these days usually do not make sequels of money losing movies.   Then again Crowe is a “star,”  so who knows?

*The Gladiator star is keen to reprise his role as Jack Aubrey in the film based on the Napoleonic Wars.*

*And he’s posted a message on Twitter.com in a bid to garner support from his fans to help resurrect the film.*

*He writes, “If you want a Master and Commander sequel I suggest you e-mail (film executive) Tom Rothman at Fox and let him know your thoughts.”*

*And Crowe’s appeal has already worked – a Fox spokesperson has revealed the company has so far been inundated with requests for the movie and admits staff are now looking into the prospect.*

For those who tweet and wish to support Crowe’s efforts, the hash code is :

@20thcenturyfox Please make a sequel to Master & Commander! (via @cinemablend & @russellcrowe) #holdfast
