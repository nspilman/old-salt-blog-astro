![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/underwatervolcano01.jpg)Last month we posted about [Kick’em Jenny](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/09/kick-em-jenny-rocking-out-underwater/), an active underwater volcano off Grenada in the Caribbean, which was last active in 2001. Now the eruption of an active underwater volcano off [El Hierro Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Hierro), in the Canary Islands off the northwest coast of Africa, has caused Spanish officials to shut the port of La Restinga. Ships have been ordered away from waters around La Restinga and aircraft have been banned from flying over the island’s southern tip. The 600 residents of the port were evacuated Tuesday. The water temperature around the up-welling associated with the eruption has risen sharply and there have been reports of pyroclasts, airborne volcanic fragments, erupting from the area.
