[Reuters also reports that Peter Berdowski,](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/03/15/uk-italy-shipwreck-salvage-idUKBRE82E0BN20120315) CEO of the Dutch dredging and maritime services company, Boskalis, says that the cost of refloating the *Costa Concordia* intact from the ledge where the ship is now perched off the island of Giglio, will cost “far beyond 100 million” Euros.  The ship was delivered in 2006 at a cost of [€](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro "Euro")450 million.  Boskalis is one of [six companies bidding](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/6-bids-launched-for-salvage-operation-to-remove-costa-cruise-ship-from-tuscan-coast/2012/03/09/gIQAgBqb1R_story.html) on the salvage of the sunken cruise ship.  Thanks to Phil Leon for contributing to this post.
