![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/01/kodiak.jpg)In two separate incidents, [US Coast Guard Air Station Kodiac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_Guard_Air_Station_Kodiak) crews rescued eleven fisherman from two boats on Wednesday. The 58-foot fishing vessel *Kimberly* ran aground on Portage Bay southwest of Kodiak on the Alaska Peninsula Tuesday night around 8 p.m. but severe weather prevented the Coast Guard from rescuing the four fishermen.  As the crews returned Wednesday morning to the *Kimberly,* they received a Mayday call from the 68-foot fishing vessel *Heritage* which was sinking south of Kodiak Island.  
  
Five of the *Heritage*‘s crew were rescued from their liferaft by the tug *Tuxendi*. Two other crew members who were in the water, were hoisted aboard the US Coast Guard Jayhawk helicopter and transported to Kodiak in good condition. The crew aboard the tug were carried to Lazy Bay on the south end of Kodiak Island and dropped off.

The four-person crew of the Kimberly had walked to shore at low tide. A helicopter hoisted them onboard about 10:30 a.m. with the help of a rescue swimmer. All 11 people rescued Wednesday were wearing survival suits and reported to be in good medical condition.
