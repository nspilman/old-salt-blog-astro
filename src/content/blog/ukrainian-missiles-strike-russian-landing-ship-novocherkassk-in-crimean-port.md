![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Russlandingship.jpg)Today, the Ukrainian Air Force said that it had destroyed the [*Novocherkassk*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_landing_ship_Novocherkassk), a large landing ship, in the Crimean port of Feodosia overnight. Russia’s Defense Ministry told the Tass state news agency that the ship had been damaged in an attack using “aircraft-guided missiles,” but did not say whether the vessel had been permanently disabled.

Unverified videos posted to social media reportedly show very large explosions seen at the Feodosia port after the attack. According to Ukraine’s Air Force, the vessel suffered secondary explosions and will be difficult to repair.

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67821515) reports that one person was killed in the attack, according to the Russian-installed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov. Several others were reportedly hurt. Six buildings were damaged and a small number of people had to be taken to temporary accommodation centers, Mr. Aksyonov added.

In a statement by Ukraine’s Air Force, they said that they believed the ship was used to transport Iranian-made attack unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Andrii Klymenko, the head of the Black Sea Institute of Strategic Studies analyzed the video of the attack and told The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/26/world/europe/ukraine-crimea-russia-warship-novocherkassk.html): “Judging by the video of the explosion, which was very powerful, it was carrying explosives: either shells or missiles or, as some people say, drones”. An unverified photograph claimed to be of the ship by Ukrainian military bloggers, taken in the daytime the next day shows extensive debris of the ship above water.

Russian officials confirmed the attack, and stated that one person was killed and two injured by a fire in the city started by the attack while describing the ship as ‘damaged’. Russian officials also claimed that two Ukrainian Su-24s were shot down by anti-aircraft fire during the attack, which Ukraine denied.

Ukrainian President Zelensky said in a statement about the attack: “I am grateful to our Air Force for the spectacular replenishment of the Russian Black Sea submarine fleet with another vessel. There will be no peaceful place for the occupiers in Ukraine.”
