The *Mars* was believed to be one of the largest ships of her day.  When the ship sank she carried a fortune in silver coins, as well as 800 to 900 sailors, all of which ended at the bottom.  The wreck of the Mars has long been sought after. There is a legend that a specter rose from the inferno when Mars sank, to guard the ship against ever being discovered.  After 450 years, perhaps the legendary specter has retired. At least one silver coin has been recovered. Also numerous bones have been found at the wreck site from the ill-fated sailors and soldiers who went down with the ship.  There is video of the shipwreck after the page break.
