Following the example of [Greta Thunberg](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/08/greta-thunberg-sails-into-new-york-harbor/), who traveled to a UN climate conference by sail in August, 36 young climate change activists set sail from Amsterdam on October 2, bound for COP25 – the United Nations Climate Conference.  Rather than boarding airplanes, the group chose to charter the [*Regina Maris*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/?imo=7025126), a 101 ft (31m) LOA, 1970 built steel Dutch topsail schooner for the 5,000 nautical mile trip. 

[Classic Sailor](https://classicsailor.com/2019/10/36-activists-sailing-to-chile-climate-conference/?fbclid=IwAR3qb8Ydjccvj7ptCSJkNBJySg7ipS-qB7VkInfazpG0c29iXukslV7JZYI) reports that *the activists, from all across Europe, are hoping to use the seven-week voyage to brainstorm ideas for greener transport which they then intend to present to world governments meeting in Santiago from 2 – 13 December. But they will also be helping the six permanent crew to sail Regina Maris. Living in four-person cabins they plan to eat vegan meals. The voyage has scheduled stops at Casablanca, Tenerife, Cape Verde, and Recife to pick up fresh fruit and vegetables and get ashore for a few hours. When they arrive in Rio they will take a bus across the South American continent to Chile – a distance of some 3,000 kilometers.*

*Jeppe Bijker, one of four Dutch initiators of the Sail to the COP project, told reporters he did not expect people to give up flying altogether. “But we do ask that they think about why they are flying. You should ask yourself do you really need to go? Maybe it’s a business flight … and there could be an e-conference instead. And do you need to take so many short-haul trips?”*

*They are also asking governments to raise a fair tax on aviation and on fuel especially, and to promote more sustainable ways of travel: on trains, buses, and boats.*

*After the conference in Chile some of the group plan to stay in the Americas and sail home with Regina Maris next year. Others are booking passages home on cargo ships – seen as a much more sustainable way to travel if you can’t sail.*
