![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/roboat.jpg)Autonomous barges may soon be carrying cargo and passengers on Amsterdam’s 100 km of canals. Referred to as [roboats](http://www.globalconstructionreview.com/news/fleets-autonomous-boats-be-put-work-amsterdams-can/) (as in robot boats, not rowboats) they can also be linked together to create bridges and performance stages and platforms. The roboats are a pilot project led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS).

In addition to carrying cargo and being linked up as temporary structures, researchers also see the potential for monitoring water quality and cleaning up floating garbage. Arjan van Timmeren, AMS Institute’s scientific director, told the [Global Construction Review:](http://www.globalconstructionreview.com/news/fleets-autonomous-boats-be-put-work-amsterdams-can/) “We could, for instance, do further research on underwater robots that can detect diseases or use Roboats to rid the canals of floating waste and find a more efficient way to handle the 12,000 bicycles that end up in the city’s canals each year.”

The project which has $25 million in funding is expected to last five years.
