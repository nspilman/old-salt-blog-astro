The whaleship [*Charles W. Morgan*](http://www.mysticseaport.org/visit/explore/morgan/) left the dock at Mystic, CT for the first time since her arrival in 1941.  On Saturday, she was towed down the Mystic River into Long Island Sound and up the Thames River to City Pier in New London, where she will load ballast. Over an 80-year whaling career, the Morgan embarked on 37 voyages between 1841 and 1921, most lasting three years or more.  Over the last six years, the ship was undergone a $12 million restoration and will soon depart on her 38th voyage to historic ports of New England this summer.  The *Morgan* will be open to the public at the New London City Pier from May 24-25, 31, and June 1.

The *Charles W. Morgan*, launched in 1841, is the last of an American whaling fleet that numbered more than 2,700 vessels. The *Morgan* is now America’s oldest commercial ship still afloat and the last of her kind. Thanks to Irwin Bryan for contributing to this post.
