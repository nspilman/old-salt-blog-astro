Ocean Renewable Power Company (ORPC) Tidal Turbine

Our [recent posts](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/08/most-powerful-tidal-turbine-goes-on-line-off-scotland/) about tidal turbines to create clean energy have raised interesting comments and questions about the impact of the underwater turbines on fish and mammals. Will seals, seabirds, and fish be sliced and diced by underwater turbines? Will the sounds of underwater generators disrupt the marine habitat? Are these new technologies doing more harm than good?

While there is always more research to be done, all indications are that the tidal turbines, in their various forms, are not harming sealife. Indeed, in one case, the turbine installation may have created a marine sanctuary of sorts, promoting marine life.

One group monitoring the impact of marine renewable energy (MRE) on sealife is [Tethys](https://tethys.pnnl.gov/about-tethys). Tethys, named after the Greek titaness of the sea, was developed in 2009 by the [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/) (PNNL) to support the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/) (DOE) [Wind Energy Technologies Office](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/wind-energy-technologies-office) and [Water Power Technologies Office](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/water-power-technologies-office).

From their [website](https://tethys.pnnl.gov/about-tethys): In order to address the growing global demand for energy, industry is looking to extract energy from renewable sources such as wind, waves, and tides. Yet potential environmental effects must be evaluated and measured to ensure that animals, habitats, and ecosystem functions are not adversely affected, nor that existing ocean and land uses be displaced. The goal of Tethys is to progress industry in an environmentally-responsible manner.

So what has Tethys concluded? Are fish being struck by underwater turbines? Apparently not.

From [Are fish in danger? A review of environmental effects of marine renewable energy on fishes](https://tethys.pnnl.gov/publications/are-fish-danger-review-environmental-effects-marine-renewable-energy-fishes): *Field- and laboratory-based studies that have examined fish presence, avoidance, and evasion around MRE devices suggest that collisions are rare.*

And what about noise and magnetic fields from power cables?  *Studies exposing fish to turbine-generated noise and electromagnetic fields demonstrate little effect on fish behavior; in fact, MRE device noise falls below reported hearing thresholds.*

Are seals threatened by underwater turbines? Apparently, seals are smart enough to avoid the turbines. From [Quantifying the effects of tidal turbine array operations on the distribution of marine mammals: Implications for collision risk:](https://tethys.pnnl.gov/publications/quantifying-effects-tidal-turbine-array-operations-distribution-marine-mammals) *Seals showed overt avoidance responses during turbine operations, with a significant decrease in predicted abundance (95% CIs: −11%, −49%) within ∼2 km of the array.*

Overall researchers have found that compared to other coastal energy projects, such as offshore oil drilling, the [threat of most planned wave and tidal energy setups is quite low](https://www.hakaimagazine.com/news/measuring-the-risks-of-tidal-power/).
