Abby Sunderland

The story is still developing, but there are serious concerns for the 16 year old solo sailor.

[Abby Sunderland Feared Lost at Sea](http://abcnews.go.com/2020/abby-sunderland-possibly-lost-sea/story?id=10877108)

*Abby Sunderland, 16, who is attempting to become the youngest sailor ever to circumnavigate the globe, was feared lost at sea today after her crew lost contact with her boat.*  
  
*Jeff Casher, an engineer on Sunderland’s support team, said two emergency beacons on her boat are now signaling she is in trouble.  Abby’s mother, MaryAnne Sunderland, told ABC News that Abby manually activated two beacons around 6 a.m. Pacific Time Thursday.  A beacon designed to automatically go off when it contacts water had not been activated, she said.*

*Abby was in 20-25 foot waves at the time of last contact, with 35-knot winds, said MaryAnne Sunderland, who is due to give birth at the end of the month. She was shaken but focused on trying to get a rescue effort together.*

*The closest land to Abby’s boat was Reunion Island, which is east of Madagascar.  The nearest ship was 400 miles away. Rescuers were trying to contact the ship.*
