![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/nora1.jpg)Steve Shapiro’s frequently rescued sailboat *Nora*, has been sold. In January, [we posted about a pair of American sailors who had been rescued nine times](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/01/us-sailors-rescued-nine-times-in-seven-days-disaster-waiting-to-happen/) in sailing from Norwalk to Cornwell in the UK on a 40′ gaff rigged sloop named *Nora*.  The two sailors, Bob Weise and Steve Shapiro, both 71, had been attempting to sail across the Atlantic from Norway to Maine but had suffered a variety of breakdowns and groundings which resulted in calling for help from rescue teams from Norway, Scotland, Ireland and the UK.

Veteran yachtsman, Sir Robin Knox-Johnston was one of the many who criticized the two sailors. In January, Sir Robin said, “*This is no longer a joke. It costs between £6,000 and £8,000 every time a lifeboat is launched. These guys are costing the RNLI a fortune. They need to frankly pack it in or, I hate to say it, get the hell out of our waters.”*

The [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-36057877) is reporting that Dartmouth-based yacht brokers, Wooden Ships, confirmed it had sold the Nora which was moored at Hayle harbour about two weeks ago.

Mr. Shapiro says that he has now purchased a 40′ yacht in Maine and plans to sail the east coast of the US with friends.
