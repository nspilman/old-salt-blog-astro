![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/contopsails2.jpg)The [USS *Constitution*](https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/) left its berth in the [Charleston Navy Yard](https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/cny.htm) last Friday for a short cruise in Boston Harbor. [CBS Boston](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2021/10/22/uss-constitution-navy-sailors-21-gun-salute-boston-harbor/) reports that the ship fired a 21-gun salute while carrying 120 newly-trained Navy sailors. The sailors were recently selected to advance to the rank of chief petty officer.

As part of the Navy’s Heritage Week Training, the sailors lived aboard the ship, which is the world’s oldest commissioned warship afloat.

During the short cruise, the crew set the ship’s three topsails, the first time they have been set since 2012.

[USS *Constitution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution), also known as Old Ironsides, is a wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy. She is the world’s oldest ship of any type still afloat. She was launched in 1797, one of six original frigates authorized for construction by the Naval Act of 1794 and the third constructed.
