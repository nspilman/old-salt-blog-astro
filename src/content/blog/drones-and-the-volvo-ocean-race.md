![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/04/dfdroneshot.jpg)Yesterday, we posted about the upcoming [Golden Globe 2018 Race](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/04/return-of-the-golden-globe-race-a-retro-race-around-the-world/) in which traditional sailboats will race around the globe using only the technology available in the original race in 1968. The idea has a certain appeal but also definite limitations. There is something to be said for technology that lets arm-chair sailors catch a glimpse of the power and majesty of racing yachts screaming along in mid-ocean.

One of the most thrilling technologies, at least to my eyes, are the myriad of video feeds being recorded on the boats competing in the Velux and Volvo round the world races, among others. And of the range of cameras, some of the most exciting footage has come from drones launched and controlled from the decks of the racers. 

What makes drones so amazing is that they are the first and really only means to see these racing yachts under sail in the open ocean, beyond the range of helicopters. Onboard reporter Sam Greenfield was the first to attempt to get drone footage while under sail in the previous Volvo Ocean Race. His footage was so good that now every boat in the current race has a drone aboard. The [DJI Phantom appears to be the drone of choice.](https://www.dji.com/products/phantom?site=brandsite&from=nav)

Below is an interview with Sam Greenfield from 2105 about how he started flying a drone from a Volvo racer and also drone footage from Team Brunel boat in this year’s race.
