The [Seaport Museum of New York](http://www.seany.org/), better known as the South Street Seaport Museum, will be taken over by the [Museum of the City of New York](http://www.mcny.org/) with starting funds of $2 million in the form of a grant from the [Lower Manhattan Development Corporation](http://www.renewnyc.com/).   The [Seaport Museum has been effectively shut down since last February](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/15/new-yorks-seaport-museum-struggles-to-stay-afloat/) due to a major shortfall of funds.
