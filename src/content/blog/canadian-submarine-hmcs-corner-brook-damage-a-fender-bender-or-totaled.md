HMCS Corner Brook

Canadian Submarine *[HMCS Corner Brook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMCS_Corner_Brook_\(SSK_878\))* ran aground during manoeuvres off Vancouver Island in June 2011.  Two sailors were slightly injured.  The Canadian navy never described the extent of the damage or released a photograph of the damage to the sub.  The sub has now just been drydocked for repairs.  [Canadian Senator Colin Kenny](http://colinkenny.ca/en/), the former head of the Senate defence committee, commented that  “*I was gobsmacked. I had no idea that this level of damage had occurred,*” describing the damage to the sub as “*horrific*.”  
  
[Rear-Admiral Mark Norman](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mark-norman/41/397/5b4), deputy commander of the Royal Canadian Navy, said that the damage is not as bad as it looks.  “*When you’re looking at your damaged car in the intersection, and you can drive it home, you don’t really know how badly damaged it is,*” Norman said. “*It is similar to a fender bender, yes. It just happens to be a very expensive piece of equipment.”* 

*[CBC News](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2012/02/13/ns-hmcs-corner-brook-damage.html)* quotes unnamed sources “*familiar with the submarine*” who suggest that the pressure hull has been damaged and is beyond repair, while Canadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay is [quoted as saying](http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120214/submarine-crash-sonar-damaged-120214/),  “*I am able to confirm it is in fact the HMCS Corner Brook, the picture does represent the damage to what is known as the fibreglass sonar dome, which covers the sonar array of equipment aboard the HMCS Corner Brook. Now, it has not affected the external hub or the pressure hull if you will, of the submarine itself, and so the watertight integrity of the submarine remains intact*.”

Is the damage “a fender bender,” or is the submarine “totalled?”  Only time will tell.

The Canadian submarine fleet has had a rough time in recent years. Canada purchased four used [British Victoria class subs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upholder/Victoria_class_submarine) more than a decade ago and so far, has spent an estimated $3 billion on the fleet. Currently, none of the four subs is in service.

Ron Devion writing for the *[Times Colonist](http://www.timescolonist.com/Submarines/6161859/story.html)* notes:

*Enough embarrassment already. It is well past time for the navy brain-trust to accept the fact the Brits conned Canada into purchasing four submarines well past their “best-before” date. Since 1998, our jinxed fleet has spent more time on land than in water.*
