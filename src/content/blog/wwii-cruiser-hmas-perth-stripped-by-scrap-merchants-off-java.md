Recently there has been disturbing news that the wreck of [HMAS *Perth*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Perth_\(D29\)) is being stripped by scrap merchants in the sea off Java. In February 1942, the Leander class cruiser HMAS *Perth* was sunk by Japanese torpedoes in the Battle of the Sunda Strait. Of the 681 sailors aboard, 353 died. Of the 328 survivors, all but four became prisoners of war, of which only 218 lived to return home to Australia after the war.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing the news along.
