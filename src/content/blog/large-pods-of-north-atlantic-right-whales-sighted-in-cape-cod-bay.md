![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rightwhales-capecod.jpg)[WWLP-22News](https://www.wwlp.com/news/massachusetts/clusters-of-right-whales-in-cape-cod-bay-area/?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_medium=referral&fbclid=IwAR2n5Ey94xkSDkvX4H6vUd63IBisSr0_Ue-86JxiyJJlAVQlVB8GHTr_jXA) reports that at least 160 [North Atlantic right whales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_right_whale) were spotted in Cape Cod Bay and along South Shore at the end of last week. Given that the highly endangered species are estimated to number fewer than 400 animals, the right whale sightings in the area are extremely impressive. 

The [Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries](https://www.facebook.com/MAMarineFisheries/?__cft__[0]=AZUr7zA2EfrRjPl1n8t0Yyzuij9lCNiB5LlSVJb_zVgmNofU0cpLpphxlQqSwt1FBOvDzKO9FsO3FIHoUlz6mpyDzW1M51c-GENfXgzIkjQg7v_phfM2oQC21pP3eKsvPFTub9sAyzuvd-61L5D-s2jg&__tn__=-UC%2CP-R) has extended the small vessel speed restriction in Cape Cod Bay through May 15, 2021. Small vessels (less than 65’) are required to travel at speeds no greater than 10 knots in this area. Right whales are highly susceptible to injury and death due to vessel collision. A complementary federal speed restriction in the area applies to vessels 65’ and greater until May 15.

The [Division of Fisheries](https://www.facebook.com/MAMarineFisheries/posts/2681498548806864) also noted that during aerial surveillance on April 27 and 28, the Center for Coastal Studies documented at least 160 right whales (~40% of the known population) in Cape Cod Bay and along the South Shore, all of which were skim feeding at the surface or just below the surface. This intense feeding behavior makes them somewhat oblivious to their surroundings, often difficult to see, and highly susceptible to vessel collision. Ten right whale mother/calf pairs have also been documented in the area. All mariners are advised to follow the speed limit and use extreme caution when transiting the area. Additionally, it is unlawful, under state and federal law, to approach a right whale within 500 yards.
