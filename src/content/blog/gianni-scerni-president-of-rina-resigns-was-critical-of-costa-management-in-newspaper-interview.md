![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rinapres.jpg)Shortly after [Costa Crociere](http://www.costacruise.com/) chairman and CEO Pier Luigi Foschi blamed the grounding of the *Costa Concordia* on an ”*inexplicable*” error by the captain, Gianni Scerni, the president of [RINA](http://www.rina.org/en/index.aspx), sat down for an interview with the Italian newspaper [Il Secolo XIX](http://www.ilsecoloxix.it/).  [RINA, Registro Italiano Navale](http://www.costacruise.com/), is the Italian classification society that issued the certificate of seaworthiness and the [Safety Management System](http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/ismcode1993.html) (SMS) certification for the *Costa Concordia.*  The resulting article, titled *[Ma l’armatore non poteva non sapere](http://www.ilsecoloxix.it/p/italia/2012/01/17/APuMqfhB-scerni_poteva_armatore.shtml)* (*But the owner could not find out*) is critical of Costa management and questions the claim that Costa was unaware of the practice of its ships presenting a “salute” or “bow” in the form of a close passage by island of Giglio.   Within hours of its publication, Gianni Scerni announced his resignation as the president of [RINA](http://www.rina.org/en/index.aspx).   He disputed the accuracy of some of the comments in the interview but decided to resign from RINA nevertheless.
