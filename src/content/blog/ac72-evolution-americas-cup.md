![ac72](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/10/ac72.jpg)For anyone in the New York Area I will be speaking at the New York Shiplore and Model-makers Club on Tuesday night at 7:30 PM on the “AC72 and the Evolution of the [America’s Cup](http://www.americascup.com/en/).” The [AC72 catamarans](http://www.americascup.com/ac72) which raced in the recent competition have been described as more flying machines than sailboats.  I will be examining how we got from the schooner yacht *America* of 1851 to the screaming AC72s of today, looking at the teams, the scandals, the upsets, and the technology that made this last America’s Cup so riveting.  It should be a fun evening.  If you are nearby on Tuesday, be sure to stop by  79 Walker Street, 5th floor — at 7:30 pm.
