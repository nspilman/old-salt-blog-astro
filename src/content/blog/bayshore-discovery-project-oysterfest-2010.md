[Bayshore Discovery Project](http://www.ajmeerwald.org/), the good folks who keep the historic schooner *[A.J. Meerwald](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Meerwald)* sailing, are having their yearly Oyster Fest! this Friday, November 12th  at the Centerton Country Club in Pittsgrove, NJ.  Today, Monday November 8th, is the last day to reserve tickets.

From their press release:  
We hope you’ll take this last opportunity to reserve your tickets for OysterFest 2010.  We know that funds are tight for everyone this year –  that’s why we need your participation more than ever. OysterFest is our biggest, most important fund-raiser of the year. A good turnout will help to ensure that we can continue to offer award winning, often life-changing, education programs aboard the historic 1928 oyster schooner *A.J. MEERWALD* – connecting students and families to their history, culture and environment.  Funds raised also support scholarships to help low income students and underserved school systems participate in these programs. All that good stuff and its a really fun night to boot!

OysterFest will be held in the Grand Ballroom at the Centerton Country Club in Pittsgrove on Friday Nov. 12th. A sumptuous land and sea buffet will include delicious appetizers, spectacular oyster and seafood entrees, carving stations and plenty of other landlubber fare, and awesome desserts.

The evening begins at 6:00 p.m. with cocktails, hors d’oeuvres, and music by members of the Good Tymes Band. Dinner starts at 7:15 p.m., with dancing to Good Tymes to follow. A cash bar will be open throughout the evening.

OysterFest’s extraordinary silent auction will feature the work of some of South Jersey’s best-known artists and craftspeople. Art lovers will be able to bid on works by ‘Bay Gals’ Joan Getsinger, Liz Sherman, Maxine Lewis and Dorothy Connor; plus Pat Witt; Stan Sperlak; Glenn Rudderow; Pat Moore; Peg Dittmar; Verna McClain; Maryann Cannon; Alan Carman; Jacqueline Sandro; Tricia Dufford; Laura Turpin; Michelle Post; Shirley Mazzi; Al Meale; Robert Baum; Gail South; and many more.

The auction will also include a wide variety of goods and services, plus many themed gift baskets. There will be something exciting for every age and gender, making this the perfect place to find great holiday gifts for those hard-to-shop-for people on your list!

A live auction at 8:00 p.m. will offer romantic getaways, family adventures, and exciting party packages for larger groups – perfect for reunions, clubs or corporate outings. These include a weeklong getaway at an oceanfront Downeast Maine cottage; a vacation week in the Florida Keys in a large waterfront home that sleeps 14; a lakeside boating party (boats and lessons included) for up to 25 people at Lake Audrey; a Jersey Shore getaway weekend with entertainment and accommodations; and a private charter sail for up to 45 people on the schooner A.J. MEERWALD.

Special thanks go to OysterFest co-host Soroptomist International of Cumberland County Inc.; to event sponsor Century Savings Bank; and to the many other sponsors, donors, volunteers and friends who are helping to make OysterFest 2010 possible.

Tickets are $80 per person and full tables may be reserved for groups of ten. The reservation deadline has been extended through November 8th.
