[USS *Ling*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Ling) is a US Navy Balao-class submarine. The sub is currently sitting in the mud in the Hackensack River at the former location of the defunct New Jersey Naval Museum in Hackensack, New Jersey. The Ling has no access from shore, has been [flooded, and vandalized](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=uss+ling). [Marine enthusiasts are interested in restoring the ship](https://www.facebook.com/groups/338689653415753/about/) but have not found answers to the logistical challenges of moving the submarine out of a silted up river and past four bridges across the Hackensack River, south of the *Ling*, that do not open or move.

Here is a video tour of the submarine posted last week.
