![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/12/cunardcaptain.jpg)Our belated congratulations to Inger Klein Olsen, who took command of Cunard Line’s *[Queen Victoria](http://www.cunard.com/Ships/Queen-Victoria/)* at the beginning of December.  She is the first woman to take command of a Cunard Line ship in the line’s 170 year history.

[History is Made As Cunard Appoints the Line’s First Female Captain](http://www.maritime-executive.com/pressrelease/cunard-appoints-first-female-captain-dec/)

*“While we are far from being the first shipping company to have a female captain, it is nonetheless noteworthy when such a long-established British institution as Cunard makes a break with its captaincy tradition,” said Peter Shanks, president of Cunard. “But as Mark Twain drily observed, ‘the folks at Cunard wouldn’t appoint Noah himself as captain until he had worked his way up through the ranks.’ Inge has certainly done that,” Shanks continued, “and we are delighted to welcome her as our first woman driver.”*  
  
*Captain Olsen’s first task at the helm of Queen Victoria was to take the ship, without passengers, to drydock in Hamburg for its planned refit. Next Wednesday, 15 December, she will be on the bridge as the ship sets sail with a full complement of guests.*

*Forty-three-year-old Captain Olsen was raised in the Faroe Islands, which accounts for her maritime abilities, and she joined Cunard in 1997 as First Officer on board Caronia. In 2001 she transferred to the Seabourn fleet, which at that time was part of Cunard. She sailed on Seabourn Sun and Seabourn Spirit before being promoted to the rank of Staff Captain on Seabourn Pride in 2003.*

*Following some years with other companies within the Carnival Corporation group, Captain Olsen returned to Cunard in August this year as Deputy Captain of Queen Victoria.*
