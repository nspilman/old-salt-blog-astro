The Azure Window collapsed in a storm on March 8, 2017. Before and after.

The Azure Window is no more. The iconic limestone arch on the island of Gozo in Malta was destroyed in a winter storm on March 8th. The 92′ high arch, a product of the erosion and collapse of two sea caves, finally succumb to erosion and entirely collapsed into the sea. The arch had been growing progressively wider over the last thirty years as portions of the top slab and pillar of the arch fell away. In 2014, after rocks falls in 2012 and 2013, it was made illegal to walk on the arch. 

The Azure Window was a major Maltese tourist attraction served as the backdrop for numerous movies and television programs, including Game of Thrones, Clash of the Titans, The Count of Monte Cristo and the Odyssey.

The video below includes photos of the Azure Window from 1880 to the present.
