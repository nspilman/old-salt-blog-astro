Yantian Express, ex Shanghai Express

On Thursday, a fire broke out in one cargo container on the *[Yantian Express](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:133723/mmsi:211367460/imo:9229831/vessel:YANTIAN_EXPRESS)*, a 7,510 TEU container ship, about 1,500 kilometers southeast of Halifax. The fire spread to adjacent containers. The firefighting tug, *Smit Nicobar*, arrived Friday evening but weather conditions limited what the tug’s crew could do to fight the fire. 

*Yantian Express* has a complement of 8 officers and 15 seafarers. On Saturday, 11 of the crew moved aboard the *Smit Nicobar*. The remaining personnel are expected to shift aboard the tug on Sunday. With improved weather conditions, the tug is continuing to fight the container fire aboard the ship.

A second tug, the Maersk Mobiliser, is expected to arrive on Sunday evening to tow the burning ship to Halifax.

[*Yantian Express*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yantian_Express) is a [Hapag-Lloyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapag-Lloyd) Hamburg Express class container ship, delivered in 2002. She was constructed by Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan, South Korea and measures 320 by 43 m (1,050 by 141 ft). The ship departed Colombo, Sri Lanka, and was bound to Halifax via the Suez Canal.
