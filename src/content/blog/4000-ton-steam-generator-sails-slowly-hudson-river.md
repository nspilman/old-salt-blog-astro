![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/08/steam-generator.jpg)Rivers have always made the best highways. On Monday, a massive [heat-recovery steam generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_recovery_steam_generator) left the Port of Coeymans, near Albany, on the Hudson River, on a barge bound for a new power plant under construction in Sewaren, NJ. The generator weighs in at an impressive 4,000 short tons, is 130 feet tall and costs $195 million. 

The generator was welded to the deck of a 400′ long deck barge with a 100′ beam and was taken under tow down the Hudson River.  Once in New York harbor, the barge was towed up the Arthur Kill to Sewaren.  The pace of the voyage was determined by the currents and several bridges, including the Mid-Hudson Bridge and the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge, which the generator could only pass under at low water.  

The heat-recovery steam generator is a major component of a $600 million plant expected to open next year off Cliff Road in the Sewaren section of Woodbridge. As reported by [NJ.com](http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2017/08/195m_steam_generator_headed_down_hudson_to_nj.html):  Sewaren 7 will replace PSEG Power’s existing Sewaren Generating Station, replacing Units 1, 2, 3 and 4, which will be retired after nearly 70 years. It was badly damaged during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.  The new plant will be a dual-fuel, 540-megawatt plant that will run primarily on natural gas but can also run on ultra low-sulfur distillate fuel oil as a backup fuel, according to information provided by the utility.
