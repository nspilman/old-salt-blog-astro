Here is a fascinating short video of British riveted steel shipbuilding in the 1940s. The shipyard in the film is the [Burntisland Shipbuilding Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burntisland_Shipbuilding_Company#:~:text=The%20Burntisland%20Shipbuilding%20Company%20was,as%20part%20of%20British%20Shipbuilders.) in Fife. The ship being built is thought to be either the [MV *Dalhousie*](https://wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?137037) or the [SS *Ger-y-Bryn*](https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?15390). Both ships were sunk by German vessels by April 1943. Thanks to W. H. Bunting for pointing out the video.
