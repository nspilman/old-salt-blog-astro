According to the folks at the [National Aquarium](http://nationalaquarium.wordpress.com/), today is the tenth annual celebration of [World Octopus Day](http://nationalaquarium.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/happy-world-octopus-day/).  Strange that I didn’t have it marked on my calendar.  In honor of this auspicious eight-legged holiday we are reposting a a rather amazing video from from a website called “[everybody loves cephalopods](http://boingboing.net/2011/01/27/octo.html).”  (I know that I do, usually lightly fried.)  I have to admit that after watching this excerpt from a 30 minute presentation by [Maggie Koerth-Baker](http://boingboing.net/author/maggie_koerth_baker) that I am indeed fascinated by octopus brains.  Definitely worth a look.
