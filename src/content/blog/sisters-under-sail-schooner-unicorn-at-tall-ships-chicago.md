Earlier this week we posted about [Tall Ships Chicago 2010](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/23/tall-ships-chicago-2010/).   Among the roughly 20 tall ships participating is the 118-foot topsail schooner *[Unicorn](http://www.tallshipunicorn.com/index.html)* whose crew includes six Chicago-area girls from the “[Sisters Under Sail](http://www.sistersundersail.org/)” program.

[“Adventure of a Lifetime” is About More Than Sails, Knots](http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local-beat/tall-ships-sisters-under-sail-101440769.html)  
  
*The ship’s owner had four girls of her own that she raised on the boat and realized how giving other girls an opportunity to sail on their own was a way to teach life lessons.*

*“We saw our own daughters growing up aboard ships crewing in their summer months, and when they were ready to go off to college I saw that they were armed with so much more confidence than I ever had when I was their age, and we knew we had something really special that we could offer just for girls,” said Dawn Santamaria.*

*Roughly 400 girls have gone through the program, taking away more than just a knowledge of knots and sails.*
