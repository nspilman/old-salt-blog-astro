![brendan_orig](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/03/brendan_orig.jpg)On this St. Patrick’s Day, it seems worthwhile to recall the story of another Irish saint, [Brendan the Navigator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan), who is said to have sailed off on a seven year voyage across the Atlantic, from Ireland to the “Isle of the Blessed” and back.  The tale is recorded in the Latin text, “*[Navigatio sancti Brendani abbatis](http://www.amazon.com/Navigatio-Sancti-Brendani-Abbatis-Selmer/dp/1851820477)“,  “The Voyage of Saint Brendan, the Abbot.”*  The text is thought to date to AD 800 and to describe events of AD 512–530.

According to the legend, Brendan set sail in a [currach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currach), a boat made of animal skins stretched over a wooden frame, with a crew of around 18.  On the voyage, Brendan is said to have seen towering crystal pillars afloat on the sea, a huge sea monster, an island with giant sheep and a land where giants hurled fireballs reeking of sulfur at their boat. They finally arrived at the “Promised Land of the Saints” where they stayed for 40 days and then sailed for home.

For centuries the story was taken at more or less face value and many looked for the “Promised Land of the Saints,” which became to be known as “Brendan’s Island.” When no such island was found, some speculated that the Brendan could have sailed to North America, to the land that the Vikings would later call Vinland.

Could a sixth century group of Irish monks have sailed across the Atlantic in a leather-skinned boat. Most scholars dismissed the suggested out of hand.  Nevertheless, [Scandinavian sagas suggest that the Irish had already visited](http://www.history.com/news/did-an-irish-monk-discover-america) North America by the time the Vikings landed there around 1000 A.D. The Vikings referred to the lands south of their settlement in Vinland as “Irland it Mikla,” or “Greater Ireland.”

[Tim Severin, a British explorer, historian and writer,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Severin#The_Brendan_Voyage_.281976.E2.80.931977.29) thought that it might be possible for Brendan to have made such a voyage. He built a currach using traditional methods and between 1976 and 1977 sailed it 4,500 miles from Ireland to Peckford Island, Newfoundland, stopping at the Hebrides and Iceland along the way. Severin’s expedition may not have proven that Brendan crossed the Atlantic in a currach, but did demonstrate that such a voyage was possible.
