I suppose if you plan on smuggling a painting by Picasso worth close to $29 million, using a superyacht might be a stylish choice. For Spanish billionaire Jaime Botin, however, it didn’t work out too well. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2020/01/17/spanish-billionaire-sentenced-for-smuggling-with-his-superyacht/#448620c1eea8) reports:

Despite a 2015 high court ruling that [*Head of a Young Woman*](https://www.artforum.com/news/collector-gets-18-months-in-prison-58m-fine-for-smuggling-picasso-painting-from-spain-81923) was a “national treasure” and could not be removed from the country, Botin kept the painting on-board [*Adix*](http://classicyachtinfo.com/yachts/adix/), his 213-foot sailing yacht, as he sailed from Spain to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica. Botin then hired a private jet to take the painting from Corsica to Switzerland where he had intended to sell it.

However, Spanish authorities were tipped off and raided in the superyacht while it was anchored off the Corsican town of Calvi. *Head of a Young Woman* was seized and transferred to the Reina Sofia museum in Madrid, where it remains.

For the attempted smuggling Botin was sentenced to eighteen months in prison and fined $58 million.
