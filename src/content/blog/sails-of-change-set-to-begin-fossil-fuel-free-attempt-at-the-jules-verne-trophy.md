![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sails-of-change.jpg)The maxi-trimaran *Sails of Change* (ex-[*Spindrift 2*](https://spindrift-racing.com/maxi-spindrift-2/)) and its crew of 11, led by [Dona Bertarelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dona_Bertarelli) and [Yann Guichard](https://www.tropheejulesverne.org/en/skipper/yann-guichard/), are awaiting a favorable weather window to set off from La Trinité-sur-Mer, in southwest Brittany, on their latest attempt to claim the [Jules Verne Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_Trophy). To win the trophy they will have to beat the around the world record of 40d 23h 30′ 30″ set by Francis Joyon and his crew in 2017.

In addition to trying to set a new record, the team will be attempting to sail around the globe without an auxiliary engine or the use of fossil fuel.

“[We’re going to take on an additional challenge](https://www.sail-world.com/news/242863/Sails-of-Change-to-set-sail-on-Jules-Verne-Trophy), since we’ll be attempting to break the round the world record without using any energy produced using fossil fuels. Our main sources of energy will come from the sun and wind, as well as an on-board bike-powered generator. We are keen to show it’s possible,” explains skipper Yann Guichard.

This will be Guichard’s fourth attempt at the trophy. He will be sailing with a highly experienced crew, [five of whom have already circumnavigated the globe.](https://www.barchemagazine.com/en/sails-of-change-ready-to-challenge-for-the-jules-verne-trophy/) Two of them, Thierry Chabagny and Xavier Revil, won the Trophée Jules Verne in 2012, while Dona Bertarelli has held the women’s round-the-world speed title since 2016. In all, nine of the eleven sailors have previously been involved in an attempt to win the Jules Verne Trophy. Only Julien Villion and Yann Jauvin will be making their Trophy debuts in this legendary international offshore record event.
