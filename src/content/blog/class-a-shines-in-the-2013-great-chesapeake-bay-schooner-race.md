![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/10/woodwind.jpg)Congratulations to all the racers in this year’s [Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race](http://www.schoonerrace.org/).  In last year’s *race,  [Woodwind](http://www.schoonerwoodwind.com/), [Heron](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Schooner-Heron-Charters/203632606316106)* and *Prom Queen*, the top three Class A schooners (from 40′ to less than 50′) all beat the elapsed and corrected time of the Class AA schooners (50′ and above.)  This year’s race saw the top two Class A schooners, [*America 2.0*](http://www.sail-nyc.com/schooner-america-2.0-sails) and last years first place winner, *Woodwind*, beat the Class AA schooners on both elapsed and corrected time.  *Prom Queen*, finishing third in Class A, beat the Class AA schooners on corrected time.  The top three Class AA schooners this year were *[Pride of Baltimore I](http://www.pride2.org/)I,* [*Virginia*](http://www.schoonervirginia.org/) and *[Lady Maryland](https://livingclassrooms.org/lady_maryland_facts.php).*

Overall, the race was a faster race than last year’s. *Pride of Baltimore II* sailed the 127 NM race in 18 hours and and 29  minutes, or 7 hours and 39 minutes faster than last year. The real stand-out of the 2013 race was *America 2.0* which completed the race in 16 hours and 27 minutes, beating *Woodwind*, the next fastest boat by an hour and 41 minutes.  *America 2.0* is a schooner inspired by the yacht *America.*  Unlike her namesake, however, *America 2.0* has carbon fiber masts, a fin keel and a spade rudder.

Also congratulations to schooner *[Sultana](http://www.sultanaprojects.org/)* on winning the Rebel Educational Trophy this year! The Rebel Educational Trophy balances the triad of the Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race: a valiant race down the length of the Chesapeake Bay; historical preservation of the schooner fleet; & an education program focused on the heritage, ecology & natural resources of the Chesapeake Bay.
