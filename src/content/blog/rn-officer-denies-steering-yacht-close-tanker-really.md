[Two years ago during Cowes Race Week, the skipper of a 33′ sailboat](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/08/collision-at-cowes-sailing-yacht-dismasted-after-cutting-in-front-of-tanker/) cut across the bow of the 120,000 dwt tanker, [*Hanne Knutson*](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/showallphotos.aspx?imo=9190638&photoid=445034#top_photo), traveling down channel.  It did not end well. The boat was dismasted. Fortunately, no one died, though one of the crew on the sailboat suffered a head injury in the collision.

The case is now in court where the skipper of the sailboat, a Royal Navy lieutenant, Roland Wilson, 32, of Stanley, Perthshire is charged with violating maritime regulations including failing to comply with a “moving prohibited zone” of 1,000m (0.6 miles) in front and 100m (328ft) either side of a vessel greater than 150m (492ft). The *Hanne Knutson* is 260m (853ft) long. Lt. Wilson denies all charges. Unfortunately for the lieutenant, the collision was caught on video. Take a look and see if you think that the Royal Navy officer maintained a proper distance from the ship.
