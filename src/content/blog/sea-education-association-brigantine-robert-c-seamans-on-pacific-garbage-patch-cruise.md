SSV Robert C. Seamans

The brigantine [*Robert C. Seamans*](http://www.sea.edu/ships_crew), owned and operated by [Sea Education Association](http://www.sea.edu/) (SEA) is off on a 37 day  [Plastics at SEA: North Pacific Expedition 2012](http://www.sea.edu/plastics/) into the “[Great Pacific Garbage Patch](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/10/the-eastern-pacific-garbage-patch-how-big-really/)” to examine the effects of plastic debris, including debris generated by the 2011 Japanese tsunami, in the ocean ecosystem.

“*This expedition will be one of the first to unravel the impact that plastic pollution is having on our ocean’s ecosystem. SEA has over 25 years of experience sampling marine debris and, using this knowledge, we will further investigate the health of our marine ecosystem,*” said Emelia DeForce, the expedition’s chief scientist. “*Those onboard will have a productive and eye-opening experience with long lasting effects. We will extend this experience to the public at large through our outreach program that will take place during and after the expedition, with the goal to raise awareness of the impact that this long-lived pollutant is having in our oceans*.”

*This expedition, which will follow a 2500-nautical mile cruise track extending more than 1,500 nautical miles west of San Diego, expands upon SEA’s 25-year history of measuring plastics, tar, and other marine debris in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It is funded by Sea Education Association, with funding from the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation in support of the web-based and educational outreach programs. Additional support provided by Patagonia and Elemental Herbs.*

*The SSV Robert C. Seamans is a 134-foot brigantine-rigged sailing oceanographic research vessel. The 38-person crew includes graduate students, educators, an environmental policy analyst, medical professionals, writers, a business professional, scientists, and professional mariners, most of whom are alumni of SEA’s core academic program, SEA Semester.*
