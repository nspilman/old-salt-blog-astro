The Row to Recovery team

The [Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge](http://www.taliskerwhiskyatlanticchallenge.com/), which bills itself as the “world’s toughest rowing race,” is winding down. Of the 17 boats which set out on December 4th, seven boats have crossed the finish line in Barbados, four are still rowing, and six boats have pulled out of the race.

The racers have set several new world’s records. [Andrew Brown, the only solo rower in the race](http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2106486_rower_writes_his_name_into_the_record_books), came in second overall and set a new world record for the fastest solo row across the Atlantic, completing the voyage in 40 days, nine hours and 44 minutes. He also raised [£88,080 for two children’s charities](http://www.andrew.rowtheatlantic.com/).  
  
The [Row For Freedom team](http://www.taliskerwhiskyatlanticchallenge.com/team/row-for-freedom), Julia Immonen, Debbie Beadle, Helen Leigh, Kate Richardson and Katie Pattison-Hart, came in 5th overall and set a double world record. They are the first five-woman team to row any ocean in the world and have broken the record for rowing the Atlantic in the fastest time by an all-female crew. On the voyage they battled waves up to 30 foot high, their steering system failed, their water-maker caught fire and the de-salinator broke.  The team is raising money for two charities, ECPAT UK and the A21 Campaign.

The [Row to Recovery team](http://www.taliskerwhiskyatlanticchallenge.com/team/row2recovery) came in seventh. The crew of six ex-servicemen, four of whom have severe injuries suffered during service in Afghanistan and Iraq, had to cope with a broken auto-helm, water de-salinator and rudder, as well as rowing through storms and high waves. On their arrival after 51 days at sea they received a message of congratulations from from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.  The team has raised nearly £700,000 for charity.
