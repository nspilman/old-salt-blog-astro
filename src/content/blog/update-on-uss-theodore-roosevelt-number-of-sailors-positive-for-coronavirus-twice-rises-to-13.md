![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/TRGuam-1.jpg)Yesterday, we posted about 5 sailors from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt who appeared to have contracted the coronavirus for a second time. That number has now risen to 13. 

[Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/16/uss-theodore-roosevelt-sailors-test-positive-coronavirus-261873) reports that the 13 Covid-positive sailors have been removed from the ship and are back in isolation on U.S. Naval Base Guam, according to the officials.

“This week, a small number of TR Sailors who previously tested COVID positive and met rigorous recovery criteria have retested positive,” said Navy spokesperson Cmdr. Myers Vasquez. “These protocols resulted in a small number of close contacts who were also removed from the ship, quarantined and tested.

At the end of April, when the Navy stopped releasing daily totals, the number of active cases hit 1,102. As of Thursday, more than 2,900 sailors had moved aboard the Roosevelt. More than a quarter of all sailors who have tested positive for Covid-19 have now recovered, according to the Navy.

In addition to the coronavirus outbreak, one sailor has been diagnosed with tuberculosis and has been removed from the ship, Vasquez said.

Tuberculosis, or TB, is a bacterial infection that affects the lungs and carries symptoms similar to Covid-19 such as coughing, fever and difficulty breathing. TB kills 1.5 million people per year worldwide — more than any other infectious disease.
