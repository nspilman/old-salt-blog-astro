The 180′ tall ship [HMS *Bounty*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_\(1960_ship\)) has sunk off the North Carolina coast.  At least 14 of the crew have been rescued.   There is considerable confusion about the remaining 2-3 crew members. The *Bounty* organization reported that 17 crew, wearing survival suits and life jackets, had been accounted for in two lifeboats.  The US Coast Guard now says that there 16 rather than 17 aboard the ship and that two are unaccounted for.  The most recent message on the *Bounty* [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HMSBounty) reads: *Please bear with us…There are so many conflicting stories going on now. We are waiting for some confirmation.*
