![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/usnsjohnlewis.jpg)Last Saturday, [USNS John Lewis (T-AO 205)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_John_Lewis_\(T-AO-205\)), the first in a new class of Navy oiler, was christened at NASSCO on the one-year anniversary of the congressman’s death.

It’s fitting that we honor John Lewis with this formidable ship, because John Lewis was a warrior. One of the mottos of the Navy is ‘Semper Fortis’ — ‘Always Courageous’ — and John Lewis was indeed always courageous,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who led a congressional delegation to the event on Saturday. “This ship will be a beacon to the world reminding all who see it of the persistence and courage of John Lewis.”

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/17/politics/us-navy-ship-john-lewis/index.html) notes that Lewis — the son of sharecroppers who survived a brutal beating by police during a landmark 1965 march in Selma, Alabama — served as the US representative for Georgia’s 5th Congressional District for more than three decades and was widely seen as a moral conscience of Congress because of his decades-long embodiment of the nonviolent fight for civil rights. The Democrat’s passionate oratory was backed by a long record of action that included, by his count, more than 40 arrests while demonstrating against racial and social injustice.

The General Dynamics-NASSCO shipyard in San Diego is building the first six Lewis-class oilers under a $3 billion contract. The Navy says it may need as many as 20 of the vessels. The ships will be operated by the Navy’s Military Sealift Command.

The vessel was given its name five years ago by Ray Mabus, who was secretary of the Navy under President Barack Obama. Mabus said at the time that he would name the first of the new oilers after civil rights leaders.

The names include gay rights activist Harvey Milk, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who was shot to death in 1978 by a former board member. NASSCO will launch the Harvey Milk in November. Mabus also named oilers after Lucy Stone and Sojourner Truth, who fought against slavery and for women’s rights.
