Baby/Grace

OK, this is odd.  A few days after New Years, a fisherman spotted a small dog treading water several miles from shore in Tampa Bay, on the west coast of Florida.  The dog, which was wearing a red collar and a pink rhinestone name tag, which read “Baby,” appeared well cared for, and other than being cold after paddling in the 68 degree water for who knows how long, was healthy. The dog was implanted with a pet microchip, which when scanned revealed the dog owner’s name. The strange thing is that the dog was reported missing two years ago and the phone number associated with the name on the microchip.

How “Baby” ended up treading water two miles from shore in Tampa Bay, two years after being reported missing, remains a mystery. The dog’s current caretakers attempted to track down the original owner. After having no luck, the mystery dog was adopted by [Kathy Klein of St. Petersburg, who renamed her Grace](http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/dog-found-in-tampa-bay-has-new-owner-new-name/2159812).
