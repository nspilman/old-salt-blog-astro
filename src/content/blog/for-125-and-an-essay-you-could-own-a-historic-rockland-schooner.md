![isaacevans](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/08/isaacevans.jpg)The 129 year old, 90 foot long schooner *[Isaac H. Evans](http://www.isaacevans.com/index.php),* sailing out of Rockland, Maine could be yours for $125 and a 200 word essay. [Captain Brenda Thomas, owner and master of the schooner, hopes to attract up to 8,000 entries](http://bangordailynews.com/2015/08/04/news/midcoast/for-125-and-an-essay-you-could-own-a-historic-rockland-schooner/), which would raise up to $1 million. The schooner was built as a Delaware oyster schooner in 1886 but has been sailing in the Maine “windjammer fleet” since 1973. The schooner is a National Historic Landmark. While the schooner is outfitted to carry passengers, the new owner does not necessarily have to continue that line of work. Captain Thomas says that “*the person doesn’t have to operate it as a schooner. They could live on it, turn it into a restaurant. A Scout group could get it and offer sail training. There are no strings attached.*”

To have a shot at owning the schooner, one must pay the $125 entry fee and write an essay of up to 200 words on the theme: *Why I would like to own the Maine Windjammer Isaac H. Evans?* The deadline for submissions is Oct. 31, but Captain Thomas reserves the right to extend the deadline for another 60 days.
