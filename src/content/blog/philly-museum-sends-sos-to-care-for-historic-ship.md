USS Olympia

Terrible news from Phildelphia.

[Philadelphia maritime museum says it can’t afford to care for historic USS Olympia](http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=9955097)

*A Philadelphia maritime museum says it can no longer afford to care for a historic ship that served in the Spanish-American War.*  
  
*The [Independence Seaport Museum](http://www.phillyseaport.org/) is seeking a new owner for the [USS Olympia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Olympia_\(C-6\)), whose guns fired the first shots at the [Battle of Manila Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manila_Bay_\(1898\)) in 1898.*

*The museum estimates it would cost up to $30 million to tow, restore, interpret and endow the deteriorating vessel.*

*Museum officials say they have spent $5.3 million on the ship since acquiring it in 1996. But they say efforts to attract further public and private funding have failed.*

*The Olympia, docked in the Delaware River, contains a collection of paintings, photographs and artifacts. The attraction will close in September.*
