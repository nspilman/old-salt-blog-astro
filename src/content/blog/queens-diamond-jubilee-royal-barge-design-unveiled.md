With no disrespect implied to the Queen, I am a bit disappointed. At first glance the design appears to be a tarted-up excursion boat. On second glance, that is exactly what it is. Apparently the high-end Thames excursion boat, the *[Spirit of Chartwell](http://www.spiritofchartwell.com/home.aspx)*, has been donated for the purpose and is getting a royal makeover with a new color scheme, drapes and lots of gold leaf and bric-a-brac.

It appears that earlier designs may have been a bit more traditional.  A [Youtube video](http://youtu.be/uTb6vliZYrg) from what appears to be an earlier presentation from last April shows a smaller barge with a more 18th century feel to it.
