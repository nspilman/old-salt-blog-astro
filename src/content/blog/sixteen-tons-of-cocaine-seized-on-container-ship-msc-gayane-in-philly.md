In one of the largest drug seizures in United States history, [Federal authorities seized 15,500 kilos of cocaine](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Massive-Drug-Cache-Seized-at-Philadelphia-Shipping-Yard-Sources-Say-511455802.html) hidden in seven shipping containers on the container ship [MSC *Gayane*](https://www.hafen-hamburg.de/en/vessel/msc-gayane-imo-9770763---47644) in the port of Philadelphia. The street value of the drugs is estimated to be worth $1 billion. The MSC *Gayane’s* previous port calls included ports in Colombia, Chile, Panama, and the Bahamas. Authorities believe that the drug-laden containers were put aboard in the Bahamas. Members of the ship’s crew have been arrested and federally charged as the investigation continues, authorities said.  MSC *Gayane* is a 9,962 TEU Liberian flag containership built in 2018.

The current bust far surpasses the previous record for seized drugs set last March, when nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine worth around $15 million was seized on the 9,400 TEU container ship, [MSC *Desiree*](http://www.vesseltracking.net/ship/msc-desiree-9745665), on its way from Colombia to Europe.

Note: We have received comments over the quantities of drugs seized. The currents reports are that the total was 15,500 kilograms. The initial reports were 15,000 kilos. The two figures translate into 15.5 and 15.0 metric tonnes, respectively, or around 17 and 16.5 short tons. Previously we mixed short tons and kilos which was confusing. We have updated the post to use only metric units.
