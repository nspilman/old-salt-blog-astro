On Monday, November 22, 1869, the composite clipper ship [*Cutty Sark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark), built for the Jock Willis Shipping, Line was launched from the [Scott & Linton shipyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_Linton#Scott_and_Linton_shipbuilders) on the River Leven in Scotland. The *Cutty Sark,* one of the last tea clippers to be built, and one of the fastest and, perhaps most remarkably, is one of only two clipper ships to survive today. Now [fully restored in a drydock in Greenwich, UK](https://www.rmg.co.uk/cutty-sark), the historic tea clipper is the centerpiece of a year-long celebration of its 150th anniversary.

Because there are, to my knowledge, no photographs of the Cutty Sark’s launch, here is a news-reel video of her “last voyage” — on her way to Greenwich to be restored in 1953.
