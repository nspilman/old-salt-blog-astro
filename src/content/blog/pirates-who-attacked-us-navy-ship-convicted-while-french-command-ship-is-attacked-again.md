USS Nicholas

Five Somali pirates who attacked the *[USS Nicholas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nicholas_\(FFG-47\))*, an Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate,  in a wildly misguided attempt to hijack the ship in a late night attack last April, were [convicted of piracy](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/25/world/africa/25pirates.html?scp=2&sq=pirates%20virginia&st=cse) in a court in Virginia.  The prosecution said that this is the first piracy conviction in an American courtroom since 1819.  The pirates face mandatory life terms.  
  
Also this week, [the French Command ship, *La Somme*, was attacked again by Somali pirates](http://www.african-bulletin.com/watch/252-somalia-attack-on-a-french-navy-ship.html).  The French captured “*six alleged hijackers, fuel and equipment that is clearly anything but not for fishing*.”  *[La Somme](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://babyboomeradvisorclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/La%2520Somme.jpg&imgrefurl=http://babyboomeradvisorclub.com/2009/10/09/somali-pirates-attack-french-war-ship/&h=290&w=399&sz=29&tbnid=lXXkuvYVftP4CM:&tbnh=90&tbnw=124&prev=/images%3Fq%3DLa%2BSomme%2Bship&zoom=1&q=La+Somme+ship&usg=__MRXNostrdDrCH1aTlNP8HNmkL2k=&sa=X&ei=T3DuTIyTBIGKlwfH5KXpDA&ved=0CCIQ9QEwAQ)* was last attacked by pirates in October of 2009.

In Germany, [ten Somali pirates are going on trial in Hamburg](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,730516,00.html) this week, in what will be the first German piracy trial in centuries.  The Somalis are charged with attempting to hijack the German cargo ship *Taipan,* which was 500 nautical miles off the Horn of Africa, last April.   The pirates were arrested by Dutch commandos.  A video of the commando action was recorded on a helmet cam, below.
