*“I had prepared for the storm and never imagined that a group of orcas would attack me in the Strait of Gibraltar. Large animals about 5 meters long, a family group, I’m told, that for about half an hour battered Aspra, especially its rudder.*

*I had positioned myself in a southern corridor with few ships to get some rest! The attack began with blows. I followed the procedure I had read: turned off the autopilot and sonar, lowered the sails… it was all in vain, after the first hits, the hydraulic part of the autopilot exploded with all the oil in the bilge, the cables tangled on the quadrant… adrift in the middle of the Strait with ships passing by.*

*I called [Tarifa MRCC](https://www.globalsarhub.com/mrcc.php?mrcc=MRCC-Tarifa) for help, thinking they would tow me. While I was waiting for them, I managed to untangle the mess and free the rudder, which still seemed to turn. I quickly mounted the emergency tiller and, to my surprise, saw that I could still steer. This way, under engine power, I steered 12 miles to the port of Tarifa escorted by the tug that had meanwhile arrived.*

*Of course, it started pouring rain and blowing gusts, but all was well—the docking maneuver was a real show… with a happy ending. Unfortunately, there I discovered that the rudder blade had been mutilated. The shaft and bearings seem intact; I hope I can make it home like this. If I covered 12 miles, maybe I can make it 800. In the coming days I’ll understand better, but now, after 30 hours of wakefulness, I’m going to sleep.  
Happy Easter  
Alessandro*

*Aspra*  is now in port in Tarifa where repairs are being made to the rudder and the autopilot.
