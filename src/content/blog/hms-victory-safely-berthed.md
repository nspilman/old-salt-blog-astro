![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/victoryprops.jpg)Here is a new video from [The National Museum of the Royal Navy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ppRbUdj-XrSIn-6YHGP3w) describing the 20 year-long project to secure [HMS *Victory*](https://www.hms-victory.com/) in her dock at Portsmouth’s Historic Dockyard.

As we [posted back in August 2020](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/08/hms-victory-figuratively-afloat-in-the-portsmouth-historic-dockyard/), when HMS *Victory* went into drydock in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard in 1922, she was supported by 22 steel cradles. In the almost 100 years that she has remained on the dock, the historic ship’s 3,500-tonne hull had been to slowly collapse in on itself. To save the ship, the cradles have been replaced by an innovative system of 134 “props” to distribute the load across the hull.

The installation of the new high-tech props has also allowed The National Museum of the Royal Navy to install a walkway underneath the ship giving visitors a more intimate experience of this iconic ship.
