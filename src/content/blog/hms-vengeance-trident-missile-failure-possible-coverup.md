![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/veng1.jpg)Last June, the Royal Navy submarine [HMS *Vengeance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Vengeance_\(S31\)) test fired a dummy [Trident II D5 nuclear ballistic missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UGM-133_Trident_II) while cruising in the Atlantic off the coast of Florida.  The missile was supposed to fly 5,600 miles (9,012 km) to a target at sea off the west coast of Africa.  Instead, the missile veered towards the US.

There are no reports that the missile hit the US mainland. On the other hand, there are very few reports about the incident at all.  T[he failed test was allegedly covered up](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/no-10-covered-up-trident-missile-fiasco-hch3shsrn) in the weeks before the British Parliament approved a £40billion Trident renewal program.

Theresa May, Britain’s prime minister, has refused to say whether she knew about an unarmed Trident missile that reportedly failed when it was test-fired off the coast of Florida last year. Ms. May told [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38708823) she has total confidence in Britain’s Trident nuclear launching system, but didn’t confirm or deny a newspaper report about the alleged failure of a ballistic missile designed to carry nuclear warheads.

Opponents of the Trident program are now demanding an inquiry into the reported missile failure and the possible cover-up.
