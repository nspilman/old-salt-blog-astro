![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pilotwhalesrower.jpg)Yesterday, we [posted about the tragic stranding](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2024/07/pod-of-77-pilot-whales-die-after-stranding-on-orkney-beach/) on a beach in the Orkneys that resulted in the deaths of 77 long-finned pilot whales.  Here is a much more cheerful story involving a pod of pilot whales and a solo transatlantic rower.

[Tom Waddington set off on an attempt to break the world record](https://mindoarmatter.com/) for rowing solo across the Atlantic, while also raising money for the [mental health charity Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/). Last Sunday, some 100 nautical miles off the coast of Newfoundland, he had an unexpected visit by what he estimates was a pod of at least a thousand long-finned pilot whales that playfully swam around his boat for several hours.

“This is so cool,” Waddington said as he took a video of the whales’ antics that he posted on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tomwaddington_skier/?hl=en). With a laugh, he added, “I love it, but I’m scared they’re gonna hit my rudder.”

“They were just playing and going under the boat and I was taking videos,” he said on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tom.waddington.14/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tomwaddington_skier/?hl=en), describing hundreds of whales around him. Then one of the whales slammed into the side of his light boat.

“And I was like, Oh my God. And suddenly it turned from David Attenborough into Moby Dick. And I was really scared.”

Eventually, the whales left the boat and its sole occupant with a rare story about crossing the Grand Banks, the large fishery at the edge of the North American continental shelf.

“It was absolutely incredible,” Waddington said.

The encounter didn’t harm the boat, or its progress across open water.

Between favorable winds and waves, and what Waddington called “whale-fueled adrenaline,” his boat is making good progress, he added.
