View from Astern, June 2020

When [HMS *Victory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Victory) went into drydock in the [Portsmouth Historic Dockyard](https://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/) in 1922, she was supported by 22 steel cradles. In the almost 100 years that she has remained on the dock, the historic ship’s 3,500-tonne hull had been to slowly collapse in on itself. To save the ship, the cradles have been replaced by an innovative system of 134 “props” that replicate the loads HMS *Victory* would have encountered while afloat. The ship will now be, at least figurately, floating in the drydock.

The new props, a collaboration between the [National Museum of the Royal Navy](https://www.nmrn.org.uk/) and [BAE Systems](https://www.baesystems.com/en/article/hms-victory-afloat-again-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-100-years), are more than a series of struts to support the hull. Each prop contains sensors and hydraulics to monitor the load on the ship’s hull and adjust the weight being carried by each strut to most effectively support the 255-year-old wooden structure.

In addition to helping preserve the integrity of the ship’s hull, the new support system has another major benefit. The old steel cradles blocked the view of HMS *Victory’s* hull.  Visitors will now be able to see the shape of the hull through the supporting struts.

“It’s an amazing, breath-taking space to be in,” said [Matthew Sheldon, the museum’s head curator](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2020/august/11/20200811-visitors-get-to-see-underneath-victory-for-first-time?fbclid=IwAR1Qkmio_skx6a6c8vwlbnPbY9c5zqz4RsZ7a1_JgDNd79hZb4BU-GInliM). “I’ve been here 26 years and I’ve never seen *Victory* like this before. The views of her bow and rudder are fabulous. You can get up close to the ship like never before.”

“It’s been a unique endeavour for a unique ship,” said Rob Hanway, Victory Programme Manager from [BAE Systems](https://www.baesystems.com/en/article/hms-victory-afloat-again-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-100-years) which led the complex project.

“There’s never been anything quite like this before – a combination of the old and the new. Props have been used on cranes, but never on such a scale.

“Over the past 18 months, as we’ve taken out the old cradle, the sheer daylight flooding into the dock meant you noticed the difference and she looks pretty impressive. It’s been an absolute pleasure to work on her.”

The public can view Victory – and the rest of the sights in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard – when it re-opens on August 24. Numbers to the site will be limited to 250 per hour initially, and all visitors must book online in advance via: [www.historicdockyard.co.uk/tickets-and-offers](https://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/tickets-and-offers)
