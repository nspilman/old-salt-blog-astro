I saw it on the Internet so it must be true!  The [Lagarfljóts Worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagarflj%C3%B3t_Worm) has gone viral.  A video of what appears to be a large serpent-like creature swimming in the the glacial river, Jökulsá í Fljótsdal, in east Iceland, has been viewed over a million times on Youtube.  It has also been featured on television and has been written about in newspapers from around the world.  For some, the video is proof of the existence of the legendary [Lagarfljótsormurinn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagarflj%C3%B3t_Worm), a great serpent-like beast that is said to live in [Lagarfljót lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagarflj%C3%B3t), which is 25 miles long and 367 feet deep. There have been “serpent” sightings in the lake as recently as 1998, as well as dating back to a reference in the Icelandic Annals of 1345.

Loren Coleman, director of the International [Cryptozoology Museum](http://cryptozoologymuseum.com/) in Portland, Maine, and author of *[Field Guide to Lake Monsters and Sea Serpents](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585422525/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1585422525)* is considerably more skeptical about the “serpent” on the video.  Writing on his website, [Cryptomundo](http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/iceland-wurm/), “*Frankly, this video shows something that looks like a constructed snake-like object, with rigid sections, being propelled through the water…  It seems someone attempting this fakery, perhaps by using a robot with tarps, fish nets, or trash bags (a favorite for watery hoaxers)…*”
