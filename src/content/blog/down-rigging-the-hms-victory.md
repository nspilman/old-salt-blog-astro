Recent surveys have indicated that Nelson’s flagship, [HMS *Victory*](http://www.hms-victory.com/), was leaking, suffering from rot and being pulled apart by her own weight.   Now, as the first part of a major restoration project, the ship is being down-rigged. Twenty six miles of rigging will be removed.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for passing the news along.
