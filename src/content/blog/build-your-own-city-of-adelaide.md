*Former Curiosity Show host and science communicator Dr Rob Morrison is blowing wind into the sails of a long-running campaign to rescue the clipper ship City of Adelaide.*

*“Learning about sailing ships teaches you about geography, weather, mathematics, science, technology and social history,” Dr Morrison said.  “It is a rich field for educators.”*

*The experienced ship bottler has made miniatures of the One and All, the Falie, Endeavour, Investigator, Edward John Eyre’s cutter, Waterwitch and many more.*

*But this pattern cuts a few corners, bringing the art and science of ship building well within reach of primary school children.*

*Dr Morrison is a member of the group working to return the real vessel, which belongs to the Scottish Maritime Museum, to South Australia and develop a City of Adelaide Seaport Village in Port Adelaide. The village would become a maritime display of historic vessels, including the Nelcebee, the Falie and the Yelta.*

*The 175th Jubilee project would commemorate the birth of the state of South Australia, due to be celebrated in 2011.*
