[Unlucky in love? Try speed dating Nelson-style!](http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/people/Unlucky-in-love-Try-speed.6695097.jp)

*His romance with mistress Lady Hamilton is the stuff of legend – and singletons will hope to harness some of Lord Nelson’s pulling power at a speed dating event with a difference.*

*In an age where the search for love is often confined to the internet and the closest thing to penning a love letter is sending a text message, the National Museum of the Royal Navy will host a Georgian-themed speed dating event – mixing up the 21st and 18th centuries like never before.*  
  
*Wearing Georgian masks, 50 hopefuls will mingle for four minutes at a time at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard in a bid to find someone special.*

*The dating event on Saturday, February 12, will be held in the museum’s opulent Nelson gallery, an exhibition dedicated to the life of the famous admiral, who died leading Britain to victory at the Battle of Trafalgar.*
