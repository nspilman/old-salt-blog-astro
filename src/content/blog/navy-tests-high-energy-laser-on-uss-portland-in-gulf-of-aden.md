![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/portlandlaser.jpg)In 2014, we [posted about the deployment of a prototype 30-kilowatt-class Laser Weapon System](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/11/update-us-navy-deploys-laser-weapon-on-uss-ponce-in-the-persian-gulf/) (LAWS) on the [USS *Ponce*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Ponce_%28LPD-15%29), an Austin-class amphibious transport dock, for field testing in the Persian Gulf.

Last week, the Navy announced that the amphibious transport dock ship [USS *Portland* (LPD 27)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Portland_\(LPD-27\)) conducted a high-energy laser weapon system demonstration, Dec. 14, while sailing in the Gulf of Aden. 

In a [statement](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/411139/uss-portland-tests-high-energy-laser-weapon-system-gulf-aden), the Navy said that the Solid State Laser – Technology Maturation Laser Weapons System Demonstrator (LWSD) Mark 2 MOD 0 aboard *Portland* successfully engaged a static surface training target. Portland previously tested the LWSD in May 2020 when it successfully disabled a small unmanned aerial system while operating in the Pacific Ocean. The LWSD is considered a next-generation follow-on to the Laser Weapon System (LaWS) that afloat forward staging base USS *Ponce* (AFSB(I)-15) tested for three years while operating in the Middle East.

*Portland* is part of the Essex Amphibious Ready Group that includes amphibious assault ship USS *Essex* (LHD 2), dock landing ship USS *Pearl Harbor* (LSD 52) and embarked Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The units departed San Diego in August and began operating in the U.S. 5th Fleet region in September.
