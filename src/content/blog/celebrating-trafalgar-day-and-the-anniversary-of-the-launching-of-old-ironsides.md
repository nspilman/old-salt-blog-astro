![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/trafalgar.jpg)Two hundred and fifteen years ago today, in 1805, the Royal Navy, commanded by [Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Nelson,_1st_Viscount_Nelson), defeated the combined French and Spanish fleets in the Atlantic off [Cape Trafalgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar).  The decisive victory ended French plans to use the combined fleet to take control of the English Channel and enable Napoleon’s Grande Armée to invade England. Tragically, Nelson was shot by a French musketeer and died shortly before the battle ended. Today is celebrated as [Trafalgar Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Day) to commemorate Nelson and his greatest victory.

Today also happens to be the 226th anniversary of the launching of the [USS *Constitution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution), launched on October 21, 1794. Nicknamed “Old Ironsides,”  after round shot from HMS *Guerriere* bounced off her sides in a battle during the War 1812, USS *Constitution* is the oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy and the world’s oldest commissioned naval vessel still afloat.

[HMS *Victory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Victory), Nelson’s flagship in the Battle of Trafalgar, is the oldest commissioned warship in the world, being 30 years older than the *Constitution*.  The *Victory* however is on permanent exhibit in drydock in Portsmouth, so she is no longer afloat, allowing the *Constitution* to claim the title of the oldest floating commissioned naval vessel.
