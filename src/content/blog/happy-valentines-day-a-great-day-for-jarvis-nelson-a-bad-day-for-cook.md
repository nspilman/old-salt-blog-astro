The Battle of Cape St Vincent, 14 February 1797  
by Robert Cleveley

Happy Valentine’s Day! The day is named for one of [several martyrs named Valentine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day#Historical_facts).  Valentine of Rome and Valentine of Terni both have feast days on February 14th. The day is also associated with an old Roman fertility festival [Lupercalia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupercalia).  February 14th is also an auspicious day in nautical history.

On February 14, 1797, in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, 15 British ships of the line defeated 27 Spanish ships, earning Admiral Sir John Jervis the title of Earl St Vincent.  Captain Horatio Nelson was knighted as a member of the Order of the Bath for his notable valor in capturing two Spanish ships by boarding.

February 14, 1779, was less happy for the great explorer, Captain James Cook, who was killed in a disagreement over a stolen boat in Kealakekua Bay, Hawaii.
