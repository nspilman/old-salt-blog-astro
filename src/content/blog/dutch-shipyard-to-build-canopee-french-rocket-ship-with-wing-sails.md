The Dutch shipyard [Neptune Marine has begun construction of the sailing cargo vessel *Canopée*](https://www.neptunemarine.com/neptune-has-started-to-build-the-first-large-sailing-cargo-vessel-the-canopee-ever-made/), which will transport Ariane 6 rockets from Europe to the launch site in Kourou in French Guyana. The ship will feature 1,500 square meter sails to lower fuel consumption and emissions.

The cutting of steel was started just before last Christmas and the first bottom sections are under construction. The outfitting completion will be executed at Neptune Hardinxveld. Delivery of the vessel is scheduled end of 2022 after a series of trials and tests.

The 121-metre long *Canopée* will be equipped with four 30-metre high [Oceanwings](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/vplp-design-signs-its-first-ocean-transport-ship-equipped-with-oceanwings-wings/), automated and reefable soft wingsails, which should save around 35% on fuel consumption.

[Project Cargo Journal](https://www.projectcargojournal.com/shipping/2021/01/05/neptune-marine-contracted-to-build-futuristic-ariane-rocket-ship/?gdpr=accept) reports that the vessel will be operated by Alizés, a joint venture of French shipping companies Jifmar Offshore Services and Zephyr et Borée which has been set up especially for this project. The company won the Ariane Group’s tender a for a new transport concept in 2019, beating among others the large French shipping company Louis Dreyfus Armateurs, which still owns this transport today. According to Alizés, the *Canopée* is a prototype, but it is not clear how many ships in total will be built.
