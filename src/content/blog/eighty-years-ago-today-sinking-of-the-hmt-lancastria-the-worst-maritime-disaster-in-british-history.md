![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lancastria2.jpg)On June 17, 1940, the HMT *Lancastria* was sunk by German bombers near the French port of Saint-Nazaire. An estimated 4,000 people died in the sinking. Fewer than 2,500 survived. It was the worst maritime disaster in British history, worse than the Titanic and the Lusitania combined. While often described as forgotten history, that is not accurate. Rather than being forgotten, the tragic sinking was largely covered up for almost 70 years. 

Several weeks after the evacuation at Dunkirk, there were still more than 100,000 troops and civilians in need of evacuation from France. The Cunard passenger liner *Lancastria* had been requisitioned by the British government. Although the ship configured as a troopship had a capacity of 2,180 including 330 crew, the captain was ordered to take as many people aboard as possible. Estimates of passengers embarked range from 5,000 to 7,200. 

The *Lancastria* was struck by three or four bombs dropped by German [Junkers Ju 88](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_88 "Junkers Ju 88") bomber aircraft and capsized within twenty minutes. The ship sank around 5 nautical miles south of Chémoulin Point in the Charpentier roads, around 9 nautical miles from St. Nazaire. Only 2,477 of the passengers and crew survived. 

The loss of the Lancastria was a shock to the British government which immediately sought to cover it up. Churchill said, “*The newspapers have got quite enough disaster for today, at least.*”  In his memoirs, Churchill stated that he had intended to release the news a few days later, but that events in France “crowded upon us so black and so quickly that I forgot to lift the ban.”

British newspapers were not allowed to write about the disaster. Survivors were instructed not to speak a word about the *Lancastria* even to friends and family. The news broke in America about a week later in the New York Times. Several British papers subsequently also reported on the disaster but the news was slow to spread. 

“The trouble with the story of the Lancastria is it doesn’t fit with the grand narrative of that period – the miraculous evacuation of Dunkirk, and the Battle of Britain,” reflects [Mark Hirst, the grandson of one of the survivors.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-33092351)  “No amount of spin can turn the story of the Lancastria into something triumphant.”

A memorial to the *Lancastria* was unveiled on the sea-front at St Nazaire  in June 1988, “in proud memory of more than 4,000 who died and in commemoration of the people of Saint Nazaire and surrounding districts who saved many lives, tended wounded and gave a Christian burial to victims.”

The site of *Lancastria*‘s wreck lies in French territorial waters and is therefore ineligible for protection under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986; however, at the request of the British Government, in 2006 the French authorities gave the site legal protection as a war grave.

In October 2011, the [Lancastria Association of Scotland erected a memorial](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/hmt-lancastria-finally-honored-a-secret-sacrifice-no-more/) to the victims on the site where the ship was built, the former Dalmuir shipyard at Clydebank.
