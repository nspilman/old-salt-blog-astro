The *Mayflower II* was built at the Upham Shipyard in Brixham, UK and delivered in 1957.

A new replica of the *Mayflower* is now under construction in Harwich, Essex, England. They have are close to completing the farming of the keel. The charity, [Harwich Mayflower Project](http://www.harwichmayflower.com/), aims to raise £4m to complete the reconstruction by 2020, the 400th anniversary of the famous voyage. The charity, which has already helped train 300 young people in skills such as carpentry, hopes its training centre will act as a “legacy” of the ship build.
