![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/BHR.jpg)Researchers believe that wreckage found off the coast of Filey in Yorkshire is from the American warship [USS *Bonhomme Richard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bonhomme_Richard_\(1765\)).  The ship, under the command of John Paul Jones, fought a four-hour battle with HMS *Serapis* off nearby Flamborough Head in 1779. Maritime historian Tim Akers, 60, working with British specialist satellite firm Merlin Burrows, located the wreck last month.

Mr. Akers spoke to the UK’s [Express](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1039412/shipwreck-found-usa-yorkshire-uss-bonhomme-richard-john-paul-jones-american-revolutionary), saying, “On our very first dive we knew we had found the BHR. From the finds and identifiable evidence, combined with the descriptions of the battle and both ships logs, we are convinced this is indeed the famous ship.”

Previous diving expeditions discovered a wrecked wooden ship, but it was never confirmed as the Bonhomme.

“Our wreck is littered with objects which can be identified in relation to the battle and burning. Our underwater filming clearly shows the burst guns, multiple artifacts and cannon balls. Ship stern decoration, ships bells, a figure head of a rampant lion and rigging are also all visible.”

HMS *Serapis* ultimately surrendered to Jones and the *Bonhomme Richard.* The *Bonhomme Richard,* however, was damaged in the battle that it subsequently sank. Several expeditions have tried and failed to identify the shipwreck, including one led by the US Navy. 

The [Battle of Flamborough Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Flamborough_Head) was a strategic victory for the Americans and a tactical victory of the British. In a ship-to-ship battle, John Paul Jones defeated a British warship, which was a great morale booster for the Americans and their French allies and a shock to the British Navy. On the other hand, the American squadron outnumbered and outgunned the British. The Royal Navy ships were escorting a convoy of more than 50 merchant ships, all of which escaped safely.
