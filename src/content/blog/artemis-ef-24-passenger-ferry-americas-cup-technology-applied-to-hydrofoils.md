![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/artemisferry.jpg)[Artemis Technologies](https://www.artemistechnologies.co.uk/), an applied technologies spin-off from the [Artemis Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_Racing) America’s Cup team, has announced its latest design, the [EF-24 passenger ferry](https://www.artemistechnologies.co.uk/ef-24-passenger-ferry/). The ferry is a 100% electric hydrofoil vessel with a capacity for 150 passengers and an operating range of 115 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 25 knots while producing zero emissions. The new design is said to save up to 85% in fuel costs compared to conventional diesel ferries.

[TechTimes](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/281057/20220926/electric-flying-ferry-artemis-technologies-ef-24-fly-across-water.htm) reports that Artemis Technologies, headquartered in Belfast, is led by CEO, Dr. Iain Percy, a four-time America’s Cup veteran and two-time Team GB Olympic sailing winner.

In 2024, a prototype service between Belfast and the neighboring city of Bangor will be launched by the 24-meter vessels. The first ferry constructed will be known as Zero.

The ferry is one of several zero-emission ships being created by Artemis Technologies as part of a £60 million ($58 million) initiative to design and produce green transportation options for the maritime sector. 

Artemis also launched what it claimed as a “world first” [commercially viable hydrofoil workboat](https://newatlas.com/marine/artemis-technologies-electric-foiling-workboat/) earlier this year.
