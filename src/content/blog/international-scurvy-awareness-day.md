May 2nd is [International Scurvy Awareness Day!](http://www.limestrong.com/index.htm) The festivities appear to be sponsored by a group calling itself [Lime Strong.](http://www.limestrong.com/) I am not sure whether this is an individual or a marketing arm for lime growers. Whichever it may be, we are happy to support scurvy awareness.
