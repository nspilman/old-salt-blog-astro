This weekend, the [Maritime Museum of San Diego is celebrating the 155th birthday](https://sdmaritime.org/latest-news/celebrating-star-of-indias-155-years/) of the [*Star of India*](https://sdmaritime.org/visit/the-ships/star-of-india/) by taking her for a sail. The museums other ships [*Californian*](https://sdmaritime.org/visit/the-ships/californian/), [*San Salvador*](https://sdmaritime.org/visit/the-ships/san-salvador/), and [*America*](https://sdmaritime.org/visit/the-ships/america/) are sailing along with with the *Star of India*. 

It has been five years since the grand old iron ship, built in 1863 as the *Euterpe,* was last fully underway under sail. The *Star of India* is the oldest ship still sailing regularly and also the oldest iron-hulled merchant ship still floating. The ship circumnavigated the globe 21 times.
