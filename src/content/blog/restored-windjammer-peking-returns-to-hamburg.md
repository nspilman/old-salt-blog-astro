In all her former glory, the restored [Flying P Liner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner) [*Peking*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_\(ship\)) has returned to her home port of Hamburg. Four years ago, [we posted about the *Peking*‘s departure](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/09/saying-goodbye-peking-windjammer-leaves-south-street-last-time/) from New York’s South Street Seaport. During the summer of 2017, [she was carried across the Atlantic on a heavy lift ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/07/windjammer-peking-loaded-combi-dock-ii-voyage-home/) and underwent a three-year restoration at [Peters Werft shipyard](https://www.peters-werft.de/en/) in Wewelsfleth, Germany.

This week, the *Peking* was towed back to Hamburg, greeted by a flotilla of supporters and throngs of wellwishers along the riverbanks. The ship will be the centerpiece of a new [German Port Museum](https://shmh.de/en/german-port-museum), part of [Historic Museums Hamburg](https://shmh.de/en#), scheduled to be completed by 2025. In the meantime, the Peking is alongside her provisional berth on the Bremen Quay.

“[With the *Peking*, Hamburg is gaining a new landmark,” Hamburg Mayor Peter Tschenscher said](https://www.hamburg-news.hamburg/en/standort/tall-ship-peking-returns-hamburg). “During a history of more than 100 years, the Peking rounded Cape Horn 34 times, survived two world wars, and spent more than 40 years as a museum ship on a Manhattan pier.” The Hamburg Historical Museums Foundation now aims to fit out the ship over the months ahead before moving it to its final berth along the Holthusen Quay where it will serve as a museum ship. Eighty-eight years after the *Peking* sailed from the Port of Hamburg for the last time, it is now providing a view of the planned German Port Museum. The tall ship is expected to be ready to accept visitors in the summer of 2021. Until then, the ship can be viewed from the quayside during Hamburg Port Museum’s opening hours.

*Peking* was built in 1911 at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg for the German shipowner, F. Laeisz, one of the famous [Flying P Liners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner), which were among the last of the great sailing ships to round Cape Horn carrying cargo. *Peking* made voyages from Europe to the west coast of South America with general cargo and returned filled with nitrates for use in the making of fertilizer and explosives. The windjammer was made famous by the Irving Johnson film *Around Cape Horn* which documented her 1929 passage around the southern tip of South America in hurricane conditions.  After 1933, the *Peking* served as the school ship, *Arethusa II*, mooring on the River Medway in Great Britain.  She was purchased as a museum ship by the South Street Seaport Museum in 1975.
