A Look at SkySails](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/06/14/go-fly-a-kite-a-look-at-skysails/))  One possibly unforeseen hazard of the SkySails became clear last week when an aircraft and a Skysail deployed from a ship had a close encounter.

*Eurocontrol is alerting aviation authorities worldwide of potential new collision threats due to ships that have begun experimenting with large high-flying kites or sails for auxiliary propulsion.*

*The action comes after a* [*15 September incident*](http://www.eurocontrol.int/safety/public/standard_page/safety_alert_board.html) *in which an aircraft descending over the southern North Sea reported seeing a kite or sail flying at approximately 305m (1,000ft) height “just below the clouds” ahead of a ship as it headed into port.*
