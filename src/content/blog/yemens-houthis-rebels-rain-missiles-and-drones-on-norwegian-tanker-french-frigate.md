![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/12/frenchfrigateL.jpg)Last Saturday, Yemen’s Houthi rebels announced that the organization would [target any ships heading to or from Israel,](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-houthis-say-they-will-target-ships-red-sea-en-route-israel-2023-12-09/) regardless of their nationality, and warned all international shipping companies against dealing with Israeli ports.

On Monday, the group attacked the [MT *Strinda*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:384991/mmsi:259096000/imo:9330771/vessel:STRINDA), a Norwegian bio-diesel tanker passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb, the strait that connects the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea. At least one missile struck the tanker, causing a fire. No casualties were reported in the attack.  

A Houthi spokesman said the MT *Strinda* was delivering oil to Israel, but the ship’s owners said it was headed to Italy with feedstock for biofuel.

French guided-missile frigate [FS *Languedoc*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_frigate_Languedoc) shot down a drone while patrolling nearby, Naval News reported.

“*Languedoc* which was patrolling the area intercepted and destroyed a drone directly threatening the *Strinda*. The French Navy ship then placed itself in position to protect the affected vessel, preventing the attempt to hijack the ship,” reads a [Naval News](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2023/12/french-frigate-languedoc-intercepts-yet-another-drone-from-yemen/) translation of the French Navy statement on the incident.

“The fire on board the *Strinda* was brought under control. No injuries were reported. The [USS *Mason*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Mason_\(DDG-87\)) then escorted the *Strinda* to the Gulf of Aden out of the threat zone. *Languedoc* has resumed its patrol towards the North.”

This is the third drone from Yemen that the French frigate has intercepted since Sunday. On December 9, the *Languedoc* shot down two drones that were heading straight toward it, coming from the coast of Yemen.
