Before and after Sandy

The [United States Coast Guard Notice to Mariners](http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/lnms/lnm01442012.pdf) reads simply – Old Orchard Shoals Light  STRUCT DEST. The [Old Orchard Shoals Light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Orchard_Shoal_Light) was built in 1893 in New York’s outer harbor off Staten Island near Great Kills Beach. The 51-foot tall cast iron [spark plug lighthouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkplug_lighthouse) stood for 119 years until Superstorm Sandy destroyed it on October 30th.
