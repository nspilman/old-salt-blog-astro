[AllOnScale](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.allonscale.nl%2F&sl=nl&tl=en&hl=&ie=UTF-8) in Rotterdam builds around 1,000 ships a year.  The ships are all rather small, however, ranging from around 20 cm to several meters. AllOnScale is a leading ship model maker specializing in the production of small series in scales from 1:300 to 1:2000. They also produce larger models and repair damaged models.  Their approach to the ancient art of model making is relatively high tech, relying on 3D modeling and numerical controlled manufacturing techniques. Nevertheless, much of the work still is done by hand.
