![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/buoy.jpg)A certain number of brass bells and gongs from bell and gong buoys off the coast of Maine have turned up missing and the US Coast Guard has recently issued a [press release](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCG/bulletins/1f407e7) asking the public’s help in identifying the thieves. The statement is a bit cryptic. It does not identify how many of what they describe as “brass sound signaling devices” have been stolen or from which buoys. (There is, however, a reward for information leading to the conviction of the thieves.) The press release goes on to say:

*The brass gongs and bells were attached to buoys to help mariners navigate safely during times of reduced visibility. They play a vital role in the safe passage of ships and mariners.*

*It is thought the high-dollar devices are being stolen and sold to nautical novelty shops or scrap metal yards. Federal officials are working closely with local law enforcement, shops, and scrap yards to identify perpetrators and reclaim the missing property.*

*Tampering with aids to navigation is a federal offense and can lead to fines up to $25,000 per day or up to one year in prison. Anyone with information leading to a conviction are eligible to receive up to one half of the fine imposed.*

*“These thefts not only reduce the reliability of our aids to navigation system and put lives at risk, but they also create a burden and expense to the tax payer for the buoy tenders and crews responsible for maintaining the aids,” said Lt. Matthew Odom, Sector Northern New England’s waterways management division chief.*

*Anyone with information regarding the missing sound signaling devices are urged to contact the Sector Northern New England command center at 207-767-0303.*
