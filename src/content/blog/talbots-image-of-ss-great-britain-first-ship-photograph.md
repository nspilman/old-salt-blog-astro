![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photossgreatbritain.jpg)Apparently, Monday was [World Photography Day](https://www.worldphotographyday.com/). In its honor, a bit belatedly, here is a photo of Brunel’s revolutionary ship, [SS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Great_Britain) *[Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Great_Britain),* taken in 1844. Not only is it believed to be the first photograph of the *Great Britain,* but it is also believed to be the first photograph of any ship. The image was captured by the pioneering English photographer, [William Henry Fox Talbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fox_Talbot), using the “calotype” process that he developed. 

The *Great Britain* was the longest passenger ship in the world from 1845 to 1854. She was designed by [Isambard Kingdom Brunel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel "Isambard Kingdom Brunel") (1806–1859), for the [Great Western Steamship Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Steamship_Company "Great Western Steamship Company")‘s [transatlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_crossing "Transatlantic crossing") service between [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol "Bristol") and [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"). While other ships had been built of iron or equipped with a [screw propeller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller_\(marine\) "Propeller (marine)"), *Great Britain* was the first to combine these features in a large ocean-going ship.
