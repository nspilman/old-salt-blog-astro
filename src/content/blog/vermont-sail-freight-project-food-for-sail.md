Earlier this week [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/10/a-barge-calls-in-brooklyn-manhattan-shopping-at-the-vermont-sail-freight-project/) about the [Vermont Sail Project](http://www.vermontsailfreightproject.com/) barge *Ceres* calling in New York harbor. Here is a wonderful short video from documentary filmmaker [Thomas Halaczinsky](http://vimeo.com/user22000675) capturing a portion of the first voyage of the *Ceres* down the Hudson River. Who knew that Erik Andrus, the project founder, director farmer and bodybuilder, could also play the accordion?

*How do farmers deliver fresh produce and dried goods to New York City? By sailboat! With this environment-friendly plan in mind, Vermont based Erik Andrus and many volunteers started building a 39 foot barge called Ceres. Six month later he set sail, bringing 15 tons of fresh produce, grains, rice and maple syrup to local markets along the Hudson river. On October 16th, Ceres completed her maiden voyage and arrived in New York.*
