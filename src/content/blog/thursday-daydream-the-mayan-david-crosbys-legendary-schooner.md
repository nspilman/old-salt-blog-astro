On one hand, this is a very interesting use of Youtube by a yacht broker selling a classic yacht.   Here [Bob Craven](http://www.yachtworld.com/bcys/bcys_0.html) gives us a tour, a bit of history and low key sales pitch on [David Crosby](http://www.davidcrosby.com/)‘s legendary schooner – *the Mayan*.   Beyond that the video makes for a nice daydream for those of us lacking the ready cash to buy such a boat but who still enjoy the music and the images.  The *Mayan* has been on the market since around 2009. See our post  from April 2010 when [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/04/28/for-sale-neil-young%E2%80%99s-classic-baltic-trader/) about [Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosby,_Stills,_Nash_&_Young) bandmate, Neil Young’s Baltic trader being for sale.
