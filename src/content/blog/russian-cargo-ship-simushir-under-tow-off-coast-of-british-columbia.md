Late Thursday night, the 9,405 DWT Russian general cargo ship [*Simushir*](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/9179385/vessel:SIMUSHIR) lost power while in a gale off [Haida Gwai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Gwaii)i, also known as the Queen Charlotte Islands, on the coast of British Columbia, Canada. By Friday morning, the ship was drifting in heavy weather roughly 25 kilometres off Moresby Island’s Tasu Sound, according to the Canadian Forces’ Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Victoria.  The ship was in danger of foundering, with 400 tons of bunker oil and 50 tons of diesel oil aboard.

Three vessels were dispatched to the stricken ship.  The CCGS [*Gordon Reid*](http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/Fleet/Vessel?vessel_id=67), an Offshore Patrol Vessel based in Victoria, British Columbia, was the first to arrive and succeeded in taking the *Simushir* under tow, despite difficult weather conditions. The Coast Guard vessel is reported to be towing the cargo ship away from the islands at 1.5 knots.  The tug [*Barbara Foss*](http://www.mxak.org/community/barbara_foss/barbara_foss.html) and the Canadian Coast Guard light icebreaker CCGS [*Sir Wilfrid Laurier*](http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/Fleet/Vessel?vessel_id=100)  are expected to arrive today to assist CCGS *Gordon Reid.*
