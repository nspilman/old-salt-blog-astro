![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/09/ggrboat.jpg)Ocean racing seems to have been taken over by boats made entirely of carbon fiber, costing slightly more than their weight in gold, as well being as festooned with foils, articulating keels and every high-tech whiz-bang device that millions of dollars can buy. There is something very appealing to the idea of reverting back to a simpler time with simpler boats and gear. 

The current [Golden Globe Race](https://goldengloberace.com/) is attempting to do just that. The Golden Globe racers all set out to race solo non-stop around the world in production boats equipped with only gear available in the first Golden Globe of 50 years ago. That means specifically: no GPS, chart plotters, electronic wind instruments, electric autopilots, electronic log, iPhone, satellite phones, digital cameras, computers, cd players, pocket calculators electronic clocks and watches, water makers, carbon fiber, Kevlar, spectra etc… so it is back to film cameras, cassette tapes, sextants, wind up clocks, trailing logs and Dacron sails, wind vanes, and typewriters.

The Golden Globe Race is roughly half over. How has the “retro race” worked out so far? 

The results are mixed. Of the 18 starters, only 8 are still actively in the race. What has gone wrong? Are there lessons to be learned? Three lessons seem clear.

**1\. Older is not always better.**

Tried and true old school-designs can be wonderful but are not always better than newer technology and materials. Many modern offshore sailboats use electro-hydraulic auto-pilots powered by solar cells, which was not available in 1968. The Golden Globe racers use self-steering wind vanes. Vanes do not require electrical power, but they can be complicated and are, relatively speaking, fragile. Of the first seven entrants to withdraw from the race, three left due to wind vane steering gear problems.

Likewise, one of the boats abandoned after being struck by a serious storm in the Southern Ocean happened to be a replica of Sir Robin Knox-Johnston’s famous yacht *Suhaili* in which he won the original Golden Globe race in 1968. 

**2\. Knowledge is power and safety**

The Golden Globe racers can get weather forecasts over single-sideband radio, but do not have access to weather routing. Two boats were dismasted and another damaged when they were caught in a nasty storm in the Southern Ocean. There is no guarantee that they would have avoided the weather entirely if they had access to weather routing and satellite communications, but they would have had a better chance of avoiding the reported 80-knot winds and high seas.  

**3\. When it all goes wrong, technology is essential**

When one of the two sailboats was dismasted, the captain suffered a serious back injury.  When that happened the sat communicators and GPS were broken out.  Because the rescuers knew the damaged vessel’s exact position they were able to rescue the sailor withing a few days. If the rate was truly “retro”, without the high tech communications and satellite positioning, the outcome could have been very different.

**Seeking a Middle Ground**

There must be some middle ground between the multi-million dollar carbon fiber sleds and the “retro facing” without GPS, solar panels or weather routing.  Paper charts and sextants are important backups to chart plotters but they are not necessarily better, just as barometers are useful for predicting the weather but weather routing can, at least potentially, save lives. 

I think it is clear that while “retro racing” has an emotional appeal, it has definite limitations.  The sea is a dangerous place and there is nothing wrong with using the best gear and equipment available.
