We recently [posted videos](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/09/video-of-the-battleship-uss-texas-in-drydock/) of the 110-year-old battleship [USS *Texas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Texas_\(BB-35\)) currently being repaired and refurbished in drydock at the Gulf Copper Shipyard in Galveston.  The *Texas* is the oldest remaining dreadnought battleship and only one of six surviving ships to have served in both World War I and World War II.

I still have vivid memories of visiting the battleship *Texas* as an elementary school kid. Playing on an anti-aircraft gun was particularly fun, as I recall.  Here is a [History Guy](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHistoryGuyChannel) video about the guns of the venerable battleship.
