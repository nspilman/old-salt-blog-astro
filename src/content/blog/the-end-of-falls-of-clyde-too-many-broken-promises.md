![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/08/Falls_of_Clyde1.jpg)[The State of Hawaii has notified](http://www.kitv.com/news/could-this-be-the-end-of-the-falls-of-clyde/32832112) the [Friends of Falls of Clyde](http://www.friendsoffallsofclyde.org/), the organization responsible for rescuing the historic ship of the same name, that the state plans to terminate its permit which allows the ship to be docked for free.  “*They received the ship from the Bishop Museum with the understanding it would go into dry dock quickly. It has been 6 years and it doesn’t appear we are any closer to putting it into dry dock*,” said Hawaii State Department of Transportation Deputy Director Darrell Young.  If anything, the organization’s finances have grown worse over time and the ship continues to deteriorate.

[Falls of Clyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_of_Clyde_%28ship%29) is the last four-masted full-rigged iron ship and the only surviving sailing oil tanker. The ship was launched in 1878 in Port Glasgow, Scotland, for the Fall Line. She became a museum ship in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1971, but was never properly maintained. In 2008, the [Bishop Museum](http://www.bishopmuseum.org/), which had control of the ship, was preparing to tow her out sea and scuttle her. In September 2008, the Friends of the Falls of Clyde, a non-profit group of volunteers, acquired the ship. Unfortunately, the organization has been longer on promises than on performance.  For six years, they have been promising that they would be dry docking the ship, as the first step toward restoration, yet nothing seems to be happening.

Back in 2008, [Hawaii Aloha Travel](http://www.hawaii-aloha.com/blog/2008/10/02/salvaging-the-falls-of-clyde/) reported, “*Bishop Museum is giving the 130-year-old ship to a community group that plans to restore it as an educational facility and tourist destination. …The Falls of Clyde will stay at Honolulu Harbor for a month or more before being towed to dry dock*.”

The dry docking in a month never happened.  A year later in 2009, [it was reported that](http://tallship.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/01/falls-of-clyde-drydocking-delayed.html), “*as a result of adverse weather conditions plans to dry dock the Falls of Clyde earlier this month have now been delayed.*” The 2009 drydocking never took place either.  In 2012, reports were that a [dry docking was imminent](http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/19085508/historic-ship-has-sights-set-on-restoration).  That didn’t happen.   The next dry docking plan was announced in 2014.  The news report read, “[Historic 4-masted iron hulled tanker heads to drydock.](http://www.kitv.com/news/-last-hurrah-for-falls-of-clyde/26180080)”  That docking didn’t happen, either.

Rather than effectively raising funds to restore the ship, the organization appears to be floundering. “*Looking at their tax filings over the years, their finances has been diminishing and we estimate they only have a few years left*,” said Hawaii State Department of Transportation’s Young.

The Friends of the Falls of Clyde has hurriedly begun a [crowding-sourcing fundraiser through Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/save-our-ship-falls-of-clyde) in an attempt to raise $1.5 million to finally dry dock the historic ship before they are thrown off the berth. In the last five days, they have successfully raised $1,150 of their $1,500,000 goal.  Sadly, good intentions and promises are not enough to restore a historic ship.
