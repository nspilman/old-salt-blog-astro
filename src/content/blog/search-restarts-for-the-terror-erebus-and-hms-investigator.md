![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/shipsfranklin.jpg)After a season’s delay due to lack of access to icebreakers, Parks Canada is renewing its search for Franklin’s ship’s *[Erebus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Erebus_\(1826\))* and *[Terror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Terror_\(1813\))*.  They will also be searching for the *[HMS Investigator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Investigator_\(1848\))*[,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Investigator_\(1848\)) a ship which was caught in the ice and sank when sent to search for Franklin.

*Already on the hunt in the Canadian Arctic for two of the world’s most storied shipwrecks — the lost Terror and Erebus of Sir John Franklin’s ill-fated polar expedition in the 1840s — Parks Canada is now preparing to search this summer for another famed vessel from that era, Canwest News Service has learned.*

*HMS Investigator, among the most famous of the ships sent to look for the Franklin Expedition after its disappearance gripped a distraught British public in the mid-1800s, became locked in the ice itself in 1851 and eventually sank in Mercy Bay, off Banks Island, in 1854.*

*Now, with Parks Canada planning to resume its search for Franklin’s ships in August near Nunavut’s King William Island, the federal agency has also scheduled a late-July probe for the Northwest Territories wreck site of the Investigator — a vessel with immense significance in polar history and in the establishment of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty.*

*Using side-scan sonar technology, heritage experts plan “to go and see if there are remains of the ship” in Mercy Bay, Marc-Andre Bernier, chief of underwater archeology at Parks Canada, said Friday.*

*The project will also include archeological excavations along the shore of Banks Island. That’s where the Investigator’s commander, Capt. Robert McClure, and his crew deposited a cache of supplies before abandoning their ice-locked vessel in 1853.*
