Definitely not a containership

I saw the headline and immediately shook my head.  There may indeed be an application for sails on bulk carriers, but containerships, well, not so much.  With a five high (or higher) stack of boxes on deck, containerships have exactly the stability they need – no more, no less.  Adding sails without removing cargo capacity could be a challenge.  I clicked on the link and had to smile.  The drawing was of a tanker with hybrid solar cell sails, and not a containership.  Tankers generally have no shortage of stability.  Even [Sail-World](http://www.sail-world.com) should know the difference between containerships and tankers.   I guess the moral of the story is that not all ships are containerships and you have to take what you read in the press with a proverbial grain of salt.    The designs by [Eco Marine Power](http://www.ecomarinepower.com/) look very interesting, nevertheless.
