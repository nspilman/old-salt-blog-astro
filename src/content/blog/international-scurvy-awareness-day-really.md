[![scurvy-awareness-day](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/scurvy-awareness-day.jpg)Once again, May 2nd](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/05/international-scurvy-awareness-day/) is [International Scurvy Awareness Day](http://www.limestrong.com/help.htm)! The festivities appear to be sponsored by a group calling itself [Lime Strong](http://www.limestrong.com/help.htm). I am not sure whether this is an individual or a marketing arm for lime growers. Nevertheless, there is nothing wrong with awareness. Squeeze some extra lime juice in your rum today. Thanks to Bob McKane for the heads up.
