I am not sure if it is irony or merely a confirmation that Faulkner was right – the past isn’t dead. It isn’t even past.  Not long after the [Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia announced](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/03/02/update-ss-olympia-stuck-in-philadelphia-by-sandbars-and-scandal/) that it didn’t have the money to care for the [cruiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Olympia_\(C-6\)) *[Olympia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Olympia_\(C-6\))*, (or even the money to dredge the channel to tow her away,) the US Navy has commissioned a new *[USS Dewey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Dewey_\(DDG-105\))*.  This is the third Navy ship named in honor of Admiral of the Navy [George Dewey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dewey), hero of the [Battle of Manila Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manila_Bay_\(1898\)) during the Spanish-American War.   Admiral Dewey’s flagship during the battle was, of course, the *USS* *Olympia*.
