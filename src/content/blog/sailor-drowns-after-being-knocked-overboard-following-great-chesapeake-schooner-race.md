On one schooner, the 2012 [Great Chesapeake Schooner Race](http://www.schoonerrace.org/) ended in tragedy.  Shortly after the 43-foot *Cuchulain* crossed the finish line at Windmill Point, at just after 4 p.m. on Friday, Paul Stephen Case, 68, of Racine Wisconsin was knocked overboard and drowned, while handling sails in gusty and choppy conditions.  Case was an avid sailor who had participated in sailing races around the world.  This was his second time racing in the Great Chesapeake Schooner Race. Our condolences to his friends and family.  Thanks to Gareth Hughes for passing along the sad news.
