The oldest surviving clipper clipper ship, *City of Adelaide*, was towed on its barge to Chatham where she will be fumigated. In mid-October, the 1864 built composite clipper ship will be moved to Greenwich, near the just slightly younger composite clipper, *Cutty Sark*, where a renaming ceremony will be held on October 18, with the Duke of Edinburgh in attendance. While we and most others have referred to the ship by her original name, she was renamed HMS *Carrick* after she was taken over by the Royal Navy as a training ship in 1923. The renaming ceremony will officially return the original name to the ship before she is transported by a heavy lift ship back to her namesake city in Australia.
