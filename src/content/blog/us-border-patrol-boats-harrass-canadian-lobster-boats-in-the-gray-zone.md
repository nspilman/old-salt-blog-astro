Machias Seal Island

This summer, Canadian lobstermen are complaining of being harassed by US Border Patrol agents in speedboats as they fish in waters claimed by both Canada and the US off Machias Seal Island. 

Since around 1733, the US and Canada have agreed to disagree over the ownership of Machias Seal Island, a treeless 20-acre island 10 miles off the coast of Maine, and the surrounding 277-square-mile waters known as the “gray zone.” A lighthouse built and maintained by Canadians on the island in 1832 is still operated by the Canadian Coast Guard. Ownership of the island has long been contested, but the [United States didn’t formally assert its claim](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2018/07/22/machias-seal-island-dispute) to the island until 1971.

A long-term compromise over fishing rights has been worked out in which each country imposes its fishing rules on its own vessels. Lobstering around Machias Seal Island attracts both US and Canadian lobster boats.  

While there has been tension between lobstermen in the past, the sudden arrival of the Border Patrol is something new. The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/the-trump-administration-is-ensnared-in-another-border-dispute--this-time-with-canada/2018/08/11/43bcc8aa-9800-11e8-818b-e9b7348cd87d_story.html?utm_term=.c686678be446) quotes Laurence Cook, a lobsterman and representative of the Fishermen’s Association from nearby Grand Manan Island. “I have no idea where they came from. We’ve never seen U.S. Border Patrol in the Gray Zone before.” 

The U.S. Border Patrol says it has stopped [21 Canadian vessels this year](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/lobster-fishermen-stopped-us-border-patrol-1.4735171) in the contested waters and has no intention of stopping. [Canada’s foreign ministry said in a statement](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/world/canada/canadian-border-patrol-fishing-boats.html) that “Canada’s sovereignty over Machias Seal Island and the surrounding waters is long-standing and has a strong foundation in international law.”

The conflict over the ownership of the island began with language in the Treaty of Paris of 1783 and a Nova Scotia land grant of 1621. The treaty, which ended the Revolutionary War, grants the United States rule over all islands within 20 leagues, or roughly 70 miles, of the American shore, except for islands that had been part of Nova Scotia. As Machias Seal Island is only 10 miles off the Maine coast, the island should be part of the US by the Treaty of Paris. On the other hand, the Canadians claim that a 1621 land-grant deeding the province to Sir William Alexander included the island, so their claim takes precedence. 

Whichever nation has the best claim, it is unclear why the US Border Patrol has chosen to intercept the Canadian lobstermen. The region is not a known smuggling path for illegal immigrants or narcotics. The current administration appears intent on inciting border conflicts whenever possible.
