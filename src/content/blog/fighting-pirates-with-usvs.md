![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ID38394_600.jpg)In August, we [posted about an experimental unmanned “roboship”](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/08/09/roboship-unveiled-in-virginia/) being developed as a coastal patrol craft.   Recently there have been proposals to use USVs (unmanned surface vehicles) to fight pirates.  USVs also known as autonomous surface vehicles (ASV), are any surface vessel operating without a crew.  At least so far, the idea is to use the USVs for surveillance and intelligence gathering.   While the USVs could be used for more aggressive activity, it is highly unlikely that the technology and control systems are sufficient to send armed unmanned vessels out to attack targets at sea, not to mention issues of international law.  The larger issue may have nothing to do with technology. Thus far the nations involved in anti-piracy activities have lacked the political will to prosecute the pirates.  As long as the navies of the world play catch and release with pirates, it seems unlikely that new technology will necessarily make much of a difference.  Thanks to Miroslav at [Antic.org](http://antic.org/) for passing the story along.
