California two-spot octopus

The octopus is a strange and amazing creature, the most intelligent and agile of all invertebrates. (In May, we posted [How Does an Octopus Keep Track of Eight Arms](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/05/how-does-an-octopus-keep-track-of-eight-arms/)?) Recently, scientists mapped the octopus genetic code and discovered that it is so strange that it could actually be termed “alien”.   As reported by the [Irish Examiner](http://www.irishexaminer.com/examviral/science-world/dont-freak-out-but-scientists-think-octopuses-might-be-aliens-after-dna-study-347880.html): *“The octopus appears to be utterly different from all other animals, even other molluscs, with its eight prehensile arms, its large brain and its clever problem-solving abilities,” said US researcher Dr Clifton Ragsdale, from the University of Chicago.* 

*“The late British zoologist Martin Wells said the octopus is an alien*. *In this sense, then, our paper describes the first sequenced genome from an alien.”*

The first whole cephalopod genome sequence shows a striking level of complexity with 33,000 protein-coding genes identified – more than in a human. Analysis of 12 different tissues revealed hundreds of octopus-specific genes found in no other animal, many of them highly active in structures such as the brain, skin and suckers. The scientists sequenced the genome of the [California two-spot octopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_two-spot_octopus) in a [study published in the journal Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v524/n7564/full/nature14668.html).
