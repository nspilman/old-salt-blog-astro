Flag of Curaçao

Today, 10/10/10 is proving popular as a day to be be married.   It is also apparently a good day for a divorce, or at east a reorganization. The Netherlands Antilles is being dissolved today.  The islands of Curaçao and Sint Maarten are becoming independent countries while the islands of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba will gain Dutch municipality status.   The Netherlands Antilles Ship Register will be transferred to the Curaçao Ship Register. This register is, and will remain, located in Willemstad , Curaçao, and the new country will assume all existing flag state responsibilities for this register.  All treaties, codes and legal responsibilities will be transferred to the new government.
