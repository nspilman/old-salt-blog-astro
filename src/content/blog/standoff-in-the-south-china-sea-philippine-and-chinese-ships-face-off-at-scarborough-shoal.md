BRP Gregorio del Pilar

The South China Sea is home to a myriad of competing claims for territory, fishing, oil and mineral rights by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan.  There is currently a stand-off between Chinese ships and the Philippine navy and coast guard vessels at [Scarborough Shoal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough_Shoal), located between the Macclesfield Bank and Luzon, Philippines in the South China  Sea.  Sovereignty  over Scarborough Shoal, a series of islands and an atoll,  is claimed by the Philippines, China and Taiwan.

As reported by the [Manila Standard](http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/2012/04/12/standoff-in-west-philippine-sea-shoal/):   *The current standoff began Sunday when a Navy surveillance plane sighted eight Chinese fishing vessels anchored in a lagoon at Scarborough, the Foreign Affairs Department said. That prompted the military to deploy its largest warship, the Hamilton class cutter BRP Gregorio del Pilar, which was recently acquired from the United States.*  
  
*On Tuesday, Filipino sailors from the warship boarded the Chinese vessels for an inspection, discovering large amounts of illegally collected coral, giant clams and live sharks inside the first boat, the department said in a statement.* 

*Two Chinese maritime surveillance ships, identified as Zhonggou Haijian 75 and Zhonggou Haijian 84, later approached and positioned themselves between the Gregorio del Pilar and the Chinese fishing vessels, “thus preventing the arrests of the erring Chinese fishermen,” the statement said.*

A third Chinese surveillance ship arrived on Thursday.

*Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said he will ask Chinese ambassador Ma Keqing to explain the arrival of a third Chinese surveillance ship at Scarborough, which he said lies well within his country’s territorial waters and off the northwestern Philippine province of Zambales. Despite the new concern, del Rosario said he would continue talks with Ma to resolve the impasse, possibly this week.*

*“We’re watching developments and at the same time we’re pursuing the diplomatic track,” Del Rosario said. “We’re moving forward but it’s still a work in progress.”*

*The Chinese Embassy said the fishing boats had taken shelter from a storm in the lagoon and accused Philippine troops of harassment. But Philippine authorities claimed the fishermen illegally entered their territory then collected giant clams, live sharks and other endangered marine species in violation of local laws.*

*The situation at the shoal remained relatively calm, although the Philippine military spotted a suspected Chinese surveillance aircraft which briefly flew over the shoal Wednesday, Pama said.*

*The United States said it was concerned by the increased tensions in the South China Sea. “We urge all parties to exercise full restraint and seek a diplomatic resolution,” a State Department spokesperson said on customary condition of anonymity.*
