Earlier in the month we posted about [New York harbor’s “graveyard of ships”](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/02/new-yorks-graveyard-of-ships-on-tv-and-radio/).  Yesterday the [Daily Telegraph](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw-act/what-secrets-lie-in-sydneys-ship-cemetery/story-e6freuzi-1225954057388) featured an interesting article about Sydney’s ship cemetery – an abandoned wrecking yard in Homebush Bay where several wooden barges and at least five ships slowly rot or rust away.

*In 1966 the old Maritime Services Board leased part of the bay to firms to moor vessels before they were brought up a slipway and torn apart.*

*A decade later, as the Harbour’s maritime industry declined, the yard was closed. Boats unable to be towed out to sea and scuttled were left to rot.*

*Among the vessels that now double as giant steel pots for the creeping mangroves include the HMAS Karangi, a boom defence vessel that was based in Darwin during part of WWII and survived the Japanese attacks on the city in 1942 and 1943.*

*Adjacent is the SS Heroic, a steel steam tug commandeered by the British Navy in WWI which helped rescue the freighter Allara after it was torpedoed off Sydney in WWII.*

*On the other side of the bay is the largest wreck, the 70m Sydney to Newcastle collier the Ayrfield, which was also commandeered during WWII.*

*“A lot of people would not realise the importance of the wrecking yards,” Planning Department senior heritage officer Tim Smith said.*
