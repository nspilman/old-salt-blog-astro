![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1101411222_400.jpg)We seem to need to put a face to our enemies. On the [cover of Time Magazine of December 22, 1941](http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19411222,00.html), the face of the enemy was [Admiral Yamamoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto), labeled as “Japan’s Aggressor.” The image of the admiral is a scowling caricature in yellow, looking off to one side, personifying an image of Oriental duplicity and betrayal. In the decades following the war, historians have been far more charitable to Isoroku Yamamoto, casting him as a reluctant warrior who understood and predicted Japan’s defeat even while personally planning the attack on Pear Harbor. Ian Toll’s [A Reluctant Enemy](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/opinion/a-reluctant-enemy.html?hp) in today’s New York Times makes this case. I wonder whether this assessment of Yamamoto is not, at times, almost as a much a caricature as the Time magazine cover of 1941.  
  
Perhaps that suggestion is unfair to [Ian Toll](http://www.amazon.com/Pacific-Crucible-War-Sea-1941-1942/dp/0393068137/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1323287655&sr=1-1), who is a fine historian. His essay in today’s New York Times does make a key point which is too often ignored. Toll writes ” *Pearl Harbor aside, Yamamoto was not a great admiral. His strategic blunders were numerous and egregious, and were criticized even by his own subordinate officers*.”

The attack at Pearl Harbor was the only the first part of Yamamoto’s strategy. The second part was to defeat the remaining American fleet in a “decisive battle” to further cripple American naval power and force a capitulation in the Pacific. Here Yamamoto failed completely. The “decisive battle” was intended to be what we now call the Battle of Midway, an American victory. Yamamoto’s attempt to strike back with his remaining forces were then stymied by the American invasion of Guadalcanal. As Toll writes “*Yamamoto was also directly responsible for Japan’s cataclysmic defeat at the Battle of Midway, and for the costly failure of his four-month campaign to recapture the island of Guadalcanal*.”

Fortunately for the Americans, Yamamoto turned out to be a better politician and bureaucrat than admiral. Ironically one of Yamamoto’s innovations before the war was the development of long range land-based naval aviation, particularly the Mitsubishi G3M and G4M medium bombers. These planes had a longer range than their fighter escorts and were lightly constructed. With full loads of fuel they were vulnerable to enemy fire which led Allied fighter pilots to nickname the G4M “the Flying Cigarette Lighter.” Yamamoto would eventually die in one of these aircraft. On April 18th, 1943, Yamamoto was traveling in a G4M fast transport plane when it was ambushed by American P-38 Lightning fighters and shot down.

Much is made of Yamamoto’s prediction that Japan lacked the resources to defeat the United States in a protracted war. Nevertheless, this is not to say that he completely opposed going to war with the United States. Yamamoto did indeed threaten to resign just prior to the start of the war, but it was not over his opposition to the war itself. He threatened to resign if he was not allowed to go forward with his attack on Pearl Harbor. While in many respects, Yamamoto was a “reluctant enemy,” perhaps, he was not quite reluctant enough. Whatever his degrees of reluctance, he also, fortunately, wasn’t a particularly good admiral.
