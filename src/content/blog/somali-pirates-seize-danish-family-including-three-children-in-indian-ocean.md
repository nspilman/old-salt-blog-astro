*The Danish Foreign Ministry said the ship sent a distress signal on Thursday. On board was a Danish couple, their three children – aged 12-16 – and two adult crew members, also Danes.*  
  
*“It has now been confirmed that the sailboat was hijacked by pirates in the Indian Ocean,” the ministry said in a statement.*

*Two days before the Danish sailboat sent the distress signal, four Americans were killed by Somali pirates in a hostage standoff. They were the first Americans slain by Somali pirates since a wave of attacks began six years ago.*

*Earlier Monday, the European Union Naval Force said Somali pirates hijacked a Greek-owned cargo vessel with 23 crew on board.*

*The MV Dover was seized Monday in the north Arabian sea, 260 miles (420 kilometers) northeast of the Omani port of Salalah, the naval force said. The MV Dover was on its way to Yemen from Pakistan when it was attacked.*

We recently [posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/18/losing-the-war-on-piracy-a-lack-of-political-will/) about the Danish warship, *[Esbern Snare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMS_Esbern_Snare_\(L17\)),* which captured a hijacked fishing vessel and freed two Yemeni hostages.  The 16 pirates aboard the ship were released due to a lack of evidence.  See: [Losing the War on Piracy – A Lack of Political Will](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/18/losing-the-war-on-piracy-a-lack-of-political-will/)
