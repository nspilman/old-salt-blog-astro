On June 12,1943 in 600 feet of water, the submarine USS *R12* sank in 15 seconds in 600 feet of water, taking 42 of her crew with her to the bottom.  Recently, a team led by Tim Taylor on the “*RV Tiburon*”  has located and documented the wreck of the submarine.

*She sank nearly 70 years ago taking 42 US servicemen to their deaths off the coast of the Florida Keys, USA. The reason for her loss remains unknown.*

*R-12 began its career as a World War I era sub that was re-commissioned for service in World War II. At the time of the sinking R-12 was engaged in war time patrol operations near Key West. Only two officers and 3 enlisted men survived the disaster that claimed 42 lives.*

*In making the discovery, the team deployed a state-of-the-art autonomous underwater robot which collected first ever imagery of the remains of R-12. They are collaborating and sharing their findings with the US Navy.*
