![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gcapegmr.jpg)I am very pleased and grateful that my new novel, [*Evening Gray Morning Red,*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075NY1SRL/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1505735970&sr=1-1&keywords=spilman+evening+gray) has been selected to be on [gCaptain](https://gcaptain.com/)‘s list of the [Best Nautical Books Of 2017](https://gcaptain.com/gcaptain-best-books-2017/).   About the novel:

In [*Evening Gray Morning Red*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075NY1SRL/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1505735970&sr=1-1&keywords=spilman+evening+gray) a young American sailor must escape his past and the clutches of the Royal Navy, in the turbulent years just before the American Revolutionary War.

In the spring of 1768, Thom Larkin, a 17-year-old sailor newly arrived in Boston, is caught by a Royal Navy press gang and dragged off to HMS *Romney*, where he runs afoul of the cruel and corrupt Lieutenant Dudingston. Years later, after escaping the *Romney*, Thom again crosses paths with his old foe, now in command HMS *Gaspee*, cruising in Narragansett Bay. Thom Larkin must face the guns of the Royal Navy, with only his wits, an unarmed packet boat, and a sandbar.
