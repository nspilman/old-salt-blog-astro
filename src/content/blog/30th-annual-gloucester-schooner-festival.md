The schooners start arriving in Gloucester, MA tomorrow for the [30th Annual Gloucester Schooner Festival](http://gloucesterschoonerfestival.net/).  [Twenty three schooners](http://gloucesterschoonerfestival.net/?page_id=44) are participating this year. The US Coast Guard barque [*Eagle*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Eagle_\(WIX-327\)), while definitely not a schooner, will also be visiting. On Saturday, the schooners will be at the dock for visitors, while onshore, the town will be celebrating [Maritime Gloucester Heritage Day](http://maritimegloucester.org/visit/event.php?s=2014-08-30-celebrate-maritime-heritage-day-at-maritime-gloucester). Sunday begins with a Parade of Sail followed by the Mayor’s race for the [Esperanto Cup](http://gloucesterschoonerfestival.net/?page_id=35).  [Click here](http://gloucesterschoonerfestival.net/?p=655) for information on reserving a place aboard one of the schooners during the Parade of Sail.
