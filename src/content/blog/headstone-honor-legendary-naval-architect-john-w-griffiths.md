![griffiths](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/griffiths.jpg)On Saturday, July 23rd, the [National Maritime Historical Society](http://www.seahistory.org/) will unveil a headstone at the previously unmarked grave of legendary naval architect [John W. Griffiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Griffiths). The ceremony will take place in Queens at the [Linden Hill United Methodist Cemetery](http://lindenhillumcemeteryny.com/) at 10:30 am.

John W. Griffiths was born in New York City in 1809 and died in 1882. He was one of the greatest of all American naval architects and a yet he died largely forgotten. Griffiths was a pioneer in both sail and steam, a designer, a shipbuilder, a hydrodynamicist, a writer and an editor. The historian William Brown Meloney wrote of Griffiths, “Ocean conqueror by sail and by steam, he sleeps as he died, unhonored and unsung — forgotten by a heedless people . . . ”  With the unveiling of the new headstone, he will be at least somewhat less forgotten.

John Griffiths was the designer of [*Rainbow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_\(clipper\)), the first extreme clipper built in 1845 for the China trade. He also designed the clippers [*Sea Witch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Witch_\(clipper\)) of 1846 and [*Memnon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memnon_\(clipper\)) of 1848.  In his day, his designs were considered to be radical and yet each set records for speed and were known for outrunning steamships. The *Sea Witch* made a record-setting run from Hong Kong to New York in 77 days, a record still unbroken by a monohull under sail.

Griffiths also designed and steamships, including the [USS *Pawnee*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Pawnee_\(1859\)), a naval gunboat propelled by twin screws, and the shallow draft merchant ship SS *North Carolina*. He also edited the magazine *American Ship* and was the author of *The Ship-builder’s Manual and Nautical Referee* and *The Progressive Ship Builder*.  Griffiths also held numerous patents for shipbuilding and steam engine designs.
