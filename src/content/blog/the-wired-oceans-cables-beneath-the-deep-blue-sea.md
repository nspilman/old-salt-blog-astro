For something so relatively new, we take the internet very much for granted.  The first graphical web browser is less than 20 years old.  Nevertheless, the internet seems ubiquitous in most of our lives.  But on a world that is over 70% ocean, how do we communicate from one continent to another?  Primarily, by sub-sea cable. [TeleGeography](http://www.telegeography.com/telecom-resources/telegeography-infographics/submarine-cable-map/) has put together a map of the submarine cables that link us together on-line.

What I find interesting is that while the internet may be relatively new, undersea cable isn’t.  The first successful transatlantic cable was laid by the *[SS Great Eastern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Great_Eastern)* in 1866.  By the early 1870s undersea cables were run to Saudi Arabia, India, and Australia.  By 1902, the US mainland was linked by undersea cable to Hawaii, Hawaii, Guam, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji. Antarctica is the only continent not yet linked by a submarine telecommunications cables.  To he right is a map of undersea telegraph cables from 1901.
