![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/10/urger.jpg)The New York State Canal Corporation’s website still refers to the tug *Urger* as the “[flagship](http://www.canals.ny.gov/history/tugurger.html)” of the Erie Canal. The *Urger* served more than 60 years hauling machinery, dredges, and scows on the Erie and Champlain Canals until she was retired from service in the 1980s. Now, 117-year-old tug, which has served as a floating classroom for the canal since 1991, is [earmarked to become a display at a Thruway rest stop.](https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Pause-plans-to-scuttle-historic-boats-Canal-13239305.php) 

In addition to the Canal Corporation and New York State Power Authority’s plan to beach the *Urger* at the Exit 28 rest stop in Montgomery County, they have already sunk already sunk seven canal vessels off the coast of Long Island to make artificial reefs and have another six vessels under review.

Jay DiLorenzo, president of the Preservation League of New York State points out that three of the seven boats were eligible for inclusion in the National Register. “There needs to be a pause before anything else happens,” DiLorenzo argues.

DiLorenzo said that the proposed plan was short-sighted, since the Urger has been a highly visible promotion for the canal system, and has been visited by tens of thousands of people during its career. A plan to “retreat and retrench” might reduce the public support that the canals rely on for continued state funding, he said.

Last month, the preservation league launched an online petition drive to save the *Urger* that has drawn hundreds of signatures. It can be found online at [https://www.preservenys.org/save-the-urger.html](https://www.preservenys.org/save-the-urger.html)
