![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2009/08/prinswillemburned.jpg)The *Prins Willem*, the replica Dutch East Indiaman [destroyed by fire](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/07/voc-flagship-replica-prins-willem-destroyed-by-fire) a few days ago, was an unusual ship.  She was built in 1985 in in Friesland in 1985 as an exhibit at the [Nagasaki Holland Village](http://travel.webshots.com/album/65733012iQshon) open-air museum in Japan. The [Japanese theme park was closed](http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20011012a3.html) and the Prince Willem returned to the Netherlands in 2003 and had been moored at Den Helder.  (Interestingly enough, at least to me, the [Nagasaki Holland Village](http://travel.webshots.com/album/65733012iQshon) park was replaced by a newer and larger Dutch based theme park [Huis Ten Bosch](http://english.huistenbosch.co.jp/index.html) also in Nagasaki.)  
  
The ship has been operated as tourist attraction by [Libéma](http://www.libema.nl/), a diversified Dutch entertainment company. News reports suggest that [Libéma](http://www.libema.nl/) plans on rebuilding the ship.  The ship was built using a steel frame which appears to have survived the fire.

The *Prins Willem* replica was not universally beloved.  Critics had complained that she was a “Disney” replica,  not sufficiently historically accurate with too much freeboard, oddly arranged cabins and no hold to speak of (an odd feature for a replica of the largest merchant-man of her time.)   One observer referred to her as a “Disneyfied steel butterbox.”

To be fair, the ship was designed and built to be an exhibit at a theme park, so historical accuracy may not have been the first consideration.  Even the replica of the [*HMS Bounty*](http://www.tallshipbounty.org/) built for the move, [Mutiny on the Bounty](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056264/), was built to Admiralty plans of the ship, yet was scaled up by roughly 30% to allow for movie cameras to fit below decks.  Nevertheless the *Prins Willem* does raise an interesting question as to what liberties modern designers should take when designing and building a “replica” ship. I’m not sure that the question has an easy or even a single answer
