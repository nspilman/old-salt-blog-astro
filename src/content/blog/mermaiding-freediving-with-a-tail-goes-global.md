![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/chinesemermaiding.jpg)The title of an article in CNN was intriguing — [Why so many people in China are becoming mermaids.](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-mermaid-diving-cmd/index.html) The article featured a recent event described as the “[largest underwater mermaid show](https://www.cnn.com/videos/travel/2021/04/30/china-mermaid-show-guinness-world-record-orig-bdk.cnn)” that set a Guinness World Record at the Ambassador Lagoon inside China’s Atlantis Sanya resort on the island of Hainan.

Apparently, mermaid diving, also known as mermaiding, has become very popular in China. Akin to freediving, the would-be mermaids don’t wear a tank or use any external aids except for their mermaid tail. While the name may imply females, men are also joining in the fun.

Mermaiding’s popularity is not limited to China, however. Mermaid diving has been spreading across the globe for many years now as professionals put on performances as mermaids. More recently, mermaiding has become available to non-professionals via mermaid classes and retreats. 

Anyone can now become a mermaid.  Many dive shops are offering mermaid certifications.  Both the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) and Scuba Schools International (SSI) offer a range of courses. PADI announced in December the launch of the [new PADI Mermaid program](https://pros-blog.padi.com/2020/12/16/introducing-the-new-padi-mermaid-program/) – designed to provide water-enthusiasts an additional outlet for exploring their underwater passion. They now offer four levels of courses from “Discover the Mermaid Experience” to “Advanced Mermaid.” 

SSI also offers certification courses in [advanced mermaid education](https://www.divessi.com/en/advanced-training/mermaid) including “Ocean Mermaid” and “Model Mermaid.”

Beyond coursework, there are also “[mermaid retreats](https://mermaidkat.com/category/mermaid-week/)” in exotic locales around the world. And, of course, there are outlets for mermaid accouterment ranging from simple [monofins](https://aquamermaid.com/blogs/news/mermaid-monofin-guide) to [elaborate technicolor tails](https://www.mermaidtailfactory.com/). Not quite ready to take the plunge and buy your own gear? Aqua Mermaid even offers [tail rentals](https://aquamermaid.com/pages/mermaid-tail-rental).
