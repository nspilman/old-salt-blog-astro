![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/digitalbillboard.jpg)If you happen to have been on the Hudson or East River waterfront in Manhattan recently, there is a good chance that you might have seen a [60′ illuminated digital billboard](http://gothamist.com/2019/01/02/ad_barge_nyc_waterfront.php) on a barge passing by close to shore. The billboard features advertising pitching everything from beer to movies to helicopter rides. The company which operates the barge, Ballyhoo Media, considers it to be “the future of digital billboard advertising.” Many New Yorkers consider it to be a nuisance and an eyesore. The City of New York considers the billboard barge to be [illegal and has filed a lawsuit](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-floating-billboards-lawsuit-20190327-dwinhfizabesvcyc36ccpwutnm-story.html) to shut it down.

The [suit alleges that the LED-illuminated seafaring signs](https://nypost.com/2019/03/27/nyc-sues-advertising-firm-over-floating-billboards/) along the Hudson and East rivers create a “public nuisance” that distract motorists and spoil the view for sightseers — and also are breaking local zoning laws.

“Our waterways aren’t Times Square. These floating eye-sores have no place on them,” said de Blasio in a statement about the suit. “Ballyhoo is operating in direct violation of the law, and we are filing this suit to put a stop to it.”

Complaints have been filed against the barge operators since it began cruising the city’s waterways in October. The billboards appear to be in clear violation of  [local zoning rules](https://zr.planning.nyc.gov/article-iii/chapter-2/32-663)—”no moving or stationary advertising sign shall be displayed on a vessel plying waterways adjacent to Commercial Districts and within view from an arterial highway.” Under [state navigation law](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/NAV/46-A), the jurisdiction of vessels operating within 1,500 feet of the shoreline would fall to the local legislative body.
