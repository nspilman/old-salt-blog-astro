We recently [posted about the retired oyster dredging schooners](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/12/a-bad-night-for-the-oyster-schooner-ada-c-lore-cousin-to-a-j-meerwald/) *A.J. Meerwald*  and the *Ada C. Lore*.  Here is a wonderful short video featuring an interview with Arthur “Daddy Art” Daniels, a 93 year old skipjack captain, who is still dredging oysters under sail in the Chesapeake Bay on his skipjack, *City of Crisfield*.  He is the oldest captain still working the Chesapeake. There are only a handful of skipjacks that are actively still working on the bay.  Thanks to Raymond Faulkner for pointing the video out on Facebook.
