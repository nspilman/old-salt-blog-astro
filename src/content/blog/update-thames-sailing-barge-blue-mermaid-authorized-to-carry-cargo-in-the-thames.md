![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bluemermaid.jpg)In 2019, we posted about *[Blue Mermaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mermaid)*, the first [sailing barge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_sailing_barge) built for trade in Britain since 1930. Recently, the [Maritime and Coastguard Agency has granted permission](https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/sailing-ship-authorised-for-cargo-deliveries-in-the-thames-60609/?fbclid=IwAR3fMfg5XF9vdOknfOWzDqwWPiTxVD6vhAJ90Smcnie0zDRPVy_2rh4AkeU) to the [Sea-Change Sailing Trust](https://seachangesailingtrust.org.uk/), which owns the *Blue Mermaid,* for the barge to carry cargoes of up to 110 tonnes, between Lowestoft and Sandwich – and up the Thames. *Blue Mermaid* is also the first UK-registered sailing vessel to be authorized as a commercial cargo carrier since the 1970s.

The sailing ship trust, which provides training and education for young people and vulnerable adults is working with Brightlingsea-based Essex Cement to carry cargo within its authorized range.

Sea-Change’s executive officer, Richard Titchener, said: “If you need cement anywhere on the Thames (or anywhere between Lowestoft and Sandwich), please get in touch. You will not only cut carbon emissions, but also be helping us in our work to train and develop young people in need.”

In 2022, a total of 200 mainly young or vulnerable people took to the water aboard the Blue Mermaid with the Trust. The last commercial cargo to be carried by a UK-registered sailing vessel was 100 tonnes of cattle cake, which set sail from Tilbury to Ipswich aboard the Cambria in 1970.

*Blue Mermaid* is 87 feet (27 m) long and has a hold that can carry 84 palettes or 150 short tons (140 t) of loose cargo. She is a replica of an older vessel of the same name, built in 1930 but sunk by enemy action during World war II.
