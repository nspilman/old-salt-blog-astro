*The solar system’s innermost planets are about to put on a beautiful show.*

*This week, Mercury is emerging from the glare of the sun and making a beeline for Venus. By week’s end, the two planets will be just 3o apart, an eye-catching pair in the deep-blue twilight of sunset.*

*The best nights to look are April 3rd and 4th. Go outside at the end of the day and face west. Venus pops out of the twilight first, so bright it actually shines through thin clouds. Mercury follows, just below and to the right: [sky map](http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2010/images/sunsetplanets/skymap_north_03apr10.gif).*

*Venus is an old friend to most sky watchers; Mercury, less so. The first planet from the sun spends most of its time wrapped in painful sunlight. Seeing it so easily, and in the beautiful company of Venus no less, is a rare treat indeed. The next apparition this good won’t come until Nov. 2011.*
