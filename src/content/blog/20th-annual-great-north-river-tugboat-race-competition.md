![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/08/banner-2-start-line-1.gif)The [20th Annual Great North River Tugboat Race and Competition](http://workingharbor.com/tugrace_home.html) will be held again this year on the Hudson River at Pier 84 (off W44th Street) in Manhattan.  The festivities begin with a Parade of Tugs at 10:00 am with the tug boat race, from the 79th Street Boat Basin to Pier 84, starting at 10:30. Good views of the race are available from the dock. A special [Circle Line Spectator Boat](http://www.nycharities.org/events/EventLevels.aspx?ETID=5276) also provides a great view of the race and the parade of tugs.  Following the race, there will be line throwing competitions and  nose-to-nose pushing competitions between the tugs.  If you are anywhere near New York harbor on Sunday, it is worth stopping by. The event is sponsored by the [Working Harbor Committee](http://workingharbor.com/).
