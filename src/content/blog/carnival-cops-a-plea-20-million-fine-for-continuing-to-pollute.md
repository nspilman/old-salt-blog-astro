![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/04/carnivalcorp1.jpg)In April, we posted, [Judge Threatens to Block Carnival Cruise Ships from Docking in US Ports](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/04/judge-threatens-to-block-carnival-cruise-ships-from-docking-in-us-ports/), in which U.S. District Judge Patricia Seitz considered temporarily blocking the largest cruise corporation in the world from docking its ships at ports in the United States as punishment for a possible probation violation of a previous pollution settlement.

In 2016, Princess Cruise Lines, a Carnival subsidiary, agreed to pay a $40 million fine for illegally dumping and attempting the cover up the dumping of oil-contaminated waste into the sea. Part of the deal was an agreement that Carnival, Princess and associated cruise lines would, figuratively and literally, clean up their act. The cruise giant was put on five years’ probation.

In a settlement announced on Monday, Carnival agreed to pay an additional $20 million, after admitted to failing to live up to the terms of the probation. A whistleblower reported the dumping of grey water and plastics, falsifying records, and hiding violations from Federal inspectors.

The agreement also would set Sept. 13 and Oct. 9 deadlines to create an improved compliance plan and make other changes, subject to fines of $1 million per day if those deadlines are not met.

Other proposed changes include a reduction by Carnival in the use of single-use plastic items across its entire fleet and creation of “tiger teams” meant to make improvements in the ships’ food and beverage systems and how waste is handled at sea.
