![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/windcoop.jpg)In February, we [posted about the world’s first commercial sailing ro/ro](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2025/02/neoliner-origin-worlds-first-commercial-sailing-ro-ro-launched-in-turkey/), the [*Neoliner Origin*](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-01-world-longest-cargo-ship-turkey.html). Launched by Turkish shipyard [RMK Marine](https://www.rmkmarine.com.tr/en/ongoing-projects/), the ship is expected to enter service in mid-2025.

This week, it was announced that [Windcoop](https://www.wind.coop/en/), a French maritime cooperative based in Lorient, has placed an order with RMK Marine for the world’s first wind-powered container ship. The wind-powered open hatch box ship will operate between Madagascar and France. Construction is said to commence in 2026, while the ship is expected to undergo trials, delivery, and commissioning in May 2027.

The 91.3-meter-long ship will have a  210 TEU capacity, including 40 reefer plugs for refrigerated cargo. The three wing sails, designed by [Computer Wingsails](https://computedwingsail.com/en/) (CWS), are each 350 square meters for a total sail area of 1,050 square meters. The ship is projected to have an average speed of 9 knots under sail.

“After four years of development, we are finally taking decisive steps toward realizing what was once considered an audacious dream,” said Matthieu Brunet, Chairman of Windcoop. The effort was started in 2022. Based in Lorient, France, Windcoop was created through the collaboration of Zéphyr & Borée, Enercoop and Arcadie.

[Maritime Executive](https://maritime-executive.com/article/construction-order-placed-for-world-s-first-sail-powered-containership) reports that the total construction cost is set at €28.5 million ($31.5 million). Windcoop reports it has secured financing of €28.5 million structured by Crédit Maritime Grand Ouest – Banque Populaire, with a counter-guarantee from Bpifrance. The financing includes €6.8 million ($7.5 million) raised through the cooperative. This involved 1,600 citizens, committed shippers (Arcadie, Valrhona, Prova, Lobodis, Ethicable, Cafés Richard, Demad, Arawak), and institutional investors (La Nef, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, SIDI, Mer Invest, Inddigo, Bretagne Capital Solidaire). It is the first cargo ship of this size to include cooperative funding.
