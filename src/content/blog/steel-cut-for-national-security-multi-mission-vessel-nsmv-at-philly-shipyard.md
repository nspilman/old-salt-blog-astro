![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/12/nsmv.jpg)Today, steel was cut for the first [National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV)](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/newsroom/press-releases/national-security-multi-mission-vessel-achieves-first-construction) at [Philly Shipyard, Inc.](http://www.phillyshipyard.com/) The NSMV is designed to be a state-of-the-art training vessel for America’s state maritime academies. The ship will also be available to support humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions. 

In May 2019, MARAD awarded [TOTE Services](http://www.toteservices.com/), LLC, a company involved in ship management, marine operations, and vessel services, a contract to be the Vessel Construction Manager (VCM) for the NSMV program. In April 2020, TOTE Services awarded Philly Shipyard, Inc. a contract to construct up to five NSMVs.

In addition to being a state-of-the-art training ship, each NSMV will feature modern hospital facilities, a helicopter pad, and the ability to accommodate up to 1,000 people in times of humanitarian need. The NSMV will also provide needed roll-on/roll-off and container storage capacity for use during disaster relief missions.

TOTE Services has ordered the first two NSMVs and the President’s budget request for Fiscal Year 2021 includes sufficient funding for TOTE Services to order the third ship. Construction of the first two NSMVs will replace training ships at SUNY Maritime Academy and Massachusetts Maritime Academy, which are both more than 50 years old.
