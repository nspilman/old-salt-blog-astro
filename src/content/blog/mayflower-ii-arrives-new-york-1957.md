Yesterday, we [posted about the renewal and reconstruction](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/11/hauling-the-mayflower-ii-at-mystic-seaport/) of the [Mayflower II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower_II) at [Mystic Seaport Museum](http://www.mysticseaport.org/category/mayflower-ii-restoration/). Here is a short video of the ship in 1957 arriving in New York on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic. I love the juxtaposition of the 17th century ship and the blimp and the helicopters flying above it.
