![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/bpvcapehorn.jpg)The maxi-trimaran *[Banque Populaire V](http://www.voile.banquepopulaire.fr/Maxi-Trimaran-Banque-Populaire-V/accueil.html)* has now rounded all three of the major capes; Cape of Good Hope, Cape Leeuwin and now Cape Horn; in its quest to set the record for the fastest non-stop sail around the world. This morning *Banque Populaire V* rounded Cape Horn traveling at a speed of close to 30 knots. The maxi-tri rounded the Horn 30 days and 22 hours after departing from France. To claim the [Jules Verne Trophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_Trophy), the *Banque Populaire V* team will have to arrive back at the starting line no later than Monday, January 9th. The current record was set by the trimaran *[Groupma 3](http://yachtpals.com/groupama3)* at 48 days 7 hours 44 minutes 52 seconds. Banque Populaire V currently has roughly 30 hour lead over *Groupma 3*‘s time on rounding the Horn. The long leg north up the South Atlantic and across the doldrums will determine if *Banque Populaire V* succeeds in setting anew record.

[FLASH: The Maxi Banque Populaire has passed Cape Horn!](http://www.voile.banquepopulaire.fr/Maxi-Trimaran-Banque-Populaire-V/FLASH-Le-Maxi-Banque-Populaire-a-passe-le-Cap-Horn-6607.html )
