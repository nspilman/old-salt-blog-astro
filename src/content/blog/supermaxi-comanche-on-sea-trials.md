I have mixed feeling about modern supermaxi monohulls. They are complicated, expensive sailing wedges — pointy in the bow and broad and flat on the stern.  But they are really fast, and watching [Jim Clark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Clark)‘s new 100’ carbon fiber speed-demon [*Comanche*](http://www.sail-world.com/USA/New-supermaxi-Comanche-sails-with-Ken-Read-ahead-of-Hobart-race/127744) is impressive. Built by [Hodgdon](http://www.hodgdonyachts.com/) of Boothbay, Maine and skippered by [Ken Reid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Read_\(sailor\)), the supermaxi recently completed sea trials off Newport Rhode Island, where she reportedly reached speeds of 30 knots.  She is now on her way to Charlestown, SC where she will be loaded on a ship to be carried to Sydney, Australia to compete in the 70th [Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race](http://www.rolexsydneyhobart.com/) in December.
