If you are near New York harbor this Sunday, swing by Manhattan’s Pier 84 (at W. 44th St.) on the Hudson River to catch the [26th Annual Great North River Tugboat Race and Competition](https://www.nycharities.org/Events/EventLevels.aspx?etid=10703), sponsored by the Working Harbor Committee. More than 15 tugboats are expected to participate. The festivities begin with a Parade of Tugs, near Pier 84, followed by a race, which runs from W. 70th St to Pier 84.  Following the race, there will be nose-to-nose tug pushing contests, and a line-throwing competition by tugboat crew members. There will also be a Popeye-inspired spinach-eating contest, a tattoo tournament, and an awards ceremony.

There are two ways to see the race — watch from around Pier 84, or watch the race, up close and personal from a Circle Line Spectator Boat. Pick up the Spectator Boat from Pier 83, West 43rd Street and Hudson River Park. Boarding begins at 10:15am. The trip lasts will be onboard from 10:30am to 12:30pm. Tickets are $25 for adults, $20 for seniors, and $12 for children 3-12. [Click here to buy tickets or to learn more.](https://www.nycharities.org/Events/EventLevels.aspx?etid=10703)
