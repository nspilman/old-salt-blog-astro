Laser scanning has been used to create a 3D map of HMS Victory, Nelson’s flagship in his victory at Trafalgar. Using 850 separate scans, scientists have collected 90 billion measurements on the 230 foot long ship at her drydock in Portsmouth. The 3D model documents the ship’s condition and is being used in the ongoing restoration.
