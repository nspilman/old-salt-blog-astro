![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/grundner.jpg)There aren’t many publishers with a special interest in nautical fiction.  Tom Grundner, the owner of [Fireship Press](http://www.fireshippress.com/), who died suddenly on September 11th, was one.  I never had the chance to meet him in person, but I genuinely liked the man I knew only through emails and over the internet.  In addition to serving as Senior Editor of Fireship, he was also the author of the Sir Sidney Smith Nautical Adventure Series. (See our review of his book, *[The Temple](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/10/12/the-temple-third-book-in-the-sir-sidney-smith-series-by-tom-grundner/)*.)  Prior to entering publishing, he had an impressive and varied career in academia and business.  For a complete obituary of this remarkable man, see David Haye’s [Obituary: Tom Grundner (1945-2011)](http://www.historicnavalfiction.com/index.php/general-hnf-info/astrodenes-blog/2432-obituary-tom-grundner-1945-2011).   See also [An Interview with Tom Grundner](http://www.historicnavalfiction.com/index.php/general-hnf-info/astrodenes-blog/2255-an-interview-with-tom-grundner-).
