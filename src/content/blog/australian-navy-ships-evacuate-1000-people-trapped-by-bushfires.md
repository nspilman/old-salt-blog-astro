The Australian Navy landing ship [HMAS *Choules*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Choules), supported by the training ship, [MV *Sycamore*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Sycamore), evacuated 1,000 tourists and residents stranded by bushfires in Mallacoota, Australia.

[ABC News Australia](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-03/navy-starts-bushfires-evacuations--in-mallacoota/11838424) reports that about 4,000 people, including some 3,000 tourists, have been stranded in the town since they were forced to shelter on the foreshore as the fire approached on New Year’s Eve. Roads in and out of the isolated town, in Victoria’s far east, have been blocked by the still-burning blaze and could take weeks to clear.

The most vulnerable in the town are being evacuated by helicopter. The process of loading the vessels took several hours, and the journey from Mallacoota to Hastings, on Western Port, should take a further 17 hours.
