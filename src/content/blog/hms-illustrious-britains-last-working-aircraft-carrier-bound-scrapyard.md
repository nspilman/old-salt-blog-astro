[![hmsillustrious](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hmsillustrious.jpg)HMS *Illustrious*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Illustrious_\(R06\)), the [UK’s only working aircraft carrier](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/06/hms-illustrious-britains-last-working-aircraft-carrier-to-be-sol/) and the last surviving ship from the Falklands War is to be scrapped.  The 689 ft-long 22,000-tonne [Invincible-class aircraft carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invincible-class_aircraft_carrier) traveled close to one million sea miles in her 32-year career with the Royal Navy, serving in conflicts from the Falklands to Bosnia and Iraq. She was decommissioned in 2014. Proposals to turn the ship into a floating museum or attraction space all fell through.  Bids are reportedly being solicited to scrap the ship.

Great Britain has two new aircraft carriers under construction. The first, [HMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth-class_aircraft_carrier) *[Queen Elizabeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth-class_aircraft_carrier),*  is due to be commissioned in 2017 with initial operations in 2020.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](https://www.alaricbond.com/) for contributing to this post.
