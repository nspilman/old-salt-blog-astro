Anak Krakatau

On Saturday, a [tsunami in Indonesia’s Sunda Strait](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46663158) killed at least 222 and injured 843. The huge wave hit without warning at night destroying hundreds of homes and buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees. Officials say more than 160 people were killed in Pandeglang – a popular tourist district on Java known for its beaches and national park. The main road into Pandeglang is reported to be badly damaged, making it difficult for rescuers to reach the area. In South Lampung on Sumatra, 48 were reported dead. Deaths were reported in Serang district and Tanggamus, also on Sumatra. Officials fear the death toll could rise further.

The tsunami is thought have been caused by an underwater landslide following a recent eruption of the volcano [Anak Krakatau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakatoa#Anak_Krakatau), which has been active since June. 

This year has been particularly brutal and tragic in Indoneisa, which is located on the so-called volcanic “[Ring of Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire).” In July and August, a series of earthquakes flattened parts of the tourist island of Lombok, and a double earthquake and tsunami killed more than 2,000 people on Sulawesi island in September.

The volcano believed to cause the most recent tsunami is Arak Krakatau. In Indonesian, Arak means “child.” The “Child of Krakatau” grew from the site of the original volcano named [Krakatau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa#Global_climate), which exploded catastrophically in 1883. The eruption and tsunamis caused the deaths of at least 36,000. Volcanic ash from Krakatau caused average Northern Hemisphere summer [temperatures to fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_winter "Volcanic winter") by as much as 1.2 °C. It took five years for temperatures to return to normal.
