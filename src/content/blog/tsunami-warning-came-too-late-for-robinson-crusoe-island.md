Selkirk would be the model for Defoe’s [Robinson Crusoe](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593080115?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593080115) and Mas a Tierra would become known as Robinson Crusoe Island.  Tragically, the island has been devastated by a tsunami following the recent earthquake.  The village of Juan Bautista was largely destroyed and nine people were killed by a wall of water reported to up to 5 meters high.

*Upon hearing the sirens, some of the 629 residents of the village of Juan Bautista on Robinson Crusoe Island ran to the hills with no time for salvage.*

*A wall of water – possibly nearly 5 metres high – ravaged everything in its way. Within a few minutes, the scene of the adventures of Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk – marooned on the island from 1704 to 1708, and immortalized in Daniel Defoe’s novel Robinson Crusoe – had been razed to the ground.*

*“Everything that had been along that three-kilometre stretch just disappeared,” said Fernando Avaria, the first pilot to fly over the area after the disaster.*

*The cemetery, the churches, sports facilities and the area’s only school were reduced to planks of wood and broken glass. The buildings of the local authority simply disappeared.*

*“It was devastating, really out of a horror film,” said Margot Salas, a local who toured the area with Chilean state television cameras almost 24 hours after the disaster.*

*As the sea receded, Robinson Crusoe Island faced a new flood – one of despair. Mud covered everything within three kilometres of the coast.*
