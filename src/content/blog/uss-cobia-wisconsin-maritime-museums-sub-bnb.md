An interesting bit of news from the [Sea History Today](https://seahistory.org/seahistorytoday/), the [National Maritime Historical Society](https://seahistory.org/)’s newsletter. One of the more popular programs at the [Wisconsin Maritime Museum](https://cts.vresp.com/c/?NationalMaritimeHist/b21145535e/74af2972df/af81f8b60b) (WMM) in Manitowoc involves arranging for youth groups to spend the night in the museum’s WWII-era submarine, *Cobia*. Over the past 23 years, about 60,000 people—mostly scout groups—have spent the night in the submarine, which has been painstakingly restored. The program was so popular that many groups booked a year or more in advance. The program was so successful that WMW even considered expanding it to include AirBnB lodgings for adults.

Then the pandemic struck. WMM had to close its doors temporarily, and limitations on in-person group activities put an end to youth overnights in *Cobia*, bringing an estimated shortfall of $100,000 in revenue traditionally generated by them.

Shelley Reid, NMHS senior staff writer writes: The museum leadership decided to commit to the Airbnb option, reaching out to museums with established adult overnight-stay programs for their valuable advice. The result is [Sub BnB](https://cts.vresp.com/c/?NationalMaritimeHist/b21145535e/74af2972df/ccccc6de16), which launched in the beginning of September and attracted nearly a dozen bookings those first few weeks. Guests are provided with sea bags containing bedding and toiletries, and can choose from the 65 bunks located throughout the sub. A dedicated museum staff member is on hand for the duration of the overnight, to answer questions, accompany explorations of the sub, and provide a guided tour of the museum if desired. The vessel has a new HVAC system and air purifiers located throughout, and it is thoroughly cleaned, along with the bedding, between guest stays. A recent guest had nothing but high marks for the experience:  

“ …\[W\]e were introduced to \[the\] staff and treated like celebrities. …Shane gave us a first class personal tour of the facilities and an in-depth tour of the *Cobia* including visits to parts of the ship not open to the general public. That evening Abbie drove us to a great restaurant and picked us up with popcorn and snacks in tow for a special movie night just for us in the theatre at the museum. …\[The next morning\] we had our own private time to go through the fabulous multi-story museum before Abbie once again drove us to the boat dock. Yes, a very unique experience that I would highly recommend for a family or a small group. Many fond memories!”

The museum is happy with the new offering as well. Not only does the income from the new program help offset the financial impact of the Coronavirus pandemic, a loss estimated at about half of their typical revenue, but it draws new visitors to the museum and strengthens its connection with the greater community. The museum’s director of education and programs, Abigail Diaz, put it this way: “For small groups and families, Sub BnB provides a safe and engaging place to experience history firsthand. While our youth overnight program is incredibly popular and successful, it’s been fantastic to reach new audiences and create new relationships with Sub BnB.”
