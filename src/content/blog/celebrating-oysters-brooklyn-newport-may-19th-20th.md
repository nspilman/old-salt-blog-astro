![billioneoysterparty16](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/05/billioneoysterparty16.jpg)Next week is a great week for oysters if you are in the Northeast. Next Thursday is the [Billion Oyster Party](http://www.billionoysterparty.com/) in Brooklyn, NY, while on Friday, the [Newport Oyster Festival](http://www.bowenswharf.com/newport-oyster-festival) will be kicked off with an [Opening Night Party](http://www.bowenswharf.com/newport-oyster-festival/opening-night-party) at Bowen’s Wharf in Newport, RI.

On Thursday night, May 19th, the [Billion Oyster Project](http://www.billionoysterproject.org/) is hosting the [Third Annual Billion Oyster Party](http://www.billionoysterparty.com/) in Brooklyn, NY. The party will feature oysters from 40 oyster farms from all over the U.S. from Washington to Louisiana to New York. The oysters from around the country each have their own delicate flavor and all of the farmers have stories to tell, as they shuck an estimated 20,000 oysters.

Fifteen New York restaurants will be joining in with other great munchies. Soda, beer, wine, and spirits will be available to help wash it all down as you watch the BOP All-Star Shucking Championship!  Proceeds from the event will support the five program areas of the Billion Oyster Project: Reef Construction & Monitoring, Shell Collection, BOP Schools, Oyster Production and Public Engagement.  The Billion Oyster Project, in partnership with the New York Harbor School, aims at restoring one billion live oysters to New York Harbor and while engaging hundreds of thousands of school children through restoration based STEM education programs.
