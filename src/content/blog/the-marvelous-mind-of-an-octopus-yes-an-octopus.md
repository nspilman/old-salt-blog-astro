This is an amazing presentation from a website called “[everybody loves cephalopods](http://www.boingboing.net/2011/01/27/octo.html).”  (I know that I do, usually lightly fried.)  I have to admit that after watching this excerpt from a 30 minute presentation by Maggie Koerth-Baker that I am indeed fascinated by octopus brains.  Definitely worth a look.
