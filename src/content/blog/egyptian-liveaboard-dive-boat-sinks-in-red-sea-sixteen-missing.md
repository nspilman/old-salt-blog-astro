![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/seastory.png)The [*Sea Story*](https://diveproliveaboard.com/fleet/m-y-sea-story/), a 44m Egyptian tourist liveaboard dive boat, sank in the Red Sea early this morning. Of the 44 aboard, including 13 crew, 28 were rescued while 16 remain missing. The crew was all Egyptian, while the tourists were reported to be from a mix of countries including Great Britain, the US, Finland, Germany, China, Spain, and Poland. It is unclear who is among the rescued and who is still missing.

The *Sea Story* left port near Marsa Alam on Sunday for a five-day diving trip. The vessel sent a distress signal at 05:30 (03:30 GMT).

Authorities have not indicated the possible cause of the incident but added accounts of people onboard mentioned a wave hit the boat and caused it to capsize. The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2m7z9xpndo) reports that weather forecasters had warned against marine activities for Sunday and Monday.

Wind speeds were reported to be between 37-43 mph (60-70 km/h), and wave heights were three to four meters (10-13ft) high, at the time the dive boat sank.

Marsa Alam is a popular destination for tourists on Egypt’s southern Red Sea coast and is surrounded by diving spots, including renowned coral reefs. 

The Red Sea governorate said the boat was owned by an Egyptian national, and had received a one-year validity certificate in March 2024 when it was inspected by maritime safety. There was no immediate comment from *Sea Story*‘s Egypt-based owner and operator, [Dive Pro Liveaboard](https://diveproliveaboard.com/).

*Sea Story* is at least the fifth liveaboard dive boat to sink in the Egyptian Red Sea in the last 18 months. Three British nationals died in a [fire on the dive boat](https://www.reuters.com/world/three-british-tourists-dead-after-boat-fire-egypts-red-sea-2023-06-12/) *Hurricane* in June 2023. In February 2024, a German woman died following a fire onboard the Dive Pro Liveaboard-operated [MY *Sea Legend*](https://divemagazine.com/scuba-diving-news/german-woman-missing-presumed-dead-after-red-sea-liveaboard-fire-disaster), which subsequently sank.  The liveaboard dive boat [*Exocet* sank in the Red Sea](https://divemagazine.com/scuba-diving-news/popular-french-liveaboard-exocet-sinks-near-marsa-alam) after striking coral reefs near Marsa Alam, Egypt last June. All aboard, including 24 divers were rescued. Last October, the MY [*Seaduction* sank in heavy weather](https://divemagazine.com/scuba-diving-news/red-sea-liveaboard-sinks-in-egypts-south-18-divers-rescued). The 18 divers and 10 crew were all rescued.
