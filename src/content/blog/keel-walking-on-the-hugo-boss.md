![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/715619-keel-walk.jpg)The photos look Photoshopped. A man wearing a dark suit stands on the exposed articulated keel of the Open 60 racing sail boat, *Hugo Boss,* as she sails along heeled over on her starboard gunnel.  The photo and several similar showed up in ads for Hugo Boss men’s wear. But they have to be fake right?   The owner of the boat and the model for the shoot, Alex Thomspon says, no.  He repeated his “keel walking” but this time on video to show the world exactly how it is done.

The note on the [You Tube video](http://youtu.be/B2PQfJ2SAg4) reads: *8 tonnes of carbon fibre yacht, a 255 horsepower jet ski, 45 combined years of sailing experience, and one crazy guy in a suit.  Alex Thomson attempts what he calls ‘The Keel Walk’, a stunt that has become infamous throughout the world thanks to the iconic image of Alex ‘riding’ the keel of his 60ft yacht ‘HUGO BOSS’.  [Click here for a photo galley of Thomson “Keel Walking.”](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/photo-gallery/gallery-e6frf94x-1226261717141)*
