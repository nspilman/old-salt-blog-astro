![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/03/855153.jpg)Harold ‘Dynamite’ Payson died suddenly of an an aneurysm at his home in Maine on March 23rd. He was 82.

His message was simple.  As expressed in his [books](http://www.amazon.com/Harold-H.-Payson/e/B000AP9FF6/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0) and on his [webpage](http://www.instantboats.com/dynamite.htm),” *Harold H. Payson … known to associates, friends, and his wife as Dynamite… thinks you can build a boat.   In fact, if you can saw a penciled line, apply glue, drive nails, and bring a modest measure of patience to the task, you can build and launch a smart and able craft in as few as 40 work hours. You need not be driven by lack of tools, materials, skills, or time to abandon in frustration a project you conceived in a spirit of pleasurable anticipation.”*  
  
Payson was a boatbuilder in Maine who also offered plans for sale. He discovered that the plans were too complicated for many of his customers so he sat down with the legendary designer Phil Bolger to come up with boats that could be built by anyone – boats that were simple, cheap and easy; three words not often associated with boat building.  Bolger, who was noted for his creative and often idiosyncratic designs, agreed to work with Payson under one condition. Payson would have to build each of the designs and work out the bugs in construction and on the water.   Payson readily agreed.   For more than 25 years, Payson’s “[Instant Boats](http://www.instantboats.com/)” have changed home boat building forever.

In addition to selling plans, [Dynamite Payson wrote a series of entertaining books](http://www.amazon.com/Harold-H.-Payson/e/B000AP9FF6/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0) about boat building and model making.   His [Build the New Instant Boats](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934982040/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934982040), first released in 1984, was reissued in November of 2010, and is also available in Kindle format.  [Instant Boatbuilding with Dynamite Payson: 15 Instant Boats for Power, Sail, Oar, and Paddle](http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=tholsabl-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=0071472649) was released in 2007.
