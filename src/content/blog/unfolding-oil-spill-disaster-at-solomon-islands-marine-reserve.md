![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/03/solomontrader.jpg)Almost a month ago, the bulk carrier [*Solomon Trader*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/SOLOMON-TRADER-IMO-9075670-MMSI-477690400) was driven onto a reef on Rennell Island in the Solomon Islands by Cyclone Oma. Since then the 74,000 DWT ship has been leaking oil which threatens to destroy a world heritage-listed marine sanctuary.

Of the estimated 700 tonnes of fuel oil aboard, 75 tonnes has leaked onto the [Rennell Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rennell) shoreline. Rennell Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is the home to the largest [raised coral atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raised_coral_atoll) in the world contains many endemic species.

Australia is sending help. “Australia remains extremely concerned by the ongoing risk of a major oil spill,” said the foreign minister, Marise Payne, in a statement on Sunday, as reported by the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/03/solomon-islands-oil-leak-australia-sends-more-help-amid-environmental-fears).

“Up to 75 tonnes of heavy fuel oil from the ship has dispersed across the Island’s sea and shoreline, contaminating the ecologically delicate area.

“Given escalating ecological damage and a lack of action by commercial entities involved, the Solomon Islands Government has requested Australia’s assistance.”

Payne said in response, Australia was sending equipment, vessels, and experts under the leadership of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.

Indonesian firm Bintan Mining SI chartered the ship to take bauxite from its mine on the western half of Rennell Island to China. The bulk carrier ran aground while loading bauxite during a cyclone
