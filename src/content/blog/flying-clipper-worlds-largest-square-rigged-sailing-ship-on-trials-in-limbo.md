![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/flyingclipperdock.jpg)For the past several years, [we have followed the construction of the newest and largest square-rigged luxury passenger cruise ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/06/update-flying-clipper-worlds-largest-square-rigged-sailing-ship-launched/) built for the [Star Clipper](https://www.starclippers.com/us-dom) cruise fleet — the [*Flying Clipper*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Clipper).  Recently, the 300 passenger, five-masted bark has been seen on trials off Split. Unfortunately, the ship, built by the Croatian [shipyard Brodosplit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodosplit), is also sailing in limbo.

[Total Croatia News](https://www.total-croatia-news.com/lifestyle/38685-split) reports that the 70 million euro contract between Brodosplit and Star Clippers owner Mikhail Krafft has recently been terminated because both sides claimed that it had been violated: Krafft had exceeded delivery deadlines for masts and rigging and the Split shipyard failed to meet the conditions for completion. The dispute is moving towards arbitration, but, according to unofficial information, negotiations over a possible compromise are also in progress.

In the meantime, the ship is sailing under the name *Brodosplit 483*. Brodosplit told [Seatrade Cruise News](https://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news/news-headlines/star-clippers-and-brodosplit-in-dispute-over-flying-clipper-delivery/) it is no longer obliged to hand over the ship to the buyer and is free to dispose of the newbuilding adding ‘there is a great deal of interest in this unique vessel.’

The new ship is modeled after the five-masted [*France II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_II) of 1912.  She will set 68,000 square feet of sail, or over twice the sail area of the clipper ship *Cutty Sark*. She is said to the largest square-rigged ship in the world.

Star Clippers owns and operates the ship that had been the world’s largest, the five-masted [*Royal Clipper*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Clipper). The company also operates the sister ships, *Star* *Clipper* and *Star Flyer*, which are four-masted barquentines.
