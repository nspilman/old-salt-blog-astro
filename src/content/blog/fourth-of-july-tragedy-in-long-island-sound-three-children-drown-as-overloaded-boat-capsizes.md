Silverton 34, a similar motor yacht to the Kandi Won which capsized on July 4th

We have blogged too often about the loss of life after overcrowded boats capsized off [Indonesia](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/21/asylum-seekers-boat-capsizes-north-of-australias-christmas-island-200-believed-aboard/), [India](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/05/02/update-assam-ferry-tragedy-no-clear-death-toll-yet/), [Bangladesh](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/03/14/at-least-114-dead-after-ferry-mv-shariatpur-1-capsizes-in-bangladesh/) and [Papau New Guinea](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/02/03/update-mv-rabaul-queen-247-rescued-more-than-110-missing/).  This week was sad reminder that the problem of overloaded boats is not limited to the developing world.  On Wednesday evening a group of 27 people went out in the the *Kandi Won,* a 34 foot long Silverton motor yacht, to watch the Fourth of July fireworks over Long Island Sound, near Oyster Bay.  Shortly after the fireworks were over, at around 10PM, the yacht was hit by a wave and capsized. Twenty four people were pulled from the water, but three children; a 12-year-old boy, his 11-year-old cousin and an 8-year-old girl; were drowned in the boat’s cabin.

The motor yacht is being raised today from where it sank off the mouth of Oyster Bay, in 60′ feet of water. The investigation into the cause of f the tragedy is ongoing.
