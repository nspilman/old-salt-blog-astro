Here is wonderful drone footage by [Ryan Smith](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA0DX6uFgFw9YKqwL6j6Gag) of the [Massachusetts Maritime Academy](https://www.maritime.edu/)‘s school ship [TS *Kennedy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TS_Kennedy) as it departs for its Sea Term 2020. The ship sails down Buzzard’s Bay bound for Panama where it will transit the Canal. The ship will cross the Equator and make port calls in Balboa, Panama; Golfito, Costa Rica; Willemstad, Curacao; and Tampa, Florida. 

The *Kennedy* was built as a C-4 class breakbulk freighter, the *Velma Lykes*, at Avondale Industries, New Orleans, LA, for Lykes Brothers Steamship Company in 1966. She has served as Mass. Maritime’s school ship since 2003. *Kennedy* was deployed to New York Harbor in support of Hurricane Sandy relief efforts in 2012 and Hurricane Maria at Puerto Rico in 2017.
