![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/08/roundaround.jpg)In March of 2018, we posted about a pilot project led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS) to develop [autonomous barges, referred to as “roboats”,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/03/roboats-in-the-canals-of-amsterdam/) to carry cargo and passengers on Amsterdam’s 100 km of canals.  Now MIT and AMS have developed a new application for the roboats. In a project known as [roundAround](https://www.ams-institute.org/news/roundaround-the-worlds-first-dynamic-bridge-made-of-autonomous-boats/), a fleet of autonomous boats would run between the island of Kattenburg to the east of Amsterdam and the city center.

The boats would move in a continuous circle across the canal, picking up and dropping off passengers via a charging station. Currently, walkers have to make a 1km detour to make the crossing. 

As reported by [Global Construction Review](http://www.globalconstructionreview.com/news/amsterdam-floats-bridge-made-autonomous-boasts/), the boats would be equipped with cameras and LIDAR technology powered by artificial intelligence, which would improve safety and efficiency. The roboats could also be used to transport rubbish or construction materials, alleviating road congestion.

Carlo Ratti, architect and MIT professor, said: “RoundAround is one of the first proposed applications of Roboat, our research in collaboration with AMS Institute. 

“The Roboats will autonomously respond to and learn from the dynamics of this Amsterdam waterway. As they operate, the system will become increasingly more intelligent and well-equipped to be implemented in other parts of the city and other cities worldwide.”

Stephan van Dijk, AMS’ head of research, said: “Bridging this waterway truly challenges urban engineers, as it’s an important fixed mast route for bigger boats. This makes it challenging to design an accessible bridge across this canal. 

“With Roboat as a dynamic infrastructure we can potentially connect the two areas and use roundAround as a living lab to develop on-site experience on how autonomous boats behave on the Amsterdam canals.”

In the 17th century, the Eastern Islands; Kattenburg, Wittenburg and Oostenburg; were home to the Dutch shipping industry.
