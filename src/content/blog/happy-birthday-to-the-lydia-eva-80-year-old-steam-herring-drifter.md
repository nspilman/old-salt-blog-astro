*The world’s last surviving steam drifter, the [Lydia Eva](http://www.lydiaeva.org.uk/lydia_eva_history.htm)**, will be celebrating her 80th birthday in Great Yarmouth on Sunday.   As well as celebrating her birthday, the weekend will also mark the completion of a £1.2m restoration project of the vessel.*

*Throughout the weekend, people will be able to go on board the Lydia Eva as she is in steam at South Quay and see her triple extension engine and Scotch boilers.  On Sunday, her birthday will be celebrated with sea shanties, cooked herring and a beer tent.*
