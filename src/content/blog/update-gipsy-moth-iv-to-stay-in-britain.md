![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/11/gipsymoth1.jpg)In September, we posted that the *[Gipsy Moth IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gipsy_Moth_IV),* the famous yacht sailed by [Sir Francis Chichester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Chichester) singlehanded around the world was for sale.   Last week, it was reported that two anonymous donors  donated more than £250,000 to the United Kingdom Sailing Academy (UKSA), the charity that owns the yacht, to allow it to continue to sail the *Gipsy Moth IV* to help train young sailors.

*The new owners (who wish to remain anonymous at this stage), commented: “We are delighted to be in a position to keep such a historic yacht available to the public. We are both of an age that we remember Sir Francis returning to Plymouth and it’s lovely to be able to safeguard her future as well as keeping her sailing.*

*We’re looking forward to working closely with UKSA and the steering committee that is being set up to make sure that she is seen by as many people as possible at high profile events and to raise awareness of the fantastic work that UKSA does with disabled and disadvantaged young people.”*
