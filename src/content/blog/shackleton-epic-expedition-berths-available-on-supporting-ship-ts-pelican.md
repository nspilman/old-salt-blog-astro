[![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/09/WebBanner_Intrepid_600.jpg)](http://www.intrepidtravel.com/shackleton)[Shackleton Epic Expeditions](http://shackletonepic2013.com/) has announced the availability of 10 berths on [T/S *Pelican*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_of_London) when it serves as a support vessel for the upcoming re-enactment of an epic lifeboat voyage undertaken by [Ernest Shackleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton) and five sailors in 1916. The *Pelican* is a 148ft long three-masted barquentine.  See our previous post for a video of the [*Pelican* under sail in the Thamse Estuary at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/05/29/on-board-the-pelican-of-london-a-diamond-jubilee-thames-pageant-tall-ship/) last May.

Last March [we posted about the upcoming re-enactment](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/03/24/recreating-sir-ernest-shackletons-epic-lifeboat-voyage/) of the epic lifeboat voyage  In 1916, Shackleton and his crew set off on an 1300 kilometer voyage to South Georgia Island, across some of roughest waters in the world, in the *James Caird*, a 6.9 meter lifeboat, in a desperate attempt to reach help and to arrange the rescue of the twenty two men left behind on Elephant Island. The re-enactment; in a replica of the *James Caird*, named the *Alexandra Shackleton*, in honor of the explorer’s granddaughter; will be attempted in September 2013.

From the Shackleton Epic Expeditions website:

*Offering Shackleton enthusiasts and members of the public an extraordinary opportunity to be a part of the expedition, Shackleton Epic’s presenting partner, Intrepid Travel, is making available ten berths aboard the expedition support vessel TS Pelican. This majestic tall ship is similar in size to Shackleton’s original expedition ship, Endurance. “A berth on TS Pelican as part of the Shackleton re-creation is the stuff of childhood dreams,” says Tim Jarvis, AM FRGS, 46-year-old British/Australian adventurer and Shackleton Epic expedition leader.*
