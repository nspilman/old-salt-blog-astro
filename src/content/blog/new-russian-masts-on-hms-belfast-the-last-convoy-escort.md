New Masts for HMS Belfast

The *[HMS Belfast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Belfast_\(C35\))*, a Royal Navy light cruiser, now a museum ship on the Thames, is the last surviving  escort ship from [the Arctic convoy run to Russia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_convoys_of_World_War_II) during World War II.  Last week, in a ceremony attended by HRH Prince Philip, The Duke of Edinburgh, and the Head of the Russian presidential administration, Sergey Naryshkin, new masts, fabricated in the “Severnaya Verf” shipyard in St. Petersburg, Russia, were unveiled.

[Russian and British Veterans of the Arctic Convoys Celebrated the Unveiling of Russian Masts on HMS Belfast in London](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/russian-and-british-veterans-of-the-arctic-convoys-celebrated-the-unveiling-of-russian-masts-on-hms-belfast-in-london-105518393.html)  
  
*The masts restoration project was supported by Russian companies [United Industrial Corporation](http://eng.opk.ru/), [Severstal](http://www.severstal.com/eng/index.phtml) and [Sovcomflot](http://www.sovcomflot.ru/) in recognition of the heroism of the Arctic Convoys 1941-1945. HMS Belfast, which stands on the River Thames in London, is “the last witness” and the only remaining warship that escorted convoys during the Second World War.*

*The Head of the annual Victory Day celebrations in London and Chairman of Russia’s Finance & Investments Market Players Club, Eugene Kasevin, who was accompanying Russian veterans on their trip to London, said that “this restoration project of HMS Belfast masts is a fine example of Russian generosity and respect for the historical friendship between Russia and Britain.”*
