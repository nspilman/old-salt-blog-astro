Nasco Diamond

On Thursday morning, *Nasco Diamond* loaded with 55,000 tonnes of nickel ore from Indonesia to China was reported missing and believed to have sunk off the southern coast of Japan.  Five of the twenty five crew have been accounted for, with at least one fatality.  Empty rafts and oil slicks were seen near where the crew members were rescued.  Japanese and Taiwanese Coast Guards continue to search for the remaining missing twenty crew.

Today the International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners, [Intercargo](http://www.intercargo.org/), issued a statement about the risks of transporting nickel ore.   If the moisture content in the ore is too high, the water in the ore can separate during the voyage, creating a free surface effect which can destabilize a ship and potentially lead to capsizing.
