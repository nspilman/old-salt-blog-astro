USS Essex

A [Department of Justice statement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-navy-sailor-convicted-spying-china) announced that on Aug. 20, a federal jury convicted Jinchao Wei, also known as Patrick Wei, of espionage and export violations. Wei was an active-duty US Navy sailor stationed at Naval Base San Diego when he agreed to sell Navy secrets to a Chinese intelligence officer for $12,000.

Following a five-day trial and one day of deliberation, the jury convicted Wei of six counts, including conspiracy to commit espionage, espionage, and unlawful export of, and conspiracy to export, technical data related to defense articles in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Wei is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 1.

Both espionage and conspiracy to commit espionage carry life sentences, as well as a $250,000 fine.

The conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act and each count of violating the act carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison, as well as $1 million fine.

According to evidence presented at trial, Wei was a machinist’s mate for the amphibious assault ship *USS Essex*. He also held a US security clearance and had access to sensitive national defense information about the ship’s various systems.

The evidence introduced at trial showed that Wei was approached in February 2022 via social media by someone who claimed to be a naval enthusiast. The individual was, in reality, a Chinese intelligence officer.

Between February 2022 and his arrest in August 2023, as their relationship developed, Wei, at the request of the officer, sent extensive information about the *Essex*, including photographs, videos, and about its weapons. He also sent detailed information about other US Navy ships that he took from restricted U.S. Navy computer systems. 

[Wei was arrested alongside Petty Officer Wenheng Zhao](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66365641), who was arrested on charges of accepting more than $14,800 for sending sensitive photos and videos to a Chinese intelligence officer.

Prosecutors said Zhao transmitted “plans for a large-scale maritime training exercise in the Pacific theatre, operational orders and electrical diagrams and blueprints for a Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar system located in Okinawa, Japan”.

Zhao was found guilty last year and sentenced to 27 months in prison.
