![ohp-haul-out-pr](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ohp-haul-out-pr.jpg)The [SSV](http://www.ohpri.org/) *[Oliver Hazard Perry](http://www.ohpri.org/),* the largest square-rigged sailing ship built in this country in over 100 years, is nearing completion.  The 132′ long three masted steel ship has been hauled at at [Newport Shipyard](http://newportshipyard.com/) for final exterior work and painting. On the west coast, the [Spar Shop](http://thesparshop.org/index.php) at [Gray’s Harbor Historical Seaport](http://historicalseaport.org/) fabricated the masts, yards and spars on the largest tracer-lathe in North America.  The masts, yards and spars have been delivered to the *Perry*‘s crew of riggers in Portsmouth, R.I. who are finishing the standing rigging.  Likewise, [Hood Sailmakers](http://www.hood-sails.com/)  is completing the ship’s 14,000 square feet of sails.  

From the [OHP press release](http://www.ohpri.org/news-details/maritime-history-in-the-making): 

*“The Perry is a modern, steel-hulled ocean-going civilian sail training vessel, with a 13 ½ story rig and 20 sails (made by Hood Sailmakers in Middletown, R.I.) with 14,000 sq. ft. of sail area,” says the ship’s Captain Richard Bailey, a Wellfleet, Mass. native greatly respected for his previous Tall Ship commands and his knowledge of maritime traditions, education and their combined relevance in the modern world. “Her design is based on centuries-old tradition, but her equipment is anything but antiquated.”*

*In addition to her three decks, modern galley and Great Cabin (where captains, in days of yore, entertained), the Perry sports, among other things, high-end navigation and communication systems, a state-of-the-art science lab (designed under the guidance of the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography), and wheelchair accessibility (including accessible below deck staterooms, heads and a wheelchair lift). The Great Cabin will be used less for entertaining and more for education in its capacity as a classroom outfitted with monitors displaying real-time navigation and meteorological data. The other classroom space will house laptop computers (donated by Intel), interactive SMART boards (donated by Shanix Technologies, Inc.) and a well-stocked library.*

*“Below decks, she is really not like any other Tall Ship that is sailing out there today,” says Bailey, who notably ran “HMS” Rose for 20 years before it was bought by Hollywood producers for the movie Master and Commander. “Above decks, however, she is a completely traditional Tall Ship, and in that respect there are many artisans who will have had a hand in contributing to her character.”*

*By the nature of sailing itself, the SSV Oliver Hazard Perry will be energy efficient, powered by the wind whenever possible. To reduce its energy footprint further, the ship’s diesel engines and generators will run on biodiesel (supplied by Newport Biodiesel), and ultra-high capability Ensolve separators will cleanse oily waste water down to 2-15 ppm using naturally occurring microbes. On board, the focus will be on sustainable living: conserving water, minimizing trash and reducing food waste. Trash will be separated and all plastics taken ashore for recycling, while black water will be treated in an onboard waste water treatment plant.*

*“It is expected that with all these ecologically responsible practices in place, along with first-hand experiences of the fragility of ocean life, a sense of pride, stewardship and passion for the marine environment will be instilled in our shipmates,” Bailey said.*

To celebrate the arrival of the newest sail training ship, the non-profit [Oliver Hazard Perry Rhode Island](http://www.ohpri.org/about) will be holding a [fundraising gala at the Newport Shipyard on July 5, 2014](http://www.ohpri.org/events). The event will pay tribute to the completion of Rhode Island’s official Sailing Education Vessel; and honor the organization’s three shipyard partners – Newport Shipyard, Senesco Marine and New England Boatworks – which have demonstrated the outstanding quality of Rhode Island’s skilled marine trades. Throughout the evening, guests will be able to tour the ship at dockside and participate in a live and silent auction, all while enjoying cocktails, dinner and dessert. Proceeds from the night will go toward the organization’s educational programs.

Tickets must be purchased in advance, and will sell out fast! For more information contact Carol Hill, 401-841-0080
