![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lionfish1.jpg)Sometime in the 1990s, two different species of [lionfish](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lionfish-facts.html) made it into the waters of the Atlantic off Florida. Native to the Indo-Pacific, the venomous, predatory fish [spread rapidly,](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lionfish.html) decimating local reef fish in the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean. Lacking local predators to stop its spreading, the lionfish have been described as “[one of the most aggressively invasive species on the planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterois)“. So far, the most effective means of slowing the spread of the fish is for divers to spear them, a relatively slow and challenging approach.

I recently came across a video from 2015, showing a grouper eating a lionfish. Groupers and sharks are natural predators for the lionfish in the Pacific, but the Atlantic and Caribbean groupers have been slow to adapt to considering the new invader as a food source. Are local [groupers and other predators](https://www.caymancompass.com/2014/04/16/sharks-grouper-learn-to-prey-on-lionfish/) developing a taste for lionfish? About the video:

*On location with Lionfish University in Little Cayman on February 1st, 2015 at Black Hole, Preston Bay Marine Park, the following video was filmed by JV Hart (Lionfish University co-founder) this grouper took a lionfish to lunch… and ate it.*

*The following video is uninterrupted, continuous coverage of an encounter between a Nassau Grouper and a lionfish with no interference, other than that of a diver being present with a camera, and, may be the first photo* *documentation of a grouper making an open water kill of an invasive lionfish without encouragement of any kind by a diver.* 

*There is controversy among experts who have viewed the video as to whether the grouper herded the lionfish into open water for the kill, or whether it followed the lionfish.*

*Please advise at LionfishUniversity@gmail.com of any recorded or observed similar interactions between grouper/sharks/snapper/eels and lionfish, and where they occurred.*
