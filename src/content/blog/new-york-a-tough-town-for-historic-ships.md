A recent article in the TribecaTribOnline was titled, “[*Two Historic Sailing Ships Could Dock at Seaport This Summer*.](http://tribecatrib.com/content/two-historic-sailing-ships-could-dock-seaport-summer)” The story is that Jonathan Boulware, the [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/)’s interim president, is working very hard to arrange dock space for the replica frigate *l’[Hermione](http://www.hermione2015.com/)* and the [US Coast Guard Cutter *Eagle*](http://www.cga.edu/eagle/) at the Seaport this summer.  *l’Hermione* is a reconstruction of the 1779 French ship that ferried General Marquis de Lafayette to the U.S. during the Revolutionary War and the USCGC *Eagle* is a sail training ship based at the Coast Guard Academy in New London.  It sounds like an excellent idea, notwithstanding a few logistical issues. In fact, it may be more daunting than it appears at first.

[Richard Shrubb](http://boatingtimesli.com/NY/author/richard-shrubb/) recently posed the question in BoatingTimesLI.com, “[Are Historic Ships Welcome in New York Harbor?](http://boatingtimesli.com/NY/are-historic-ships-welcome-in-new-york-harbor/)”  The answer to the question may not exactly be “no,” but it is still a considerable distance from “yes.”  Shrubb quotes Mary Habstritt, the founder of the [Historic Ships Coalition](http://www.waterfrontalliance.org/partners/historic-ships-coalition), who notes that “*for short term stays, it is very hard to track down who you need to get a berth in New York Harbor. There are a huge number of pier operators, and no central directory for visiting ships to contact.*”

The costs are also high. For short term docking, the city can charge up to $10.00 per linear foot per night, which in the case of the USCG Cutter *Eagle* could cost around $9,000 for a weekend, before adding in charges for water, electricity and other services which could drive the costs far higher.  The cost of insurance can also a factor. According to Donald Liloia, vice president of a major pier operator, Dock NYC, “The burden for operators is $20 million in coverage,” explains Liloia. “*This makes it very difficult for small scale ship operators to keep a ship in the area*.”

The largest issue is simply the shortage of dock space. The island of Manhattan, which was once fringed with docks, has very few remaining. If Jonathan Boulware at the South Street Seaport succeeds in hosting *Hermione* and the USCGC *Eagle,* he will need to find more dock space.  The museum once used Piers 14 through 18 to for dockage. Now, it only has Pier 16, and temporarily, the north side of Pier 15.  The space they have access to currently is in use.

Sadly, one historic ship will not be needing dockage in New York any longer. The [*Half Moon*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/10/replica-of-henry-hudsons-ship-half-moon-may-move-to-netherlands/), replica of the ship Henry Hudson used to explore the river that bears his name, is leaving New York state after years of failing to find a supportive home.  Despite promises of support from the state, the ship never found a home on the Hudson River.  This spring [she will be loaded on a heavy-lift ship](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Half-Moon-s-transatlantic-journey-nears-6099253.php) to be carried across the Atlantic to serve as a museum ship at the [Westfries Museum](http://www.westfriesmuseum.info/) in the Dutch city of Hoorn.
