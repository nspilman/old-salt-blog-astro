![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/canopee.jpg)In 2021, [we posted about the start of construction of a sail-assisted cargo ship](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/05/dutch-shipyard-to-build-canopee-french-rocket-ship-with-wing-sails/), built to carry Ariane 6 rockets for the European Space Agency (ESA).  Now, the ro-ro cargo ship, *Canopée,* has completed sea trials and is ready to begin commercial service carrying launcher parts from European ports to the Pariacabo port in Kourou, French Guiana.

In addition to diesel propulsion, the 121-meter long *Canopée* is equipped with four 30-meter high [Oceanwing](https://ayro.fr/oceanwing/)s, automated and reefable soft wingsails.

The Oceanwing sails, developed by [AYRO](https://ayro.fr/), each have a surface area of 363 square meters. The sails consist of two flaps, one forward and one aft. The design makes it possible to adjust the angle of incidence of the wings, which turn 360 degrees in relation to the wind while the rear flap can pivot around the secondary mast to create a camber in relation to the front flap. The sails are collapsible. 

According to AYRO, the wings generate far more power than conventional sails or single-element wings. They expect the ship will sail at speeds of up to 16 knots to meet its commercial schedule. The proportion of wind power use will vary between 15 and 40 percent, depending on the required speed and wind conditions, which are expected to vary by season. The vessel is also fitted with two diesel engines that provide 3,840 kW. With the four wings, the ship aims to reduce fuel consumption by on average around 30 percent.

[Maritime Executive](https://maritime-executive.com/article/ro-ro-cargo-ship-for-european-space-agency-unfurls-its-sails) reports that the contract calls for the vessel to make up to 12 crossings per year. She is operating under a 15-year agreement to supply components for the Ariane 6 space program managed and financed by the European Space Agency. *Canopée* is operated by Alizés, a joint venture between Zéphyr & Borée and Jifmar Offshore Services, and she is registered under the French International Flag.
