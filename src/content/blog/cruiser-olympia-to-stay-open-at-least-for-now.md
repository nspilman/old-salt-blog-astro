The troubled [Independence Seaport Museum](http://www.phillyseaport.org/) in Philadelphia announced on Monday that it would continue to keep the cruiser *[ex USS Olympia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Olympia_\(C-6\))* open though the end of the year and shift to a three day schedule through the end of March.

*The Olympia – last surviving warship of the Spanish-American War of 1898 – may still be scrapped or face a watery grave as an artificial reef off Cape May without money for restoration.*

*But the Penn’s Landing attraction will not close as originally planned Monday after the Independence Seaport Museum’s decision, announced late Wednesday, to fund interim repairs.*

*The museum plans to hold a summit early next year with the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command, National Park Service, and Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission to determine what steps can be taken to save the ship.*

*The summit will bring together leaders from historic-preservation agencies, maritime museums, government, economic development, and tourism as well as representatives from the Friends of the Cruiser Olympia and potential funders.*
