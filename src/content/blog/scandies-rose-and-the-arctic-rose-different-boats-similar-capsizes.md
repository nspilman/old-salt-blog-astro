![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/articrosemystery.jpg)On New Year’s Eve, in 20-foot seas and high winds, the 130′ crab boat [*Scandies Rose*](http://scandiesrose.com/?p=1&cpage=1) operating off the Alaska Peninsula, developed a starboard list and suddenly capsized. [Two of the seven crew](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/us/alaska-fishing-boat-sank-scandies-rose-coast-guard.html) were able to don exposure suits and were ultimately rescued. The remaining [five crew are missing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/us/scandies-rose-fishing-boat-alaska.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article) and presumed dead. 

I was struck by the similarities between the loss of the *Scandies Rose* and the [*Arctic Rose*](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/disasters-at-sea/the-arctic-rose-mystery/1005669/3478922), nineteen years ago. The two boats were very different. *Scandies Rose* was a crabber in the Gulf of Alaska, whereas the *Arctic Rose* was a trawler fishing for sole in the Bering Sea.

Like the *Scandies Rose*, the *Arctic Rose* capsized suddenly. Unlike the *Scandies Rose*, the *Arctic Rose* capsized so quickly that there was no time to even make a Mayday call. All fifteen aboard the *Arctic Rose* died. Only the captain, on the bridge, was able to get out and he succumbed to hypothermia before he could be rescued. The loss of the *Arctic Rose* is the most deadly commercial fishing accidents in US waters in more than 50 years.

It is too soon to know why the *Scandies Rose* capsized. For the Coast Guard and NTSB, the sinking of the *Arctic Rose* was a troubling mystery, that would not be solved until they launched a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to search the wreck. The results of the investigation contributed to improved safety standards in the Alaskan fisheries. As evidenced by the recent loss of the *Scandies Rose*, there is still more work to be done.

This Sunday at 9PM, the Smithsonian Channel will air the documentary *[The Arctic Rose](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/disasters-at-sea/the-arctic-rose-mystery/1005669/3478922) [Mystery](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/disasters-at-sea/the-arctic-rose-mystery/1005669/3478922).*  

For the sake of full disclosure, I provide brief commentary in the documentary.
