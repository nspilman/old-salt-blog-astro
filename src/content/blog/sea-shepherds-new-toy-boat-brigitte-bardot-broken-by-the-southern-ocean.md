Brigitte Bardot, the ex-Ocean\_7\_Adventurer

The [reality TV stars,](http://animal.discovery.com/tv/whale-wars/) the [Sea Shepherds](http://www.seashepherd.org/), took their newest speed boat, the *[Brigitte Bardot](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/23/sea-shepherd-farce-continues-with-new-toy-boat-and-movie-star/)*, out on the Southern Ocean recently, which proved to be more than it could handle. The *Brigitte Bardot* reportedly cracked its main hull and severely damaged the port pontoon in heavy seas. No crew were reported to be injured and the boat will return to Freemantle Australia for repairs.

The *Brigitte Bardot* is the ex-*Ocean\_7\_Adventurer*, a high-tech 115 ft stabilized monohull twin diesel powered vessel built built to circumnavigate the world in less than 80 days. (It succeeded in rounding the world in 74 days in 1998.) The Sea Shepherd’s acquired the boat after sinking their previous speed boat, the *Ady Gil*, the ex-*Earthrace*, a biodiesel powered wave-piecing trimaran, which completed a circumnavigation in just 60 days 23 hours and 49 minutes.

Contrary to their claims, the Sea Shepherds do effectively nothing to protect endangered whales by their use of   vigilante  violence. While we do not support the continued Japanese whaling, the minke whales being hunted by the Japanese are not endangered, while the Sea Shepherd violence violates the Law of the Sea and risks the lives of sailors on both sides of the conflict.  While we oppose whaling, violence against seafarers of any nation is not an acceptable nor an effective means of enacting change.
