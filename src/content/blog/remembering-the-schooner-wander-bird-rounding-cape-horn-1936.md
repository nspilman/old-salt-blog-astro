![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/06/wanderbirdbowsprit.jpg)Yesterday we [posted about the sinking of the restored pilot schooner *Elbe No.5*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/06/pilot-schooner-no-5-elbe-ex-wander-bird-sinks-after-collision-on-river-elbe/), ex-*Wander Bird*, following a collision with a container ship near Stade, Germany on the Elbe River. The schooner, launched in 1883, had just completed a $1.7 million renovation. Fortunately while several were injured, none of the 43 passengers and crew died in the collision. An investigation of the incident is ongoing.

The schooner has had a fascinating history. It served as a pilot schooner on the River Elbe for 41 years, carrying pilots to guide ships from the North Sea up the river to the mighty port of Hamburg. She then spent a few years with several owners as a private yacht, named *Wandervogel.* In 1929, the schooner was purchased by American journalist Warwick Tompkins, who translated the German name to *Wander Bird*. 

After sailing the schooner on the US East Coast, including making several transatlantic passages, Tomkins decided to sail *Wander* Bird to San Francisco, around Cape Horn in 1936.  The short video below documents the remarkable passage, which included Tompkins’ two children, Ann, age 6, and Warwick Jr. (nicknamed Commoridre), age 4, as crew. I invite any fellow parent to attempt not to gasp as they watch the two children climbing out on the bowsprit while under sail, without any sort of harness or safety gear.
