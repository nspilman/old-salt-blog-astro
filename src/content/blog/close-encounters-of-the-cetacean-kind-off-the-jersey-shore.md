Two fishermen in a 20-foot boat were fishing approximately one mile off of Deal, Monmouth County when they had a close encounter with a whale. Jonathan Swingle, the boat’s captain, told [ABC 6 News](https://6abc.com/pets-animals/whale-flips-over-boat-at-the-jersey-shore/3980029/) what happened: “So, we’re talking a 30 to 40-foot whale, gotta weigh more than 20 tons. 

“There was a whale that wasn’t breaching. It was actually feeding. You could see it drive up through the mullet – mouth full of fish. Slam it shut and go back down,” he said.

Swingle says the next time it drove up, it hit their boat.

“All of a sudden the boat is being shoved airborne. I got slammed into the gunnel as it was rolling up into my hip and thighs,” Swingle said.

Swingle and his fellow fisherman were thrown into the water. Fortunately, a nearby boat issued a Mayday call and came to the recuse. Swingel suffered from sore legs and hips but was in good spirits.

“The boat’s going to be recoverable, from what I can tell,” Swingle said. “What more can we ask for? It was a fun experience.”

The New Jersey State Police Marine Patrol responded to the distress call. They posted on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/102867543101130/posts/1770519333002601/): 

“Whale vs. Boat — Final Score: Whale 1 – Boat 0 … Charges against the whale are pending its apprehension.”
