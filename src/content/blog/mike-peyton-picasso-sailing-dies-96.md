![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/peyton2.jpg)You may not necessarily know his name, but if you have been reading yachting magazines over the years, his cartoons probably brought a smile to your face. British cartoonist [Mike Peyton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Peyton), who died on January 25th at the age of 96, was described variously as “the world’s greatest yachting cartoonist” and as the “Picasso of sailing.” A lifelong sailor himself, for over sixty years his cartoons captured the joys, sorrows, absurdity and outright silliness of sailing.

In 2012 the Royal Cruising Club gave Peyton their award for lifetime services to yachting. Last year the [Yachting Journalists’ Association](http://www.dominionmarinemedia.com/boats-com-yja-yachtsman-of-the-year-award-2015/) awarded their Diamond Anniversary Lifetime Achievement Award to Peyton. Comedian and sailor Griff Rhys Jones says of Peyton, “He captures the anti-glamour of yachting.” Sir Robin Knox-Johnston says, “Mike’s been my favorite yachting cartoonist for decades.”  At the presentation, Paul Gelder noted: 

*With a few squiggly lines from his pen, he took people to the heart and soul of sailing and sailing’s cock-ups. He was a unique commentator on the sailing scene for more than 60 years. There was no other sailing cartoonist in the world to match his elegant, economical wit and wisdom. He said he got his best ideas sitting in the bath.*

*His humour was gentle, rather than vulgar, brash or cruel. As well as a superb draughtsman, he had a winning way with words, whether it was a clever punch line, a headline or a caption. He was a great storyteller – as anyone who sat beside the glowing coal stove on his boats can testify.*
