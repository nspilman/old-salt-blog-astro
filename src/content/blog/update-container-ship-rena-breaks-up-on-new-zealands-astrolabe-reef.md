![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/01/ipad-art-wide-NZ-420x0.jpg)In early October, the [MV *Rena*, a container ship owned by the Greek shipping company Costamare Inc, ran hard aground](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/05/mv-rena-aground-on-astrolabe-reef-off-tauranga-new-zealand/) on the Astrolabe Reef in in the Bay of Plenty off New Zealand’s North Island.  When she struck the reef, the *Rena* was loaded with approximately 2,100 containers and around 1,700 tonnes of heavy fuel.  With the bow of the ship on the reef and the stern floating, [structural cracking in the hull](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/13/mv-rena-cracking-risking-breaking-up-containers-washing-ashore/) began to appear within two weeks of the grounding. The ship has now finally broken completely in half.  There is now concern that the [stern of the ship](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/08/cargo-ship-rena-breaks-new-zealand) could sink, potentially causing a new oil spill.  Also [between 200 and 300 containers](http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/95506/hundreds-of-containers-lost-after-rena-splits-in-two) are believed to have fallen into the sea when the ship broke up, creating additional hazards to navigation.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing the news along and the Phil Leon for pointing out the video.
