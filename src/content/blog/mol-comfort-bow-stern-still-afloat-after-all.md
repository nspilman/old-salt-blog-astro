In our [post yesterday](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/06/container-ship-mol-comfort-breaks-her-back-and-sinks-off-yemen-crew-rescued/) we described the [*MOL Comfort*](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?mmsi=311006900) as having “sunk.” That was in error. The ship did indeed break in two, but both halves are still afloat, at least according to recent photographs.
