The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/whale-boat-capsize-new-hampshire.html) reports that the Northern New England sector of the Coast Guard received a mayday call for a 23-foot boat that had capsized when a whale shot up from underneath the boat and flopped onto it, about half a mile east of Odiorne Point State Park.

The dramatic flip was [caught on video by Colin Yager](https://x.com/TimCalWMUR/status/1815822013589500029), 16, who was out fishing on another boat nearby, according to WHDH in Boston. He sped over to rescue the two boaters in the water, neither of whom were injured. The whale also appeared to be uninjured, the Coast Guard said.

“It was a harrowing experience,” Gregg Paquette, one of the two passengers knocked over by the whale, told WHDH. He continued, “We were lucky; we were really lucky.”
