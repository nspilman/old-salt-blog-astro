The three-volume *The Principall Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation,* written by Richard Hakluyt in 1599, and published bound as two books, were only expected to sell for between £3,000 and £5,000. Instead, they [sold at an auction for £365,000.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-59609181)

What made the books so valuable was a rare folding 16″ by 18″ (40cms by 45cms) map of the world from 1599-1600 included with the books. Normally when copies are sold, the map is missing.

A spokesman for the auction house in Exeter said: “Unusually, the folding map of the world was present and although in a delicate state, it didn’t deter prospective purchasers.” They said that buyers were interested from “all corners of the globe”.

According to the [John Carter Brown Library](https://jcblibrary.org/collection/principall-navigations-voiages-and-discoveries-english-nation), the map was one of the first printed world maps using the innovative Mercator projection. It was drawn in 1599 by Edward Wright, an English mathematician. His two-sheet world map was published, unattributed to Wright, in Richard Hakluyt’s Principal Navigations…

The books by Hakluyt had been in the same family for many years and were kept in a private library in Devon.
