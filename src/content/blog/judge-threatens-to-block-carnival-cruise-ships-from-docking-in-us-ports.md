![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/04/carnivalcorp1.jpg)On Wednesday, a federal judge decided to get [Carnival Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_Corporation_%26_plc)‘s attention. U.S. District Judge Patricia Seitz said she is considering temporarily blocking the largest cruise corporation in the world from docking its ships at ports in the United States as punishment for a possible probation violation. A final decision will come in a hearing in June.  The [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article229069589.html) reports that Judge Seitz wants company chairman Micky Arison and president Donald Arnold to attend that hearing. 

“The people at the top are treating this as a gnat,” Judge Seitz said. “If I could, I would give all the members of the executive committee a visit to the detention center for a couple of days. It’s amazing how that helps people come to focus on reality.”

Carnival Corp. operates over 100 cruise ships across 10 cruise line brands. Since December 2016, Carnival has been on probation as part of a $40 million settlement for [illegally dumping oil into the ocean from its Princess Cruises ships](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/12/princess-cruises-hit-record-fine-deliberate-pollution-cover/) for at least eight years and lying about the scheme. 

The five-year probation began in April 2017 and requires a third-party auditor to inspect ships belonging to Carnival and its subsidiaries. Despite this, prosecutors say ships have dumped grey water into Alaska’s Glacier Bay National Park, prepared ships in advance of court-ordered audits to avoid unfavorable findings, falsified records and dumped plastic garbage into the ocean.
