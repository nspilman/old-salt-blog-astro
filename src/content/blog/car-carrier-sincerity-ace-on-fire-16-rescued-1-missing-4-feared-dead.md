![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sincerity.jpg)Around 1,800 nautical miles northwest of Oahu, the car carrier *Sincerity Ace* is adrift and on fire. Sixteen of her Philippine crew have been rescued, while four are feared dead and one remains missing. The fire broke on on Monday on the Panamanian flag car carrier operated by Mitsui OSK Lines, traveling from Japan bound for Hawaii. The cause of the fire is still unknown. 

The 665′ long car carrier was in a remote region of the Pacific when the ofre broke out, beyond the range of rescue helicopters.  A US Coast Guard vessel and five merchant vessels responded to the distress call. A US Navy vessel is also in transit to assist in the search for the missing crew member.

[Seatrade](http://www.seatrade-maritime.com/news/americas/search-continues-for-two-missing-from-mol-car-carrier-sincerity-ace-three-feared-dead.html) quotes Lt. Duane Zitta, Coast Guard Joint Rescue Coordination Center Honolulu. “We are thankful for the assistance the crews of these merchant vessels have given us during this event significantly reducing possible response time. Their quick actions provided for the rescue of 16 members of the crew who would otherwise still be in the water and are continuing to aid us.”
