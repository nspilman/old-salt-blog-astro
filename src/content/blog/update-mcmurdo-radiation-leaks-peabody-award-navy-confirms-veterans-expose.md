McMurdo Station

In March of 2011, we [posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/05/nuclear-plant-leak-in-antarctica-suspected-of-causing-cancer/) about reporting done by [Ron Regan](http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/about_us/staff/Chief-Investigator-Ron-Regan-biography) at [NewsChannel5](http://www.newsnet5.com/) in Cleveland, Ohio, concerning radiation leaks at a nuclear power plant at McMurdo Station in Antarctica. There is concern that these radiation leaks are related  to a string of cancers suffered by Navy veterans contracting cancer after serving at the station. (See [Nuclear plant leak in Antarctica suspected of causing cancer](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/05/nuclear-plant-leak-in-antarctica-suspected-of-causing-cancer/).)

Two updates on the story – Yesterday, [Ron Regan received a Peabody Award](http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/investigations/newschannel5s-ron-regan-wins-pebody-journalism-award-for-mcmurdo-navy-station-cancer-investigation) for his reporting on the McMurdo radiation leaks and the cancers suffered by veterans of the base. The [George Foster Peabody Award](http://www.peabody.uga.edu/) is the oldest and most prestigious prize for excellence in electronic media. Our congratulations to Mr. Regan.

As a direct result of Ron Regan’s reporting, Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio called for an official investigation by the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense. These hearing confirmed that Navy veterans were unwittingly exposed to leaking radiation at McMurdo Station, Antarctica.

[Federal hearings confirm Navy veterans exposed to leaking radiation first revealed by NewsChannel5](http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/investigations/Federal-hearings-confirm-Navy-veterans-exposed-to-leaking-radiation-first-revealed-by-NewsChannel5)  
  

*Our exclusive investigation revealed the plant sustained 438 malfunctions and 123 incidents of radiation exposure, prompting Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, to call for an official investigation by the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense.*

*As a result, the Veterans Board on Dose Reconstruction recently concluded public hearings in San Antonio and confirmed that veterans, in fact, had been exposed to repeated doses of radiation for years.*

*A preliminary report by the U.S. Navy describes the exposure as “low level”, but also found that only veterans working inside the plant were actually monitored for exposure.*

Thanks to Phil Leon for passing the news along.
