![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/clipperyacht.jpg)A large wave broke over the 68′ yacht, *Geraldton Western Australia*, one of ten yachts racing in the [Clipper Round the World Race](http://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/), while in the Pacific approximately 400 miles off San Francisco. The wave swept the deck, shearing the steering pedestal, damaging electronics and leaving four sailors with injuries ranging from broken ribs to back injuries.  “*We were racing along in 40-60 knot gusts*,” the boat’s skipper Juan Coetzer said. “*The sea was alive with rage. We were making good speed, sailing with the third reef in the main, surfing at 15 to 20 knots. Then at our watch change, just before the sun came up, a monstrous foaming swell broke over our stern.*”

The [USCG Cutter *Bertholf*](http://www.uscg.mil/pacarea/bertholf/), with rescue helicopters aboard, was dispatched to the stricken yacht. The four injured sailors, who were on deck when the wave hit, are reported to be Jane Hitchens, 50, from Kent, the onboard medic; Nik Brbora, 29, from London; Mark Burkes, 47, from Worcestershire and Max Wilson, 62, a farmer from Queensland, Australia.
