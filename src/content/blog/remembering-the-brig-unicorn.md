Last week, the [brig *Unicorn* sank](http://stluciatimes.com/article/brig-unicorn-sinks) after apparently hitting a submerged object on her way from St. Lucia to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for dry docking. The captain and nine crew escaped by boat and were rescued by the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Coast Guard a few hours later. The brig was built in Finland in 1949 and has been sailing in the St. Lucia charter business for many years. *Unicorn* was also known for appearing in movies and television programs.

The *Unicorn* was often said to have played the ship *[Black Pearl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Pearl)* in the *[Pirates of Caribbean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)* series of movies, which was not the case. Instead, she reportedly played the *Henrietta*. Nevertheless, the brig was employed in three *Pirates* movies. It was also used in the movie, *[Muppet’s Treasure Island](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117110/)* and played a slave ship in the television mini-series [*Roots*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_\(TV_miniseries\)). Here is a clip of the *Unicorn* from *Roots*.  Thanks to Robert Kennedy for contributing to this post.
