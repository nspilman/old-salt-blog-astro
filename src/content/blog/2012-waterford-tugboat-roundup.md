The [20th Annual Great North River Tugboat Race & Competition](http://workingharbor.com/tugrace_home.html) was again a great success. For full and complete coverage check out [Will’s Tugster blog. Great photographs and commentary.](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/nyc-tugboat-race-2012-c/)

For those in the area who still haven’t had your fill of tugboats, you may want to head upriver to Waterford, NY. for  the 2012 [Waterford Tugboat Roundup](http://www.tugboatroundup.com/).   Waterford is 12 miles north of Albany at the junction of the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers, and the junction of the Erie and Champlain Canals. It is the home of the “Waterford Flight”, the highest set of lift locks in the world.  Almost every year since 1999, the town of Waterford and the Waterford Maritime Historical Society has hosted the roundup, attracting tugs from all over the region. Last year the roundup was canceled due to the arrival of Hurricane Irene, but this year it is back and promising to be one of the best ever.  The festivities are held  from Friday to Sunday, September 7th – 9th.
