![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/03/graf_spee_02.jpg)There is an interesting ongoing conflict  over the  salvaging of the German pocket battleship *[Admiral Graf Spee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_pocket_battleship_Admiral_Graf_Spee)* which was scuttled in the River Plate in 1939.   A Uruguayan businessman has been salving parts of the *Graf Spee* for the last ten years but has been blocked from displaying or selling part of the ship by political pressure from the government of Germany.   The German government has called for the salvaged portions of the ship to be displayed in a museum rather than auctioned to the public.  The German government is concerned in particular that a giant bronze eagle with spread wings with a swastika under its talons which had been on the stern of the ship could land in the hands of Nazi-memorabilia fanatics.
