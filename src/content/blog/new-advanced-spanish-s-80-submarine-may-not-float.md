The new [S-80 class submarines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-80-class_submarine) under construction for the Spanish Navy are high-tech wonders with an “[air-independent-propulsion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-independent_propulsion)” system which allows the non-nuclear submarines to operate independently of the surface by using bio-ethanol engines and fuel cells.  It was announced recently, however, that the first submarine of the series has a significant technical short-coming.  Due to increased weight aboard the submarine, it appears unlikely that the submarine has enough buoyancy to dive and resurface. Bottom line: the submarine may not float.  Additional buoyancy could be added by lengthening the 233 ft submarine, but lengthening would cost an estimated 7.5 million euros per added meter. The four submarines had a projected cost of 2.2 billion euros, one of the most expensive contracts in Spain’s military history, but could now be facing a much larger bill.  The design flaw is expected to delay the delivery of the first submarine to the Spanish Navy from 2015 until possibly 2017.  Thanks to Phil Leon for contributing to this post.
