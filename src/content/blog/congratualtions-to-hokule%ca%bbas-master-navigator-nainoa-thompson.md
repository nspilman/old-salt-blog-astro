![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/03/nthompson.jpg)Congratulations to [Nainoa Thompson](http://www.hokulea.com/nainoa-thompson-receives-explorers-medal/) who was honored recently with the 2017 [Explorers Club Medal](https://explorers.org/about/history/the_explorers_club_medal), the most prestigious recognition in exploration. The award was presented to Thompson at the 113th Explorers Club Annual Dinner at Ellis Island in New York City. Thompson was recognized for his historic work to revive and perpetuate Polynesian wayfinding and for leading the [Mālama Honua Worldwide Voyage](http://www.hokulea.com/worldwide-voyage/) as captain and navigator of iconic sailing canoe [*Hōkūleʻa*](http://www.hokulea.com/). Thompson has dedicated his life to teaching the art and values of wayfinding to generations of navigators throughout Polynesia and from across the globe. He was the first Native Hawaiian to practice long-distance wayfinding since the 14th century and consequently inspired a voyaging renaissance throughout the Pacific.

In addition to Thompson, André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard, M.D. received the Explorers Club Medal for Solar Impulse, a solar powered airplane circumnavigation project that has raised public awareness and encouraged political actions in favor of clean technologies and energy efficiency around the world.

Below is an interview with Nainoa Thompson regarding the epic voyage of *Hōkūleʻa* and its larger purpose.
