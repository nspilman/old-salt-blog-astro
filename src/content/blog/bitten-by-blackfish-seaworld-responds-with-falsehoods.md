[Seaworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaWorld) continues to be bitten by the “[Blackfish effect](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2971294/The-Blackfish-effect-SeaWorld-loses-25-4-million-documentary-criticizing-company-s-treatment-killer-whales-lowers-park-attendance.html).”  In October of 2013, CNN aired “Blackfish,” a scathing documentary which looked at the almost 40 year history of orcas in captivity, leading up to the killing of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010 by the 12,000-pound orca, Tilikum, a whale previously associated with the death of two other people.  Since then, SeaWorld has been coping with the [backlash from the documentary](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/12/12/how-seaworld-became-such-an-unpopular-company/). The company has faced boycotts, lawsuits, falling tickets sales and an avalanche of bad press. Seaworld’s stock has fallen by more than half and, in terms of market capitalization, the company has lost roughly 1.7 billion dollars in value.

Recently, SeaWorld has launched a new campaign on television to rebut the claims that they abuse orcas. Unfortunately, the commercial is far less than accurate. Here is the commercial, as critiqued by *[Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/07/seaworld_s_treatment_of_captive_orcas_is_their_new_2015_commercial_telling.html),* providing counterpoint to the claims made by SeaWorld and its staff.
