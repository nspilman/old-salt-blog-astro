From![2013-Nautical-Blog-Hopsmall](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-Nautical-Blog-Hopsmall.jpg) Tuesday, September 17 through Saturday, September 21st, we will participating in “[Weigh Anchor](http://ofhistoryandkings.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/weigh-anchor-nautical-blog-hop.html),” a nautical blog hop organized by the wonderful [Helen Hollick](http://ofhistoryandkings.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/weigh-anchor-nautical-blog-hop.html).  She has brought together twenty three writers of nautical fiction and non-fiction to post about their work and other interesting topics with nautical themes.  If you were unaware that there were  23 authors writing about ships and the sea, here is a great opportunity to meet them.

As my novel “[Hell Around the Horn](http://www.amazon.com/Hell-Around-the-Horn-ebook/dp/B0091614MM/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_t_2_1EE7)” is set on a windjammer, one of the last mighty sailing ships to carry one toward the end of the great age of sail, I will be posting a “*Week of Windjammers*.”  (Technically, it may be only five days but I like the alliteration. And who knows I may add on a few days to make it a full week.)
