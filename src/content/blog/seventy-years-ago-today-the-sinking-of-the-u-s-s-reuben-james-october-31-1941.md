USS Reuben James

The first American Naval ship lost in World War II was not sunk in the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941.  Over a month before, on October 31, 1941, the destroyer *[USS Reuben James](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Reuben_James_\(DD-245\))*, escorting a convoy bound for Britain, was sunk by a torpedo from a German submarine, [U552](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-552) near Iceland.  Of the 159-man crew, only 44 survived.  This was the third attack by German submarines on US destroyers.   On September 1941, the destroyer *[USS Greer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Greer_\(DD-145\))* exchanged fire with a German submarine, but was not hit.  Then, on October 17th, the destroyer *[USS Kearny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Kearny)* was hit by a German torpedo but survived. Eleven crew members were killed and 22 injured in the attack.

The sinking of the Reuben James was memorialized by the American folk singer [Woody Guthrie](http://www.woodyguthrie.org/):
