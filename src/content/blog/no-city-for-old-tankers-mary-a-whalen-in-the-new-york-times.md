There are over five hundred miles of waterfront in New York harbor. The *[Mary A. Whalen](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=mary+a+whalen)* only needs around 200 feet of it to tie up, yet for the last six years, the historic tanker and [PortSide New York](http://portsidenewyork.org/), the non-profit educational organization based on the ship, have been without a permanent home.  The condition has reached a crisis. If a new home for the historic tanker is not found soon, she may she scrapped. [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/nyregion/no-city-for-old-ships-or-oil-tankers.html?pagewanted=all) published a front page article this morning (front page on their web site, and the first page of the Metropolitan section in their print edition) on the struggle to find a home for the *Mary A. Whalen.*  Definately worth reading.

[No City for Old Tankers](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/nyregion/no-city-for-old-ships-or-oil-tankers.html?_r=1&hp)  
  
*Some ships run into icebergs and become 3-D movie extravaganzas; others disappear silently into the abyss of paperwork.*

*Carolina Salguero, 51, bought the 613-ton ship for her nonprofit organization, PortSide NewYork, in 2006 for $16,500, with plans to serve visitors and the companies working in the harbor. She envisioned a future of educational exhibitions and cultural events, as well as weddings and other fund-raising activities. A local opera company staged Puccini’s “Il Tabarro” for large crowds in 2007, but never again.*

*Now the Mary Whalen is homeless, and PortSide is running out of money, unable to afford the $5,000 a month it costs to keep the ship idle. Unless the organization finds a new berth or a stream of cash in the next few weeks, Ms. Salguero said, she will have to disband it and give up the 74-year-old vessel, probably consigning it to the scrap heap.*

*“It’d be a barren and sorrier harbor without the Mary Whalen,” said Roland Lewis, president of the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance, a consortium of organizations working on the shoreline.*

*“It’s a living artifact of New York’s maritime history, as important as a painting in a museum or anything that tells us who we are and how we got here,” Mr. Lewis said. “And you can get inside it, unlike a painting. It’s right in the water where it lived and worked.”*
