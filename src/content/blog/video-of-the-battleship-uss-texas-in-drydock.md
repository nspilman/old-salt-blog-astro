Here are two videos of the 110-year-old battleship USS *Texas* in drydock at the Gulf Copper Shipyard in Galveston.  The *Texas* is the oldest remaining dreadnought battleship and only one of six surviving ships to have served in both World War I and World War II.

The first video is a 25-minute walk around the drydock floor led by [Travis Davis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-davis-82212794/), Vice President of Ship Operations at [Battleship Texas Foundation](https://battleshiptexas.org/). Travis explains the features of the hull as well as areas to be repaired during the current $35 million refurbishment. The video is a unique opportunity to stroll around under the hull of a more than one-hundred-year-old dreadnought without donning a hard hat, and a boiler suit, and without getting your boots wet.

The second video is under 2 minutes of drone footage that captures the entire battleship on the drydock.
