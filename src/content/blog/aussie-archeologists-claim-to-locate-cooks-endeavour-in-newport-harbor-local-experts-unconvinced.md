The question is not so much whether the wreck of Captain Cook’s ship [*Endeavour*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Endeavour) rests at the bottom of the harbor in Newport, RI, but rather which of several wrecks it may be.  The *Endeavour*, renamed *Lord Sandwich* and outfitted as a troop transport, was scuttled in Newport harbor with 12 other ships to attempt to blockade the French fleet in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, in 1778. 

For over twenty years, the [Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project](https://www.rimap.org/) (RIMAP) has been [working to determine which pile of rotting timbers and ballast stones](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/05/process-discovery-cooks-hms-endeavour/) is indeed *Endeavour.*

In February, [Australian National Maritime Museum’s (ANMM) CEO Kevin Sumption claimed  “conclusively”](https://www.sea.museum/about/media/media-releases/media/2022/02/03/02/31/endeavour-identified) that one of the wrecks in Newport Harbour was, in fact, the British explorer’s *Endeavour*. Local archaeologists say “not so fast.”

Following the statement, executive director Dr. Kathy Abbass of RIMAP, said the announcement out of Australia was “[premature](https://au.news.yahoo.com/australia-blasted-announcing-discovery-endeavour-ship-070954568.html)“.

“What we see on the shipwreck site under study is consistent with what might be expected of the *Endeavour*, but there has been no indisputable data found to prove the site is that iconic vessel, and there are many unanswered questions that could overturn such an identification,” Dr. Abbass said.

“Meanwhile, RIMAP recognises the connection between Australian citizens of British descent and the *Endeavour*, but RIMAP’s conclusions will be driven by proper scientific process and not Australian emotions or politics,” Dr. Abbass said.

Of the wreck which ANMM claims to be the *Endeavour*, only about 15 per cent of the ship remains.

The museum cited circumstantial, not definitive, evidence of its claim: the wood, its age, and shape.

“Its timber sizes correspond exactly to what we know about *Endeavour*,” explained Kieran Hosty, the manager of Maritime Archaeology at the ANMM.

He went on to say, “So, we check all those boxes. We’re very open to conversations with Dr. Abbass if she disagrees with our findings.”
