![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/01/accor-1.jpg)[Marine Log](https://www.marinelog.com/passenger/cruiseships/chantiers-de-latlantique-set-to-build-worlds-largest-sailing-vessels/?utm_source=&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=37269) reports that French hospitality giant Accor S.A. has signed a letter of intent with [Chantiers de l’Atlantique](https://www.marinelog.com/?s=%22Chantiers+de+l%27Atlantique%22) covering the construction of two very large luxury sailing cruise ships. The shipbuilder says “the order will be signed within a few weeks” and that the first ship, the *Orient Express Silenseas*, will be delivered in March 2026 and the second on September 1, 2027.

With a length of 220 meters, it is claimed the *Orient Express Silenseas* will be the largest sailing vessel in the world. It will feature 54 suites measuring on average 70-square-meters, and including a monumental 1,415 square-meter presidential suite (including a 530-square meter private terrace). Other amenities will include a marina, two swimming pools including a lap pool, two restaurants, a speakeasy bar and a cabaret bar.

The vessel will feature three of the [SolidSail rigid sails](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/en/solid-sail-20-100-composite-rigid-sail) developed specifically for large vessels by Chantiers de l’Atlantique. As we reported at the time, the SolidSail received Bureau Veritas Approval in Principle last year.

With a surface area of 1,500 square meters each, the SolidSails will be hoisted on [balestron rigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balestron_rig) on three tilting masts reaching more than 100 meters high. They will provide up to 100% of the vessel’s propulsion power in suitable weather conditions. They are part of a hybrid power solution that will combine wind power with a state-of-the-art engine running on liquefied natural gas (LNG), with plans to use green hydrogen, once the technology is approved for ocean passenger ships.

Whether the new ships will be the “largest sailing vessel in the world” is a matter of definition. At 220 meters in length, they will likely be the longest sailing vessels in the world but in terms of sail area, at 4,350 square meters, will still be smaller than the [*Royal Clipper*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Clipper) and the [*Golden Horizon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Clipper) cruise ships with sail areas of 5,200 square meters and 6,300 square meters, respectively.
