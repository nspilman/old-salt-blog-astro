RCCL Allure of the Seas

On Friday morning, a [British passenger was seen falling overboard](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16883382)  fell from the balcony of his cruise ship cabin on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship,  the *[Allure of the Seas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Allure_of_the_Seas)*, while cruising off the coast of Mexico, near the island of Cozumel.  The *[Allure of the Seas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Allure_of_the_Seas)* with a capacity of 5,400 passengers is currently the largest cruise ship in the world.  The passenger, a 30 year old man, is still missing, despite ongoing searches by the Mexican Navy and Coast Guard.  This has been the third recorded case of passengers or crew  lost overboard on cruise ships this year and the second incident on a  Royal Caribbean ship. In 2011, [23 people were reported to have been lost overboard](http://www.cruisejunkie.com/Overboard.html) on cruise ships and ferries. Since 2000, 176 are reported to have been lost. Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing on the news.
