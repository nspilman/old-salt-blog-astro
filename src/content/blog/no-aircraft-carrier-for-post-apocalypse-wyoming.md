![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wyoming-rocky-mountains.jpg)This is not really a nautical story, which is why it is amusing. [The Billings Gazette reports](http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/wyoming/wyoming-doomsday-bill-moves-forward-minus-aircraft-carrier/article_ec3bb539-ff92-5fc4-9dac-53e0279daa4f.html) that “the Wyoming House of Representatives on Monday advanced legislation to launch a study into what Wyoming should do in the event of a complete economic or political collapse in the United States. Before passing House Bill 85 by a voice vote on second reading, lawmakers struck out language directing the task force to study Wyoming acquiring strike aircraft and an **aircraft carrier**.” (Emphasis added.)  
  
Wyoming is the least populated state in the nation with a population of under 600,000 people. It is also wholly landlocked, being 2/3 mountainous and 1/3 high plains. The nearest ocean, the Pacific, is 800 miles away and the state on average is about 6,700 feet above sea level.

Contingency planning is fine, but I am glad they cut the aircraft carrier.
