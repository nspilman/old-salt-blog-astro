We are learning more about the hijacked SV Quest, seized by pirates off Oman last Friday.   The sailing yacht, reportedly with Americans Scott and Jean Adam, Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle aboard, had been sailing with the Oz-Med section of the [Blue Water Rally](http://www.yachtrallies.co.uk/).   The Blue Water Rallies are groups of cruising boas which travel together around the world for mutual support.    From the [Blue Water Rally website](http://www.yachtrallies.co.uk/index.php/blue-water-rally/295-s-v-quest.html):  
  
*The Blue Water Rally is very distressed to learn of the hijacking of SV Quest on 18th February. Scott and Jean Adam joined the Oz-Med section of the Blue Water Rally just before Christmas and had been sailing with the rally from Phuket as far as Mumbai. Quest had taken on board two well known rally participants: Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle. However, Quest chose to take an independent route from Mumbai to Salalah, leaving the Rally on 15 February.*

CNN is reporting that a US Navy warship is trailing the hijacked yacht.

*A U.S. Navy warship and helicopters are trailing a boat believed to be the one that was hijacked by Somali pirates over the weekend, a senior military source with knowledge of the operation told CNN. Four Americans were manning the boat.*

*Pirates boarded the American yacht off the coast of Oman last Friday, three days after the boat’s owners split off from the relative safety of a sailing group traversing a dangerous section of the Indian Ocean, according to the group, the Blue Water Rally.*
