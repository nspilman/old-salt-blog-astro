Having just gotten back from warmer climes, I am still adjusting to the temperatures around 20 degrees F, with wind chills in the teens here on the banks of the Hudson River.  I have come across a new video from the [Maine Windjammer Association.](http://www.sailmainecoast.com/)  They introduce the video as follows: “*Best way to take the chill off a cold winter’s day? Check out our brand new 1:30-minute video that’s filled with warmth and sunshine! Enjoy!*”   Personally, a cup of hot coffee and a thick wool sweater helps me fight the chill. Nevertheless, it is a fine video of fine sailing vessels.
