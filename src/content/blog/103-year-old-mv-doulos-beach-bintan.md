![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mvdoulos.jpg)[MV *Doulos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Doulos_Phos) once held the title of the oldest operating passenger liner. Now 103 years old, the historic ship may be close to beginning a new life as a shoreside hotel in the resort town of Bintan, Indonesia. 

When the refurbished ship will open as a hotel is unclear. Reports from 2016 said that the newly named Doulos Phos The Hotel would open by early 2017. The project has been delayed, however.

Back in 2010, we [posted about how MV *Doulos* was saved](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/03/at-95-years-old-newport-news-built-mv-doulos-again-avoids-scrapyard/) from the scrap yard by Eric Saw, a Singaporean investor, who had intended to convert the ship to a floating multi-use facility in Singapore. When these plans fell through the ship was towed to Batam, Indonesia, to be refurbished before moving to the island of Bintan to become part of a US$25 million hotel resort. Following drydocking, the ship was hauled ashore on a spit of land adjacent to the Bandar Bentan Telani Ferry Terminal.

[The Straits Times](http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/102-year-old-ship-being-turned-into-bintan-hotel) reports that the offically renamed Doulos Phos The Hotel will retain “*pieces of its maritime history such as its engine room and bridge, which contains a century- old compass, and will be turned into a museum.  Its old wash basins will find new homes in the hotel’s toilets, while frames of bunk beds will be turned into day beds in guestrooms.*

*“On the captain’s deck will be the presidential suite – a cabin more than 1,000 sq ft in size boasting a private jacuzzi and barbecue pit. Its eight decks will be furnished to reflect different periods in the ship’s colourful history.*”

MV *Doulos* was built in the United States at Newport News Shipbuilding in 1914 as the SS *Medina*, a general cargo ship with passenger accommodations for the Mallory Steamship Company. SS *Medina* was initially used for transporting onions from East Texas to her home port, New York City. The ship served in both World Wars as a supply ship. 

She was converted to a passenger ship in 1949 and purchased by Costa Lines in 1952. Converted to a motor ship, she sailed for Costa Lines as the MS *Franca C*  between 1953 and 1977. 

In 1978 she was purchased by a German Christian charity, Gute Bücher für Alle (English: Good Books for All), renamed MV *Doulos* and was used as a globe-circling bookstore.
