Explosion on Blind Date? More questions than answers

A very odd news report from this afternoon. At around 4:20 PM, a yacht identified as the *Blind Date* is reported to have exploded with 21 people aboard in the Atlantic, about 17.5 miles off [Sandy Hook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook), New Jersey, according to [NBC New York.](http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Sandy-Hook-Yacht-Accident-Explosion-158484725.html)  The people aboard are said to have taken to life rafts.  Coast Guard helicopters and rescue boats were dispatched.  The Coast Guard is reporting that 7 people are injured while other sources are reporting 9 burn injuries.

Over two hours after the explosion was reported, neither the Coast Guard nor private boats in the area have located any life rafts or debris from the reported explosion according to reporting by the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coast-guard-yacht-with-21-people-aboard-explodes-off-central-nj-injuries-reported/2012/06/11/gJQAxKDfVV_story.html).

The [U.S. Coast Guard says a report of the explosion could be a hoax](http://newsok.com/coast-guard-nj-yacht-explosion-possibly-a-hoax/article/feed/392663?custom_click=pod_headline_usnational-news) because it can’t find any signs of distress in the water.

The yacht in the reports is believed to be the [160′ motor yacht built by Trinity Yachts in 2009](http://www.charterworld.com/index.html?sub=yacht-charter&charter=myblind-date-2481) named *[Blind Date](http://www.superyachttimes.com/editorial/21/article/id/5750)* but there has been no confirmation of this either.
