*Six of the seven men made pre-trial agreements that resulted in some charges being dropped. Other current and former crew members aboard the St. Petersburg, Fla.-based cutter Venturous were also administratively disciplined for their roles.*

*One of the men was convicted of crimes including abusive sexual contact, and he will be required to register as a sex offender.*

*Coast Guard Atlantic Area spokesman Jamie Frederick said the hazing included crew members being “tied down, stripped and coated in foreign substances.” The hazing occurred in the berthing areas of the ship between summer 2007 and winter 2009. Frederick did not elaborate on details of the hazing and said it would be impossible to know exactly how many people were hazed over the course of two years.*

*The ship has a crew of about 75, and the investigation began after two former crew members reported what was happening.*

*“The Coast Guard does not tolerate hazing of any kind,” Vice Adm. Robert C. Parker, commander of Coast Guard Atlantic Area, said in a statement. “Even the most junior Coast Guard member has the power, right and obligation to say ‘no’ to hazing.”*

*Frederick said the hazing occurred only while the ship was out to sea.*
