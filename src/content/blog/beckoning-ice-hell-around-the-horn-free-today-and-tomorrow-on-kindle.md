Joan’s detective, Wiki Coffin, is a half-Maori, half-Yankee “linguister,” who is also the representative of American law and order with the U.S. Exploring Expedition fleet in 1839. Against the backdrop of the treacherous Southern Ocean, Wiki is called upon to solve the murder of a young naval lieutenant, while avoiding the increasingly determined attempts on his own life.  A great mystery.
