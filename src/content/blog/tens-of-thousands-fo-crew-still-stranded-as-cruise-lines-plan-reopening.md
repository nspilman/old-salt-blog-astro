![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carnival-restart.jpg)The [major cruise lines have announced plans to restart](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20200508/coronavirus-florida-cruise-lines-plan-restart-but-cdc-has-not-lifted-no-sail-order) at least some of their cruise operations in upcoming months, while tens of thousands of crew are still stranded aboard cruise ships.

Carnival, the world’s largest cruise line, has announced cruises beginning on August 1. Norwegian Cruise Lines has said it plans to restart on July 1, while Royal Caribbean has an even earlier date of June 15. It is unclear from where these earlier cruises may operate as the [CDC’s current no-sail order](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0409-modifications-extension-no-sail-ships.html) does not expire until July 24. 

There are, however, still tens of thousands of cruise ship crew members stranded on over 100 ships in various ports or anchored just offshore. As of the beginning of the month, estimates put the [number of stranded crew at around 100,000](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/no-end-in-sight-100000-crew-on-cruise-ships-stranded-at-sea-coronavirus). The numbers are coming down, but slowly. As of last Friday, the [US Coast Guard estimates that around 70,000 crew](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/cruise-ship-crew-members-stuck-on-board/507-8a7a217a-8450-4daf-9011-96070f3705bb) are still stuck aboard. 

Part of the delay in repatriating the crews have been tighter rules in the US and various countries regarding the terms of disembarkation. The new [more restrictive CDC rules](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/05/09/cruise-ships-amid-coronavirus-crews-stuck-board-beg-go-home/3102135001/) effectively ban the use of public transportation, requiring charter flights and private vehicles to bring crew home. Once they arrive home, crew are required to self-quarantine for 14 days. One sticking point in the new rules is that cruise line executives are required to sign a form attesting that if any of the rules are broken, they are [subject to criminal penalties, including jail time](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/05/09/cruise-ships-amid-coronavirus-crews-stuck-board-beg-go-home/3102135001/).

Assuming that the current crew will be repatriated and that new crew will arrive to operate the new ships, will paying passengers want to return to the ships? Based on Carnival’s recent experience, the answer may be yes. Following the announcement of restarting cruises on August 1, its [bookings jumped by 600%](https://www.tmz.com/2020/05/09/carnival-bookings-spike-increase-cruises-resuming-august/), compared to the previous three days.  Compared to the same period last years, bookings were 200% higher. 

One thing that may explain the surge in demand is simply rock-bottom pricing offered by Carnival on certain August cruises. [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2020/05/04/carnival-cruise-budget-travelers-coronavirus-deals/) reports that as of Monday, the company was offering five-day cruises from Galveston to Cozumel, Mexico, in early August starting at $139, plus taxes, fees, and port expenses. The base rate comes to about $28-a-day including food, cheaper than staying home for many people.

These cruises are not, however, guaranteed.  [Carnival stated in a recent tweet](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20200508/coronavirus-florida-cruise-lines-plan-restart-but-cdc-has-not-lifted-no-sail-order): “Any resumption of cruise operations — whenever that may be — is fully dependent on our continued efforts in cooperation with federal, state, local and international government officials.”
