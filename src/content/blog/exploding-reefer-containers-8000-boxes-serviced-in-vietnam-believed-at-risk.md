Two workers in Vietnam and one in Brazil have died recently in explosions of refrigerated containers.  Faulty coolant is believed to have caused the explosions.  The containers were among an estimated 8,000 reefer boxes serviced in 2011 in Vietnam. The explosions have caused worldwide concern and have disrupted cargo operations on the US West coast.  [Longshoremen at Seattle, WA’s Harbor Island terminal are refusing to handle reefer containers.](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/komo/article/Potentially-explosive-containers-disrupt-Seattle-2249749.php)   Likewise, longshoremen at the port of Oakland, CA have refused to work on vessels calling at the TraPac and SSA Marine terminals after concerns that refrigerated containers could explode.  So far no explosions or injuries have been reported at US ports.  The concern with the reefer containers serviced in Vietnam is that local workers used adulterated coolant in recharging the containers.   Thanks to Irwin Bryan for passing the story along.

The fear of exploding containers may be the least of the Port of Oakland’s problems. Yesterday Occupy Wall Street protesters shut down the port, the fifth-busiest port in the nation.
