![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/belugawedding.jpg)We recently [posted about a penguin on a “field trip”](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/04/penguin-on-field-trip-meets-beluga-whales/) interacting with a beluga whale at Chicago’s [Shedd Aquarium](https://www.sheddaquarium.org/). The post brought to mind a story from years ago about a young couple, Kim & Kevin, who decided to get married at the [Mystic Aquarium](https://www.mysticaquarium.org/), in Mystic, Connecticut. They decided that the service would be held directly in front of the beluga tank. As entertainment, they hired a mariachi band, “[Los Trovadores de America](http://www.mariachiconnecticut.com/).”  

It seems that a beluga named Juna became very interested in the mariachi band and began to move along with the music. Someone caught it on video (of course), and put it up on Youtube. Juna being serenaded by the mariachis has become a minor internet sensation getting almost 6 million views, so far. The video is after the page break.

One equally strange video is that of the service itself, also below, in which Juna appears to be looking over the minister’s shoulder as he performs the wedding. 

Today happens to be my wedding anniversary. We were married without whales or mariachis, but as this is our 34th anniversary, we have managed just fine so far.  I hope that Kim & Kevin are also doing well.
