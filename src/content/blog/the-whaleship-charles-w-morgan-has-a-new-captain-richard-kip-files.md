In September [we posted about the search for a new captain](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/09/captain-wanted-for-172-year-old-whaling-ship-charles-w-morgan-no-captain-ahabs-need-apply/) for the historic whaleship [*Charles W. Morgan*](http://www.mysticseaport.org/visit/explore/morgan/).  The whaler, which recently underwent a major reconstruction, first sailed in 1841 and is scheduled to sail again on a three month voyage next summer. The [Mystic Seaport Museum](http://www.mysticseaport.org/) announced today that Richard “Kip” Files of Rockland, Maine, has been appointed as the captain for her 38th voyage.

[THE NEW CAPTAIN](http://www.mysticseaport.org/news/2013/the-new-captain/)

*“This is an extraordinary undertaking and it will be exciting to take this ship back to sea to discover and share what it was like to operate a wooden whaleship as they did throughout the 19th century,” Files said.*

*As the owner and captain of the 132-foot, three-masted schooner Victory Chimes out of Rockland, Files is no stranger to sailing large ships with no engine. He is also the primary captain of the 207-foot barque Elissa, owned and operated by the Galveston Historical Foundation and Texas Seaport Museum. Files holds a U.S. Coast Guard Master Ocean License for Inspected Passenger Vessels of up to 1,600 Gross Tons and he has been a master of traditional sailing vessels since 1978.*

*Files also served on the boards of Tall Ships America (formerly the American Sail Training Association) and the Ocean Classroom Foundation.* 

*“There are very few people in the world with the knowledge and experience of traditional square-rigged sailing necessary to do this job. Kip is one of those people and we are confident we have found the right person to lead the ship on her 38th Voyage,” said Steve White, president of Mystic Seaport.*
