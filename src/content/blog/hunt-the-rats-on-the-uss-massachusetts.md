Rodents have always been a problem on ships, but things seem to be getting out of control.   Last week we posted (somewhat  facetiously) of a rodent problem on the [Tall Ship Elissa after a rather large mouse named Minnie stopped by for a visit](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/04/06/tall-ship-elissa-in-space-and-possible-rodent-problem/).  Now we hear of rats aboard the [USS Massachusetts in Battleship Cove](http://www.battleshipcove.com/).  (The rats are far fluffier and cuter than the wharf rats in these parts.)

Next week, April 16-24, during spring break for many school kids, Battleship Cove is hosting  “Hunt the Rats” on USS MASSACHUSETTS.  From their [website](http://www.battleshipcove.com/):   *Ten adorable fluffy rats, disguised as members of the ship’s crew, have snuck on board and hidden themselves around the ship so it’ll take all your rat-hunting skills to find them all. Discover where the mischievous rodents have escaped to and be entered into a prize drawing. Great fun for the entire family!* A video of the press conference announcing the hunt:

*“The Rats Have Escaped” Check this out! This press conference asks the question — Can you smell a rat? Seriously. Escaped rats are hiding on board the USS Massachusetts. News of the escape has spread like wildfire and reporters like Whiskers McGee and Joe Rosentail from “Rat Race News” demand to know how this happened and what is being done. www.battleshipcove.org*

*“The Rats Have Escaped” is a short film by Professor Ricardo D. Rebelo and his students at Bristol Community College, Fall River, Massachusetts, Department of Television Services. The film features Brad King, Executive Director of Battleship Cove, in Fall River, Massachusetts. BCC students appear as journalists. The rats are portrayed by themselves.*
