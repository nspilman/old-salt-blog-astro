We should probably add a new category to the blog, something along the lines of  “You Can’t Make This Stuff Up.”  This post would certainly fit. The [Norwegian Seafood Council](http://en.seafood.no/) has sponsored [Human Sushi](http://www.godfisk.no/Artikler/Norge/Human-sushi/The-Human-Sushi), a series of  dances to interpret sushi and sashimi recipes.  From their website:

*The Human Sushi is a performance group that interprets sushi recipes in their own way. This cheerful gang is led by Arthur, an energetic Norwegian speaking Frenchman. Together they dance until both maki, nigiri and sashimi. Which dance performance do you like best?*
