Manfred Fritz Bajorat

Day before yesterday, [we posted about the body of Manfred Fritz Bajorat](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/03/mummified-corpse-of-german-sailor-found-on-drifting-yacht/), 59, a German sailor, who had been found adrift on his yacht off the Philippines. The body was a dusty grey in color and the sailor was widely reported to have been “mummified.” We were not quite as convinced, so we referred to the remains as “at least partially mummified in the heat and salt air.” Even that proved to be an exaggeration. Likewise early reports said that the sailor has not been seen in seven years. Another report said that the sailor had posted on Facebook a year ago. So how long ago did Bajorat die and what killed him? [An autopsy has revealed that Bajorat had only been dead for about a week](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/philippines-mummified-german-sailor-manfred-fritz-bajorat-had-only-been-dead-week-1547315) when his body was found and that he had died of a heart attack. [Click here for a photograph of the corpse](https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1494502/mummified-german.jpg?w=615). (May be disturbing to some.)
