![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kirsten-Neuschafer.jpg)Congratulations to [Kirsten Neuschäfer](https://goldengloberace.com/skippers/kirsten-neuschafer/), winner of the [2022 Golden Globe Race](https://goldengloberace.com/). After 235 days at sea, the 39-year-old South African sailor crossed the finish line off Les Sables d’Olonne in France at 9pm CEST on Thursday, becoming the first woman to win a solo, round-the-world yacht race.

The race is based on the [1968-69 Sunday Times Golden Globe Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Times_Golden_Globe_Race) which saw Sir Robin Knox-Johnston become the first person to circumnavigate the globe, sailing solo on his boat *Suhaili* without stopping.

Sailors in the race sail solo, non-stop, in yachts designed before 1988 without electronic instruments or autopilots.

As one of 16 competitors to start the race, Neuschäfer was the only female. By the time she crossed the finish line, only two other sailors were on course to complete the race without stopping. 

Neuschäfer had no idea she was leading throughout much of the race.  She was tired but jubilant as she celebrated a hard-fought victory. Once crossing the finish line, her Cape George 36 cutter, *Minnehaha* was towed up the channel to the pontoon as thousands of people cheered and applauded her incredible achievement.

“I feel very emotional and honored,” said Neuschäfer after finishing the race. “I am never going to forget the welcome. I want to thank my fellow skippers as without them, there would have been no race.”
