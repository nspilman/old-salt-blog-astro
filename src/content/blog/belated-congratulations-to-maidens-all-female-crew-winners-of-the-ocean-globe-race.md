Still catching-up on interesting nautical news that transpired while I away. We would be remiss to not offer our belated congratulations to [Skipper Heather Thomas and the crew of the yacht *Maiden*](https://oceangloberace.com/maiden-wins-mcintyre-ocean-globe/), who beat 14 other teams to win the [Ocean Globe Race](https://oceangloberace.com/) on IRC handicap, becoming the first ever all-women crew to win an around-the-world yacht race.

The former Whitbread yacht, sailed by an international crew took the title after 153d 2h 16m 53s of racing around the world. Virtually none of the crew had previously faced such an epic challenge and only one had sailed in the Southern Ocean before.

‘It’s very exciting to be the first all-female crew to win an around-the-world race. It’s a historic moment,’ said *Maiden* skipper Heather Thomas, as reported by [Yachting Monthly](https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/uncategorized/maiden-wins-the-ocean-globe-race-97523). ‘The girls have worked really hard for it and we’re very proud of our achievement. We have the best crew and the best boat so what can I say!’

Ocean Globe Race founder Don McIntyre added: ‘What an absolutely stunning victory for skipper Heather and this eclectic mix of international girls and skills onboard *Maiden*. Wow!

‘They have embraced this OGR adventure at every level, performing on the water, facing completely unknown Southern Ocean challenges with courage and determination and representing their cause like real champions.’

*[Maiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_\(yacht\))* is a 58 foot (18 m) aluminium ocean racing yacht built in 1979, designed by Bruce Farr and raced by Pierre Fehlmann, Bertie Reed, [Tracy Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Edwards) and John Bankart. Edwards bought the yacht in 1987 to compete in the 1989–90 Whitbread Round the World Race with an all-female crew. The yacht achieved good results and broke records, leading to Edwards becoming the first female winner of the Yachtsman of the Year Trophy, changing the perception of women in ocean racing.

In 2018, a [documentary titled *Maiden* was made](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/06/documentary-maiden-first-all-female-team-to-race-around-the-world/) about Edwards and her crew competing in the Whitbread race.
