The 4,380 TEU container ship  [*Amsterdam Bridge*](http://www.tuh.de/mv_marburg.html) caught fire on a voyage between Mumbai to Colombo. The ship returned to Mumbai and is now at an outer anchorage.  Recent reports suggests that the fire is contained if not necessarily completely extinguished. [VesselTracker.com](http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Amsterdam-Bridge-9450911.html) is reporting that Coast Guard officials suspect that the fire erupted in the engine room of the vessel.  Other sources say that the fire spread to the mid portion of the ship, which is said to be carrying approximately 112 containers loaded with hazardous cargoes.   No injuries have been recorded.  Thanks to Phil Leon for passing along the news. (Note: the original post misstated the container capacity of the ship. Thanks to Terra for pointing out the error.)
