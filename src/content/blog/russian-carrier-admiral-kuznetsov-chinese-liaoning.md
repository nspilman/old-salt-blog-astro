CNS Liaoning

The Russians and the Chinese each have only one aircraft carrier in service. They happen to be sister ships and both have major problems in staying afloat and keeping the propellers turning.  Both ships were built in the [Black Sea Shipyard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Shipyard "Black Sea Shipyard") in [Mykolaiv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykolaiv "Mykolaiv"), [Ukraine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine").

Russia’s only operational aircraft carrier, [*Admiral Kuznetsov*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_aircraft_carrier_Admiral_Kuznetsov), dating back to the Soviet Union, was ordered in 1981 and went into full service in 1995.  The ship has had significant operating problems. There were reports that in 2011 that the [U.S. Navy’s Sixth Fleet kept close by in case the *Admiral Kuznetsov* happened to sink.](https://medium.com/war-is-boring/u-s-navy-feared-crappy-russian-aircraft-carrier-might-sink-c4ed4afff987)  The carrier made it back to her home port and has recently undergone a refit.

China also has one aircraft carrier, [*Liaoning*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_aircraft_carrier_Liaoning), which is also beset with problems. The Chinese purchased the unfinished ex-Soviet carrier, *Varyag,* in 1989.  The *Liaoning* happens to be a sister vessel to *Admiral Kuznetsov,* though was never delivered due to the collapse of the Soviet union.  The *Liaoning* was commissioned two years ago but is still undergoing sea trials and [reportedly has suffered significant mechanical failures.](https://medium.com/war-is-boring/chinas-aircraft-carrier-trouble-spewing-steam-and-losing-power-29dae6cd9fdf)   Even the China daily is admitting that “[more time is needed to hone \[*Liaoning’s*\] combat readiness](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/09/26/china-new-carrier-needs-time-to-be-combat-ready.html).”

*Admiral Kuznetsov* and *Liaoning* are each roughly half the size of a [US Navy *Nimitz* class aircraft carrier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier), of which the US has ten.  According to [globalsecurity.org](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/carriers.htm), the US Navy has over twice as many aircraft carriers as the rest of the world combined, measured both by the number of ships and aircraft deck space.
