![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/maryrose.jpg)Depending on how you look at it, there is either good or bad news about the *[Mary Rose](http://www.maryrose.org/)*.  The *Mary Rose* is the only only 16th century warship on display anywhere in the world. She was one of the first ships able to fire a broadside, and was a favorite of King Henry VIII.

The bad news is that her exhibit in Portsmouth is closing for three years.   The good news is that a new 35 million pound museum is being built to house her in the manner she so richly deserves.

*This weekend was the public’s last chance to view the vessel historian Dr David Starkey described as “this country’s Pompeii”, before construction work begins on a new £35m purpose-built museum.*

*The modernistic centre, which will receive £21m from the Heritage Lottery Fund, will proudly display the Tudor warship close to Nelson’s flagship, the Victory.*

*It has been called one of the most ambitious and significant heritage projects in recent years.*

*Currently the ancient hull of the Mary Rose is constantly sprayed with a water-based wax solution to prevent the timbers drying out and rotting away.*

*Eventually this process will end, and by 2011 a long and complex programme will begin to “dry out” her ancient beams and ensure they are preserved forever. But the real change will be her setting.*

*The new museum complex will enable the public to “engage” with the ship in a way that is impossible in her current hall.*
