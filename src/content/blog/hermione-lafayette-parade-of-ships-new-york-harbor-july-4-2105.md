On a nearly windless, overcast and rainy morning, the French replica frigate *[l’Hermione](http://www.hermione2015.com/)* led an impressive flotilla of every sort of craft from very large yachts to jet skis, from below the Verazzano Narrow’s Bridge through the inner harbor and up the North River. Here is a video I shot and edited of the parade.  I was a passenger on the lovely schooner [Shearwater](https://www.manhattanbysail.com/sails/sails-by-vessel/Shearwater/1/).
