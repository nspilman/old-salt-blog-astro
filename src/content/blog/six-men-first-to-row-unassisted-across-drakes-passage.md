![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ohana.jpg)Six men have become the first to [row unassisted across Drake’s passage](https://www.discovery.com/shows/the-impossible-row/articles/the-impossible-row-reaches-antarctica), between South America and Antarctica. The effort was led by adventurer [Colin O’Brady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_O%27Brady). In just under 13 days, they rowed more than 700 miles in a 29-foot boat named Ohana.

The [other men on the expedition](https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/men-1st-cross-perilous-drake-passage-unassisted-67958069) were: Fiann Paul of Reykjavik, Iceland; Cameron Bellamy of Cape Town, South Africa; Andrew Towne of Grand Forks, North Dakota; and John Petersen of Oakland, California.

Paul, Douglas-Hamilton and Bellamy are record-breaking ocean rowers, Towne is a championship rower and has climbed the tallest mountain on every continent, and Petersen was a championship college rower.

O’Brady is an American professional endurance athlete and a former professional triathlete. On December 26, 2018, he became the first person to cross the landmass of Antarctica, solo and unsupported.

The project was supported by the [Discovery Channel](https://www.discovery.com/shows/the-impossible-row/articles/the-impossible-row-reaches-antarctica) which documented the voyage in real-time while following *Ohana* in a support vessel.
