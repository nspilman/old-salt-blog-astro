Timbers from HMS Namur

On Thursday, the [Chatham Historic Dockyard](http://thedockyard.co.uk/) opened its new exhibit “[Command of the Oceans](http://thedockyard.co.uk/explore/command-of-the-ocean/)” to the public. The [centerpiece of the display are timbers](http://www.kentonline.co.uk/whats-on/news/a-life-on-the-ocean-wave-command-of-the-oceans-at-chatham-historic-dockyard-96400/) from the 90-gun second-rate ship of the line, [HMS *Namur*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Namur_\(1756\)).  The ship was built in the Chatham dockyard in 1756 and perhaps more importantly, also scrapped in the dockyard in 1833. At some point, some of her timbers were covered by the floorboards of a wheelwright’s workshop. In 1995, roughly 10% of the timbers of a ship were found beneath six layers of floorboards. After more than a decade of investigation, the [frames were identified in 2012](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/08/timbers-from-jane-austens-brothers-ship-hms-namur-found-under-floorboards-at-chatham-historic-dockyard/) as belonging to HMS *Namur.*  The discovery of the timbers from the Namur is described on the dockyard website as “the single most important warship discovery in Northern Europe since that of the *MARY ROSE.”*

In 47 years of service, HMS *Namur* saw action in three major wars, including the Seven Years’ War and Napoleonic Wars, and nine fleet actions.  Among her notable captains was [Charles Austen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Austen), who commanded the ship from 1811 to 1814.  Charles, who rose to the rank of rear admiral, was the younger brother of author [Jane Austen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen). Charles’ elder brother, [Sir Francis Austen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Austen), also joined the navy and eventually rose to be Admiral of the Fleet.
