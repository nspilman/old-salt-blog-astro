SV Quest reported hijacked by pirates

Four Americans on the [S/V *Quest*](http://www.svquest.com/) were seized by pirates this afternoon 240 nautical miles off the coast of Oman in the Indian Ocean.   [Jean and Scott Adam](http://www.svquest.com/MeetTheCrew.htm), owners of the S/V *Quest*, have been sailing around the world for more than seven years.  With their two crew, they will join the over 815 sailors now being held hostage by pirates.

The range of pirate activities now stretched from the Horn of Africa across the Indian Ocean and into the Arabian Sea.  Last week, the Panama-flagged ship *Yuan Xiang* was hijacked with 29 Chinese sailors aboard in the Arabian Sea, while on Wednesday the [International Maritime Bureau’s Piracy Reporting Centre reported](http://www.maritimeprofessional.com/Blogs/Maritime-Transportation-Security-News-and-Views/February-2011/Brazen-Somali-Pirates-Operating-Almost-Within-Sigh.aspx) of pirate operating operating less than 30 miles off the coast of India.

Piracy continues to be a high reward,  relatively low risk endeavor.  Last year of the 400 pirates captured by EUNAVFOR, the multi-national naval task force, most were simply released.   Only 15 were held to stand trial.
