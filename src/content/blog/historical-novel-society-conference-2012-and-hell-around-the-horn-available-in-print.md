There are writers who I feel that I know well and consider to be friends, and yet that I have never met in person.  This evening, I will be leaving to attend the [Historical Novel Society Conference](http://www.hns-conference.org.uk/) in London and am looking forward to meeting many of the writers with whom who I have been conversing on-line, in some cases for years, but have never met in the flesh.  I will also be participating in the “[Ship’s Ahoy” Workshop](http://www.hns-conference.org.uk/workshops-talks/) with [Linda Collison](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/08/30/linda-collisions-barbados-bound-a-review/), [JD Davies](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/13/gentleman-captain-by-j-d-davies-a-review/), [Helen Hollick](http://www.helenhollick.net/), and [Margaret Muir](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/21/floating-gold-by-margaret-muir-a-review-2/).  Should be great fun.
