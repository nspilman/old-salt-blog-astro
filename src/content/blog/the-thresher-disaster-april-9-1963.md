Fifty years ago today, the nuclear submarine *[USS Thresher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Thresher_\(SSN-593\))* [(SSN-593)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Thresher_\(SSN-593\)) sank during deep  diving tests in the Atlantic off Massachusetts with a loss of 129 officers, crewmen, and military and civilian technicians.  The sinking of the submarine is considered to be a watershed event in the implementation of the rigorous US Navy submarine safety program [SUBSAFE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUBSAFE).  The folk sinker [Tom Paxton](http://www.tompaxton.com/) wrote a song about the tragedy, sung here on Youtube by [threelegsoman](http://www.youtube.com/user/threelegsoman?feature=watch).
