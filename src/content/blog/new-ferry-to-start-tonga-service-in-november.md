Olovaha

Early last August the Tongan ferry, Princess Ashika, sank with a presumed loss over seventy lives.  See our previous posts  – [Princess Akisha](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/index.php?s=+Princess+Ashika).   A [new ferry, the Olovaha, for the route is being built in Japan](http://www.matangitonga.to/article/tonganews/outerislands/20100302_tonga_olovaha_interislandferry.shtml), with Japanese funding and is expected to go into service in November.  Until them [New Zealand has donated a 45.5m flat-bottomed barge](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10629799) for use as a temporary inter-island ferry.   The barge ferry service is to start from the first week of April and operate until the arrival of the new ferry from Japan.
