Here is a short video by Sean and James McAnulty, narrated by Rex Mathieson, telling of his family history with the wreck of the full rigged sailing ship [*Antares*](http://www.flagstaffhill.com/media/uploads/Wrecks-Antares.pdf), which came ashore in 1914 on Victoria, Australia’s “[Shipwreck Coast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck_Coast).”

[The story of the Antares](http://vimeo.com/95398639) from [sean](http://vimeo.com/user17699981) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck_Coast): *The Shipwreck Coast of [Victoria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_\(Australia\) "Victoria (Australia)"), [Australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia") stretches from to Cape Otway to Port Fairy, a distance of approximately 130 km. This coastline is accessible via the [Great Ocean Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Ocean_Road "Great Ocean Road"), and is home to the [limestone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") formations called [The Twelve Apostles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Apostles,_Victoria "The Twelve Apostles, Victoria").*

*Explorer [Matthew Flinders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Flinders "Matthew Flinders") said of the Shipwreck Coast, “I have seldom seen a more fearful section of coastline.”*

*There are approximately 638 known shipwrecks along Victoria’s coast,although only around 240 of them have been discovered. The Historic Shipwreck Trail along the Shipwreck Coast and the Discovery Coast shows some of the sites where gales, human error and, in some cases, foul play caused these vessels to be wrecked.*

Australia has established the [Historic Shipwreck Trail](http://www.flagstaffhill.com/media/uploads/ShipwreckTrail.pdf) on Victoria’s West Coast.
