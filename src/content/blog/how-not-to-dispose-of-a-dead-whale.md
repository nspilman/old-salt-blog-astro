So what do you do if you find a dead gray whale on your beach? It is too large to bury, too heavy to drag away and too stinky to cut into pieces. I am not sure that I have the answer but I can say what not to do. Don’t pack it with dynamite and try to blow it up. The video clip below dates back to 1970 when a dead gray whale washed up on a beach in Florence, Washington. The highway department tried to blow up the whale with a half ton of dynamite. It seemed like a good idea at the time. It wasn’t.
