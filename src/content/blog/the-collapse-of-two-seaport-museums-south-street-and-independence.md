Sadly that is not the case. [Last month we posted about the Independence Seaport Museum](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/08/new-owner-sought-for-cruiser-olympia/) in Philadelphia putting the [Cruiser *Olympia*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Olympia_\(C-6\)) up for sale.  After years of neglect, museum mismanagement and corruption (a [former museum president is now serving hard time in Federal prison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Seaport_Museum#History) for fraud and tax evasion), the museum lacks the money to repair the historic ship or even to scrap her.   Now,  the financially troubled [South Street Seaport](http://www.southstreetseaport.com/) in New York is looking to get rid of its historic vessels on a temporary or permanent basis.
