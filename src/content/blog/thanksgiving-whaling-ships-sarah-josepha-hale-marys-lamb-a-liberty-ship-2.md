![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tgam.jpg)Happy Thanksgiving for those on this side of the pond and below the 49th parallel.  (The Canadians celebrated the holiday in October.) Here is a repost of a story I think is well worth retelling. 

Thanksgiving is one of the central creation myths of the founding of the United States. The story is based on an account of a one time feast of thanksgiving in the Plymouth colony of Massachusetts in 1621 during a period of atypically good relations with local tribes. Thanksgiving only became a national holiday in 1863.  Before the celebration spread across the country, Thanksgiving was most popular in New England. [On 19th-century American whale ships, which sailed from New England ports](http://www.whalingmuseum.org/learn/research-topics/overview-of-north-american-whaling/life-aboard#Holidays), they celebrated only the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Of the three holidays, Thanksgiving may have been the most popular. On [Norfolk Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving#Norfolk_Island) in the Pacific, they also celebrate Thanksgiving, the holiday brought to the island by visiting American whaling ships.

[Sarah Josepha Hale](http://www.pilgrimhallmuseum.org/pdf/Godmother_of_Thanksgiving.pdf) was an early booster of Thanksgiving as a national holiday.  Hale was a poet, novelist, and journal editor from New Hampshire. In 1833, Hale also founded the [Seamen’s Aid Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Seaman%27s_Aid_Society) to assist the surviving families of Boston sailors who died at sea. She may be best remembered for her nursery rhyme, “[Mary’s Lamb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Had_a_Little_Lamb)” which begins, “*Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow*…..”   Between 1837 and 1863, Hale wrote [editorials](http://www.pilgrimhallmuseum.org/pdf/SJH_Editorials.pdf) and letters arguing that Thanksgiving as a national holiday would help unite the nation.  A letter in 1863 to President Abraham Lincoln is credited with influencing Lincoln’s decision to proclaim Thanksgiving a national holiday in October 1863.

Hale died in 1879 at the age of 91.  By then there weren’t many whale ships left celebrating Thanksgiving at sea.  Nevertheless, in 1943, the [Liberty ship # 1538](http://www.usmm.org/l/deltajones.html), built by J. A. Jones Construction Company, Panama City, Florida, was named *Sarah J. Hale* in her honor.
