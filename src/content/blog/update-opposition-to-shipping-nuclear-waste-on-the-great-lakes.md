![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/02/nuclear-waste-sign.jpg)Last week [we posted about the approval granted  by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/08/shipping-of-nuclear-waste-approved-on-the-great-lakes/) to allow Bruce Power to ship 1,600 tonnes of radioactive waste, in the form of 16 decommissioned nuclear reactors, across the Great Lakes, though the St. Lawrence Seaway and across the Atlantic Ocean to Sweden for recycling.  Not everyone is happy about it.   The Ontario First Nations are pointing out that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is “*ignoring the rule of law*” by approving a nuclear waste shipment through the Great Lakes.

*Grand Council Chief Patrick Madahbee says First Nations have to be accommodated on activities that could have an impact on their traditional territories.*

*Madahbee, speaking for 39 member communities of the Anishinabek Nation, notes that Anishinabek First Nation communities occupy all of the Great Lakes shoreline and a significant part of its basin.*

*“When it comes to transporting nuclear wastes through such an important resource as the Great Lakes, there is no such thing as too much consultation,” Madahbee said Tuesday in a release.*

*“Look at what happened with the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico,” he said. “It´s irresponsible to take chances with the transport of hazardous goods.”*

Canadian environmentalists are also not pleased:

*Under a 2006 environmental assessment prepared by Bruce Power and approved by the CNSC, the generators were declared to be radioactive waste that could not be recycled and would therefore be stored at the Bruce station in the Western Waste Management Facility owned and operated by Ontario Power Generation as low-level radioactive waste. They would be stored on the surface until 2043, and underground thereafter.*

*There was an acceptable plan for managing these wastes approved in 2006. Yet five years later, Bruce Power wants to transport these components halfway across the world.*

*Accidents can happen. Like the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River are a tremendous resource and an economic engine for North America. We should not support proposals that potentially threaten these precious waterways, the source of drinking water for almost 40 million people, especially when there are alternatives.*

As the shipment will take place in part through US waters, the United States government will also have a say.

*The agency responsible for oversight of nuclear shipments in the U.S. is DOT’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency that has come under criticism recently for its failure to prevent oil and gas pipeline ruptures.*

*In the final days of his tenure as a U.S. Senator, Democrat Russ Feingold of Wisconsin spearheaded an effort to ensure that the agency doesn’t simply rubber stamp the plan.*

*Feingold, together with Sens. Robert Casey Jr.(D-PA), Kirsten Gellibrand (D-NY), Carl Levin (D-MI), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Richard Durbin (D-IL) and Charles Shumer (D-NY), asked PHMSA to explain how it would handle the request to move the nuclear waste through U.S. waters.*

*In a Nov. 8, 2010 response PHMSA Director Cynthia Quarterman said the agency would begin considering Bruce Power’s application for a “special arrangement” once the shipping plan was approved by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.*

*Over the past two decades the agency has made special arrangements for the shipping of approximately 40 large nuclear power plant components, she said, but “almost all of the prior U.S. consignments had a lesser radioactive hazard than the proposed Canadian steam generator transport.”*

*All but one of the previous nuclear shipments appear to involve ocean shipping rather than transport over the Great Lakes.*

*Quarterman said that PHMSA would solicit input from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission before granting Bruce Power an exemption from safety regulations.*

*Feingold asked whether PHMSA be complying with the National Environmental Policy Act \[which requires formal environmental review of federal actions with significant environmental impact\] and how the agency would ensure public participation and transparency.*

*Quarterman stated that the agency would comply with NEPA, but offered no details on actions to engage the public.*

*“It should be noted that although Canada may approve the initial certificate, the U.S. is in no way bound by their approval,” she said. “The U.S. could require additional conditions or elect not to validate.”*
