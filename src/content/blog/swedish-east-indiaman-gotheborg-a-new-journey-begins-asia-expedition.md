As [we posted in September](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/09/gotheborg-expedition-2022-sailing-for-asia-in-april/), the replica Swedish East Indiaman [*Götheborg*](https://www.gotheborg.se/) is preparing to sail for Asia in April of 2022. The expedition is intended to promote and open new trade opportunities for Swedish and Asian companies. The nearly 60-meter (197-feet) long East Indiaman is billed the world’s largest operational wooden sailing vessel and is modeled after the *Götheborg* that sank off Gothenburg, Sweden in 1745. Here is a short video about the upcoming voyage.
