![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/camdenfest.jpg) [Camden, Maine’s Windjammer Festival](http://camdenwindjammerfestival.com/) starts  Friday, September 3rd, and runs through Sunday.   Camden’s harbor always seemed to me to be a windjammer festival on virtually any summer day so this gathering  of the Maine Windjammer fleet and the dockside Maritime Heritage Fair should be quite an event.  Unfortunately the festivities begin with a mock pirate attack on Camden harbor, which seems to be the obligatory nod to the Disneyfication of pirates.    Neverthess, the rest of the activities look great.

Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for pointing out the festival.
