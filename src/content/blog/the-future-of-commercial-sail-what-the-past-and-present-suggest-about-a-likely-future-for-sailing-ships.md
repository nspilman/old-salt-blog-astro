![beamon1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/beamon1.jpg)For those near New York harbor next Monday, I will be giving a presentation on “*The Future of Commercial Sail*” at the monthly New York City Shiplore meeting on Monday, June 10th at 7:30 PM at  79 Walker Street, 5th floor, in Manhattan.

Oil prices are four times higher today than they were just a decade ago.  Wind power is the fastest growing sector in the energy business.  Is it time for a return to wind power to propel modern commercial ships?

In Monday’s presentation, we will be looking at what made the windjammers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries uneconomical, and the impact of current energy prices and new environmental rules on shipping; and will ask whether these economics might justify a return to commercial sail.  We will also look at a variety of new designs of sailing ships being developed by a new generation of naval architects.  It should be fun evening.  If you are the neighborhood, stop by.
