![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/figureheadshe.jpg)There has been a minor hub-bub of late over the decision by the [Scottish Maritime Museum to use gender-neutral references to ships](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/23/gender-neutral-boats-rise-maritime-museum-removes-signs-referring/) after vandals have scratched out references to “she” several times on museum displays. Putting aside the question of whether vandals are the best choice for dictating museum policies, the museum is not alone in moving to gender-neutral labeling for ships. Lloyd’s List, the more than 280-year-old publication has been [referring to ships as “it” rather than as “she” since 2002.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1388373/Lloyds-List-sinks-the-tradition-of-calling-ships-she.html) 

Not surprisingly, not everyone is happy with the change. The [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/23/gender-neutral-boats-rise-maritime-museum-removes-signs-referring/) reports that supporters of the museum expressed their dismay on social media. “This isn’t how it works. You don’t get to erase history, and like it or not ships have always been referred to as she,” said Jennifer Sorbara.

Well, maybe yes and maybe no. This may be true for English speakers but shipping is and has always been an international business. In other languages, ships can be he, she or it, sometimes both. 

OK, so let’s get specific. Perhaps ironically, the question of gender arises specifically because English does not specify noun genders like so many languages. 

In Dutch, the word for ship, schip, is a neuter noun so the pronoun is “it.” The same is true for German, Schiff, and Norwegian, skip. In Greek ships are also “it.”

In Dutch and German the words for boat are also neuter nouns.  On the other hand, Bootsfahrt, a boat trip, is feminine. In Norwegian, while ships are “it,” the word for boat, båt, is masculine, so the pronoun is “he.” 

In French, most words for ships or boats are masculine, including navire, bateau, and, vaisseau. The exception is the word for launch, chaloupe, which is feminine. 

In Spanish, words for ships are both masculine and feminine so ships can be either “he” or “she” depending on the word you use. Barco and buque are both “he,” whereas nave and embarcación are “she.” 

And so on. By now I am sure that you get the idea. Ships can be any gender or none at all depending on which language one is using. 

If English speaking fleets dominated the world of shipping as Britain did during past centuries and as the United States did briefly in the 19th and 20th centuries, a case might be made that English speaking traditions should hold sway. That, however, is not the case today, so perhaps some flexibility is in order.
