![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trueconfidnece.jpg)A Houthi missile attack killed three seafarers on M/V [*True Confidence*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/9460784), a Barbados-flagged, Liberian-owned, bulk carrier while transiting the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday, [U.S. Central Command](https://twitter.com/CENTCOM/status/1765497688710173116) (CENTCOM) said. The deaths are the first merchant mariner fatalities reported since the Iran-aligned Yemeni group began strikes against shipping in one of the world’s busiest trade lanes.

At least four other crew are reported to have been injured in the attack, which resulted in significant damage to the ship. The crew abandoned the ship and were assisted by coalition warships. 

CENTCOM reported that this was the fifth anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM) fired by Houthis in a two-day period. Two of these ASBMs struck two shipping vessels – [M/V *MSC Sky II*](https://www.marineinsight.com/shipping-news/houthi-missile-strikes-msc-container-ship-msc-sky-ii-in-the-gulf-of-aden/) and M/V *True Confidence* – and one ASBM was shot down by USS *Carney* (DDG 64).  The *Carney* also shot down three suicide drones in the same attack.

Roughly a week ago, the [*Rubymar*](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2024/03/update-bulker-mv-rubymar-sinks-after-being-struck-by-houthi-missile-almost-two-weeks-ago/), a UK-owned bulk carrier, became the first ship to sink as a result of a Houthi attack, after floating for two weeks with severe damage from a missile strike. All crew were safely evacuated from that vessel.

While the militia has said it would attack vessels with links to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Israel, shipping industry sources say all ships could be at risk.

The *True Confidence* is owned by the Liberian-registered company True Confidence Shipping and operated by the Greece-based Third January Maritime, both companies said in their joint statement. They said the ship had no link to the United States.
