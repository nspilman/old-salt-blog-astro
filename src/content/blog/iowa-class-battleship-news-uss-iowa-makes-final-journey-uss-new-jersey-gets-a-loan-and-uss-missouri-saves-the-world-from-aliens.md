![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/uss-iowa-museum.jpg)These are busy time for the World War II vintage Iowa Class battleships. The [*USS Iowa* arrived yesterday in the Port of Los Angeles](http://photoblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/09/12146068-uss-iowa-makes-final-journey-to-become-a-floating-museum-in-san-pedra-calif?lite) to tie up alongside her new permanent home, Berth 87, in San Pedro, California, where she will become a museum ship.

On the East coast, the *[USS New Jersey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_New_Jersey_\(BB-62\))*, a museum ship in Camden, NJ since 2001, has been suffering hard times financially due to a drop in tourism and a cut in state funding.  Last Wednesday, [it received a a $900,000 loan guarantee from the Delaware River Port Authority.](http://articles.philly.com/2012-06-07/news/32079818_1_loan-guarantee-home-port-alliance-inspector)  This doesn’t solve the ship’s financial problems, but certainly buys some time.

In Hawaii, the *[USS Missouri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Missouri_\(BB-63\))*, a museum ship since 1999, helped to fight off an alien invasion and save the the world.  OK, it actually fought off the alien invasion in the big budget movie, [Battleship](http://www.battleshipmovie.com/).  Apparently, the rest of the navy is blocked by an impenetrable force filed so a group of renegade officers and World War II vets and museum volunteers put the USS *Missouri* to sea to save the planet.  The movie only got a [34% rating on Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/battleship/) but we hear that the USS *Missouri* gave a wonderful performance.  
  
There is apparently no new news on the forth Iowa class battleship, the *[USS Wisconsin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Wisconsin_\(BB-64\))*, at the [Nauticus](http://www.nauticus.org/) maritime museum in Norfolk, Virginia.  Nevertheless, it is good to know that she is there in case of an alien invasion, or more  likely, a movie sequel.  Thanks to Phil Leon for contributing to this post.
