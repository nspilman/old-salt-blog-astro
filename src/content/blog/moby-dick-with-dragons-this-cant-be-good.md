This can’t be good unless it is so bad that it is good. A new movie is coming out whose high concept pitch had to be, “It is *Moby Dick* but with dragons, instead of whales.”  The trailer is below and the plot summary from IMDB is after the jump.  Notice that whaleship *Rachel* in the book has morphed into Ahab’s beautiful daughter and love interest for Ishmael.  Danny Glover plays Ahab and while the lovely newcomer Sofia Pernas plays Rachel.

*Age of the Dragons is a re-imagining of Herman Melville’s classic novel Moby Dick. Set in a mythical realm where Captain Ahab and crew hunt dragons for the vitriol that powers their world, Ishmael, a charismatic harpooner joins their quest. Ahab’s adopted daughter Rachel, beautiful and tough, runs the hunting vessel. Ahab’s obsession is to seek revenge on a great “White Dragon” that slaughtered his family when he was young and left his body scarred and mauled, drives the crew deeper into the heart of darkness. In the White Dragon’s lair Ahab’s secrets are revealed and Rachel must choose between following him on his dark quest or escaping to a new life with Ishmael.*
