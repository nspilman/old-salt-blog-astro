![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/philomenadrake.jpg)Yesterday [we posted about an out-of-control bulk carrier](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/04/bulk-carrier-destroys-mansion-on-the-banks-of-the-bosporus/) which, after losing its steering gear, destroyed a mansion on the banks of the Bosphorus. By my count, roughly half of the media reports described the ship as a tanker, because apparently, many in the non-maritime media think that all large merchant ships are tankers.  Anyone who has spent time in shipping sooner or later expects the media to get at least the terminology wrong. With that in mind, we offer the video below from BBC2, in which [Philomena Cunk explains what life must have been like on Drake’s ship](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0634q44), the Golden Hind, when they first circumcised the world. 

Yes, this is satire. Philomena Cunk is a character developed by English actress, comedian, and writer, [Diane Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Morgan). The clip, after the break, is from her BBC mockumentary series “[Cunk on Britain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09yp1gr).”
