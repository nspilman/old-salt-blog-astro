![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/titanic-ii.jpg)Excentric Australian billionaire Clive Palmer made quite a splash in 2012 when he announced his plans to build [a 21st-century almost a replica of the*Titanic*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/titanic-ii-unsinkable-australian-billionaire-clive-palmer-has-big-plans/) and sail it from England to New York by the end of 2016. That didn’t happen. In fact, the project has been dead in the water since 2015, [reportedly over disputed royalties](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-45663941) from a Chinese conglomerate. 

Last October, reports emerged that [the project was back on again](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/titanic-ii-unsinkable-australian-billionaire-clive-palmer-has-big-plans/), and in mid-January, Clive Palmer’s [Blue Star Line](https://www.bluestarline.com.au/) entered into a contract with the Finnish naval architecture and engineering firm, [Deltamarin](https://www.deltamarin.com/2019/01/deltamarins-further-involvement-in-titanic-ii-project-confirmed/), to continue with the design of the ship. The newly announced [delivery date of the ship is 2022](https://www.irishcentral.com/news/titanic-ii-sail-2022).

How real is the project? Since 2012, there has been a preliminary agreement with Chinese state-owned CSC Jinling Shipyard. So far, there is no actual shipbuilding contract, however. *Titanic II* would be the first major passenger vessel constructed in China. It is an open question whether CSC Jinling is capable of building a ship of this size.

As a general rule, I would suggest that nothing is real until they are cutting steel. There is still a considerable distance from design to fabrication. 

Even though the new ship has been described as a near replica it is significantly different from the original in many respects, including:

*   More beam — to meet current stability requirements the *Titanic II* will be 4.2 meters wider than the original.
*   No steam — the new ship will have modern diesel-electric propulsion with three pod drives in lieu of propeller shafts and rudders.
*   No sheer — Unlike the original, the new ship will have no hull sheer.
*   Welded hull, no rivets, improved quality of steel.
*   More lifeboats (no surprise there.) New “Safety deck” to move the lifeboats lower and to provide access
*   Air conditioning
*   Modern navigation and electronics but no internet or wireless aboard.
