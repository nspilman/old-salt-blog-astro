On Sunday, June 3rd, the [Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Weekend](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/the_queens_diamond_jubilee/) will culminate with a seven-mile flotilla of 1,000 ships and boats making up the biggest gathering on the Thames in 350 years. One of those vessels will be the sail training ship *[Pelican](http://www.adventureundersail.com/index.html)*. The *Pelican*, a 148ft long three-masted barquentine, is one of our favorite ships. She is square rigged on the main mast but fore and aft rigged on the fore mast and mizzen — a modern hybrid between a traditional square rig and the mixed square and fore and aft rig of the Barbary coast Xebecs. A short video of the ship shot by [The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/the_queens_diamond_jubilee/9271496/Exclusive-on-board-the-Pelican-of-London-a-Diamond-Jubilee-Thames-pageant-Tall-Ship.html).
