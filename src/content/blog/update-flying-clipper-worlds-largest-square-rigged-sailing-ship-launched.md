![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/flyingclipper.jpg)We have been following the progress of [Star Clipper](http://www.starclippers.com/us-dom)‘s new ship, the *Flying Clipper*, since [her announcement](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/05/star-clippers-building-worlds-largest-square-rigged-passenger-ship/) in May 2015, through her [keel laying at the Brodosplit Shipyard](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/12/keel-laying-star-clippers-near-replica-france-ii/) in Split, Croatia, in December of that year. On Saturday the [*Flying Clipper* was launched](http://maritime-executive.com/article/worlds-largest-sailing-ship-launched) at the Brodosplit shipyard.  

When the *Flying Clipper* makes her first voyage, expected in early 2018, she will be the largest square-rigged sailing ship in the world. A five masted barque, she is 532 feet (162 meters) long, with a 60 foot (18.5 meter) beam and will have a sail area of 68,300 square feet (6,347 square meters). By comparison, the tea clipper [*Cutty Sark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark) set less than half as much sail at around 3,000 square meters. 

The ship, which was inspired by the [*France II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_II)  of 1912, will have a capacity for 300 passengers and a crew of 150. *Flying Clipper* will have a gross tonnage of 8,770 GT.

Like the other three Star Clipper ship, the *Flying Clipper* is primarily a sailing ship with auxiliary engines. Star Clipper also operates the [*Star Clipper*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Clipper) and the [*Star Flyer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Flyer), two 170 passenger four masted barquentines, as well as the [*Royal Clipper,*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Clipper) a 227 passenger five masted square-rigged ship inspired by the *[Preussen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preu%C3%9Fen_\(ship\)).* Prior to the delivery of the *Flying Clipper*, the *Royal Clipper* was the world’s largest square-rigged ship with a sail area of 56,000 ft² (5,202.6 m²).
