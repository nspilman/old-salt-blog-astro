One hundred and forty-two years ago today on October 27th, 1877, the three-masted iron-hulled merchant sailing ship [*Elissa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elissa_\(ship\)) was launched in Aberdeen, Scotland. She is now a museum ship at the [Texas Seaport Museum](http://www.galvestonhistory.org/attractions/maritime-heritage/1877-tall-ship-elissa-3). In honor of her birthday, here is a repost of a video by Mike Headley of the *Elissa* on her yearly sail.
