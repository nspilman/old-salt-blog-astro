![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/mysongoverboard.jpg)How is our week going so far? Probably better than [Pier Luigi Loro Piana](https://www.forbes.com/profile/pier-luigi-loro-piana/#793a35e73801) and also no doubt better than the captain of the [general cargo ship *Brattingsborg*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:728284/mmsi:374039000/imo:9488035/vessel:BRATTINGSBORG). The ship was carrying the 130′ (39.9 meter) yacht, *My Song*, owned by Mr. Loro Piana, from the Caribbean to the Mediterranean. The yacht was bound ultimately for [Porto Cervo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Cervo), in northern Sardinia, where it was supposed to take part in the upcoming [Loro Piana Superyacht Regatta](https://www.yccs.it/en/regate-2019/loro_piana_superyacht_regatta-273.html). Sadly, the mega-yacht never made it. The *Brattingsborg* was struck by a storm near the Gulf of Lion. Sometime late Saturday or early Sunday, the yacht *My Song* was lost over the side.

The all carbon fiber [Baltic 130 yacht](https://www.balticyachts.fi/yachts/baltic-130-my-song/) was valued at 30 million Euros. Weighing at 105 tons (including the 36-ton lifting keel), she was capable of 30 knots powered by her 56-meter-high Southern Spars rig with North Sails.  In addition to winning multiple races, *My Song* was awarded the Best Sailing Yacht of 30-meters to 39.9-meters in the [2017 World Superyacht Awards.](https://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2017/05/15/world-superyacht-awards-2017/) She was also declared Boat of the Year at the Italian Sailing Federation’s Sailor of the Year awards.
