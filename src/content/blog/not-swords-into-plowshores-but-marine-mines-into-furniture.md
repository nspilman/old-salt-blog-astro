[Mati Karmin](http://www.karmin.ee/index_e.php), an Estonian sculptor, is not turning swords into plowshares, but he is turning [marine mines](http://www.marinemine.com/#mainpage) into some rather remarkable furniture and household appliances.  Karmin’s mine furniture is steampunk with a post-apocalyptic twist.   On the northern coast of Estonia, especially on Naissaar and other islands, there were large fields of anti-submarine mines left behind when the Soviets withdrew in the early 90s. The explosives in the mines had been burned out, leaving rusting steel spheres.  Karmin has turned these relics of war into armchairs, fireplaces, baby carriages, swings, beds, desks and and a variety of other useful and quirky items.
