Here is a video of the scuttling of [HMS *Implacable*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Implacable_\(1805\)) in 1949.  She was originally the French Navy’s Téméraire-class ship of the line *Duguay-Trouin*, launched in 1800.  The *Duguay-Trouin* fought in and survived the [Battle of Trafalgar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar), only to be captured by the British in the [Battle of Cape Ortegal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Ortegal) and renamed *Implacable*.  When scuttled in 1949,  HMS *Implacable* was the second oldest ship of the Navy after HMS *Victory*. There were major protests against her disposal, but given the post-War austerity, the British government decided against the cost of her restoration. In 1947 the British government had offered her to the French, who also declined the offer based on restoration costs.  The *Implacable’s* figurehead and stern galleries were removed prior to scuttling and are on display in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, while her capstan is on display at the maritime museum at Rochefort.

The protests over the scuttling of HMS *Implacable* are believed to have contributed to the British government’s decision to preserve the clipper ship *Cutty Sark.*   Thanks to Andrew Reinbach for pointing out the video on Facebook.
