![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Sagrestallship.jpg)Last week, one of my favorite tall ships, the [Portuguese Sail Training Ship *Sagres*](http://sagres.marinha.pt/NRPSagres/Site/EN) visited San Diego, California. This weekend, on the Gulf Coast in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the US Navy christened the [*USS San Diego*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_San_Diego_\(LPD-22\)), a San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship.    Not to be too critical of the grey-stack line, but the Portuguese Navy has the better looking ship.
