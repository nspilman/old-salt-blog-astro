![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/barrel.jpg)On Wednesday, 71-year-old  French adventurer Jean-Jacques Savin set off to cross the Atlantic in an unlikely craft — a barrel. He departed from El Hierro, one of the Canary Islands, west of Morocco, in a barrel-shaped capsule with the intention of drifting, carried by the winds and currents, across the Atlantic Ocean. He hopes to arrive in the Caribbean in about three months. The barrel in which he is drifting is 10 feet long and 6 feet 8 inches wide, built of epoxy and plywood and ballasted with concrete.

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/world/europe/france-barrel-atlantic-jean-jacques-savin.html) reports that Mr. Savin has already crossed the Atlantic four times using a sailboat. His new venture comes decades after another Frenchman, Alain Bombard, set out from the Canary Islands to Barbados in a small rubber boat in 1952, subsisting only on seawater, plankton and raw fish.

Mr. Savin has a few home comforts on board: A wine lover, he is carrying an amphora of wine from near Bordeaux. Another bottle remained in France, and experts will compare the taste of the two after Mr. Savin’s return. But the capsule, which he said he built himself this year in a small shipyard in Arès, offers Spartan living quarters.

A bunk bed, a captain’s seat and a kitchen counter take up most of the interior, and there is barely enough space for a man to stand. Two doctors will study Mr. Savin’s health and behavior after months in such a confined space at sea.

On his project’s [website](http://www.atlantique-tonneau.com/), Mr. Savin — a former military parachutist, pilot and park ranger in Africa — described his venture as a “crossing during which man isn’t captain of his ship, but a passenger of the ocean.”

A [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/BOUTESA/) has been set up to track Mr. Savin’s progress across the Atlantic.
