![Yacht-Ashore](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/03/Yacht-Ashore.jpg)Two men and a woman brought pizza and beer aboard the 82′ sailing yacht *Darlin* in the Sausalito Yacht Harbor late Sunday or early Monday and proceeded to take the boat to sea, only to run aground in shallow water near Pacifica State Beach in Sausalito.  The owner of the *Darlin* saw his yacht on the television coverage of the grounding and reported it stolen.  The apparent thieves repeatedly declined assistance and refused to leave the grounded boat.  A standoff  ensued for several hours with the Coast Guard and local authorities.  Ultimately, [Pacifica police arrested Leslie Gardner, 63, Dario Mira, 54, and Lisa Modawell, 56,](http://www.seattlepi.com/news/crime/article/Stolen-yacht-runs-aground-at-Pacifica-3-arrested-4326783.php) on suspicion of grand theft and conspiracy. Each of the three was being held on more than $1 million bail.  The yacht  *Darlin* was removed at high tide with reported damage to the rudder and keel.  Thanks to Phil Leon and Bob McKane for contributing to the post.
