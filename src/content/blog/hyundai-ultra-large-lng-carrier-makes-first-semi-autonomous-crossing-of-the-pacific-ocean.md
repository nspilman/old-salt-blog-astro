![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/06/prismcourage.jpg)Earlier this month, the 180,000 cubic meter ultra-large LNG carrier [*Prism Courage*](https://lngprime.com/americas/sk-shippings-lng-carrier-completes-autonomous-transoceanic-trip/53480/) completed a voyage from the Gulf of Mexico to South Korea using a [semi-autonomous navigation system developed by HD Hyundai subsidiary Avikus](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hd-hyundais-avikus-successfully-conducts-the-worlds-first-transoceanic-voyage-of-a-large-merchant-ship-relying-on-autonomous-navigation-technologies-301559937.html).

Delivered to South Korea’s [SK Shipping](https://www.skshipping.com/eng/index.aspx) last year by shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries,  *Prism Courage*, arrived at the Boryeong LNG Terminal in South Korea from the Freeport LNG terminal, Texas, via the Panama Canal, after completing a 33-day voyage.

The ship is equipped with the [HiNAS 2.0](https://www.avikus.ai/eng/product/hinas), Level 2 (Hyundai intelligent Navigation Assistant System) autonomous navigation solution developed by [Avikus](https://www.avikus.ai/eng/main), and sailed half of the roughly 20,000 kilometers voyage utilizing the HiNAS 2.0 autonomous navigation technology.

In the ocean crossing, the *Prism Courage,* equipped with HiNAS 2.0, was operated autonomously on the optimal routes, increasing the fuel efficiency by around 7 percent while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by about 5 percent. Also, the system accurately recognized the locations of nearby ships during operation to avoid collision over 100 times.

This voyage was conducted under real-time monitoring of the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and the Korea Register of Shipping (KR) to verify the performance and stability of the technology. Avikus plans to commercialize HiNAS 2.0 within this year after receiving a certification from ABS for the results of this self-propelled ocean crossing.
