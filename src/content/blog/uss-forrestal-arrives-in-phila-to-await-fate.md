*The aircraft carrier Forrestal arrived in Philadelphia Friday morning to await its fate.*

*The ship, decommissioned in 1993 in Philadelphia after 38 years in service, had been moored next to the Saratoga in Newport, R.I. It left under tow Tuesday.*  
  
*The Navy initially offered the carrier as a possible museum, but withdrew it from the ship donation list when no viable plan emerged.*

*The ship, the first of the post-World War II “super carriers,” will now be either scrapped or sunk to become an offshore reef.*

*In Philadelphia, the Forrestal is docked on the Delaware River at the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard next to the John F. Kennedy, an aircraft carrier decommissioned in 2007.*
