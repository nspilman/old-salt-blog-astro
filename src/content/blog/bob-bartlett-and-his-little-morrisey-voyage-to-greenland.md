Yesterday, [we posted about the restoration](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/06/restoration-ernestina-morrissey-continues/) of the historic schooner [*Ernestina,* ex-*Effie M. Morrissey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effie_M._Morrissey).  Here is a documentary, narrated by the polar explorer, [Captain Bob Bartlett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bartlett_\(explorer\)), describing a voyage to Greenland in the schooner he refers to as his “*Little Morrisey*.”

Captain Bartlett sailed with [Robert Peary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Peary) in his expeditions to the North Pole. Bartlett sailed the schooner [*Morrissey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effie_M._Morrissey) in twenty voyages to the Arctic.  In total, Bartlett spent more than 50 years mapping and exploring the waters of the Arctic and led over 40 expeditions, more than anyone before or since.  While this film is dated 1947, it was shot on an earlier voyage north, as Captain Bartlett died in 1946.
