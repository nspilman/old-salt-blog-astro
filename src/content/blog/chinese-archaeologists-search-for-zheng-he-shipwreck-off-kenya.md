[Experts set to unravel puzzle of a Chinese ship that sank near Lamu](http://www.nation.co.ke/News/regional/-/1070/965156/-/9a6t5r/-/index.html)  
  
*The long-awaited work to unravel the history of a Chinese vessel that sank in Kenyan waters more than 600 years ago is set to begin with the arrival of Chinese archaeologists.*

*The national museums of China and Kenya have organised a joint archaeological dig on and around Lamu islands, where one of Chinese navigator Zheng He’s ships is believed to have sunk in the 15th Century.*

*National Museums of Kenya assistant director in charge of Coast region Athman Hussein said archaeologists from the two countries expected to get the wrecks of the fleet of the legendary Zheng.*

*He said the experts would conduct both terrestrial and underwater archaeology and use the data to try and understand the weather patterns which could have led to the mishap.*

*Since 2005, the Chinese Government has been dispatching teams of experts to the island after records confirmed the exact location of the capsized legendary Chinese ship, which has been lying on the ocean floor for years.*
