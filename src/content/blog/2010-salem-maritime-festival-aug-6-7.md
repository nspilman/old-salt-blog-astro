The [Salem Maritime Festival](http://www.nps.gov/sama/planyourvisit/maritimefestival.htm) starts this Friday.  The tall ship [*Friendship of Salem*](http://www.salemweb.com/frndship/) will be joined in port by [Schooner Thomas E. Lannon](http://www.schooner.org/) and [Schooner Fame of Salem](http://www.schoonerfame.com/).   The *[Friendship](http://www.salemweb.com/frndship/) is a replica of an 1797 East Indiaman.    The [Thomas E.
