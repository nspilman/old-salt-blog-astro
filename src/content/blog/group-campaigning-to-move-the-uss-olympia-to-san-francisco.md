![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/olympia3.jpg)A group of former workers at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in the San Francisco Bay Area has launched a campaign to bring the *USS Olympia* to San Pablo Bay.  The *Olympia*, Commodore George Dewey’s flagship at the Battle of Manila Bay, is the only surviving steel warship of its era.

*The USS Olympia, a veteran of the 1898 Spanish-American War, has caught the attention of the Navy Yard Association of Mare Island.*

*The Olympia is one of the most significant naval vessels, said Navy Yard Association member Dennis Kelly, project manager for the campaign.*

*A National Historic Landmark, the Olympia’s last official naval mission was to carry the body of the unknown soldier from France to the United States in 1921.*

*Built at San Francisco’s Union Iron Works and launched in 1892, the ship could be scrapped or sunk unless a way is found to save it.*

*The 244-foot-long ship is moored on the Delaware River in Philadelphia and part of the Independence Seaport Museum, which is searching for a new ship’s steward.*

*“It’s a beautiful ship, and it’s been let go,” said Yard Association board President Ralph McComb.*

*After its launching, the ship came to Mare Island for final outfitting and later returned for repairs several times, said Vallejo Naval and Historical Museum Director Jim Kern.*
