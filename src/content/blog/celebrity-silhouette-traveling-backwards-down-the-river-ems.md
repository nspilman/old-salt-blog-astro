This is an interesting and perhaps an unintentionally amusing clip of the *[Celebrity Silhouette](http://www.celebritycruises.com/plancruise/ships/ship.do;jsessionid=0000xujxOqgfFejRqbCOe3uZjS9:12h3rnd1c?shipCode=SI&cS=SIDENAV?CID=PS_GOOGLE_CEL_Silhouette%20Ship)* leaving the [Meyer Werft Shipyard](http://www.meyerwerft.com/page.asp?main=0&subs=0&websub=m1s0&lang=e) in Papenburg, Germany. The shipyard has just enough room to build the ship but not to turn her around, so she was towed down the River Ems backwards.

What struck me as unintentionally amusing were the repeated statements of how amazing, exciting and incredible  moving the ship down the river was by the Celebrity executives. About the fourth or fifth time I heard their gushing enthusiasm, I found myself thinking, well, it wasn’t that impressive.
