![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/everforward.jpg)Last March, [we posted about the grounding](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/03/container-ship-ever-forward-aground-in-chesapeake-bay/) of the container ship [*Ever Forward*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:6378710/mmsi:563161200/imo:9850551/vessel:EVER_FORWARD) near Baltimore in the Chesapeake Bay. The ship failed to make a turn in the Craighill channel and ran hard aground on a mud flat, where it remained stuck for more than 35 days. At the time, we noted that it was unclear whether human error or a mechanical failure caused the casualty. The *Ever Forward* had a pilot aboard at the time of the grounding.

The Coast Guard has now answered that question. Their [accident investigation report](https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/5p/CG-5PC/INV/docs/documents/EverForwardGrounding_ROI_Redacted.pdf?ver=odDgOSiBdmfRW2gXWrdnEQ%3D%3D) “determined the incident’s causal factors to be the pilot’s failure to maintain situational awareness and attention while navigating, and inadequate bridge resource management.” They found that the accident was due to the pilot’s inattention while on his cell phone including sending texts, making a series of phone calls, and drafting an email while the ship was underway. 

The executive summary of the report noted that “a licensed Maryland State Pilot … (was) in direction and control of the vessel,” and just prior to the grounding of the Hong Kong-flagged *Ever Forward*, he exited the active navigation of his portable pilot unit to view a previous transit.

“(Pilot 1) also made a series of five phone calls amounting to over 60 minutes of time during the course of his outbound transit,” the report stated. “He also sent two text messages and began drafting an email immediately before the grounding occurred regarding issues he experienced with facility line handlers.”

[WavyTV.com](https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/coast-guard-norfolk-bound-ever-forward-pilot-was-texting-making-calls-just-before-grounding-of-container-ship/) notes that the time the pilot spent on his phone amounted to about half of the vessel’s two-hour voyage, and the person was doing so right up until the incident took place. The pilot also admitted to relying solely on the portable pilot unit for navigation and was watching a playback of a previous transit when the vessel’s grounding took place.

“The Pilot was drafting an email on their personal cell phone in the minutes leading up to the planned turn south, when the vessel sailed through its waypoint and grounding,” the Coast Guard’s findings of concern on distracted operations stated. “The vessel’s bridge team attempted to cue the pilot by repeating the heading. However, by the time the bridge team became more assertive about the ship’s heading, it was too late to prevent the vessel from grounding.”

The Coast Guard determined that what initiated the issues with the vessel was its grounding.

“No mechanical issues or equipment failures contributed to this marine casualty,” according to the report.
