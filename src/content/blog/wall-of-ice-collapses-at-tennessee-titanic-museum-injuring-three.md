![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/titanicPFT.jpg)Last week, a wall of ice, representing an iceberg, collapsed at the [Titanic Museum Attraction](https://titanicpigeonforge.com/) in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, injuring three guests. The injured were taken to a local hospital. The extent of the injuries was not revealed.

From the attraction [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/TitanicMuseumAttraction/posts/10165466106545611): *Immediately following the accident, Titanic Museum Attraction was closed, and as of the morning of Tuesday, Aug. 3, we reopened to ticketed passengers. The iceberg wall does not currently exist, and the affected area has been blocked off, for the time being. We anticipate it will take at least four weeks for the iceberg to rebuild.*

The attraction is a building said to represent a half-scale version of a portion of the famous ship. It is billed as the largest permanent Titanic museum in the world, or at least one of two, as a similar attraction has also been built in [Branson, MO](https://titanicbranson.com/). 

The 2-hour, self-guided tour is said to be designed to give guests the sensation of being an original passenger on the Titanic’s 1912 maiden voyage. Injuries by a collapsing ice wall may be taking the experience too far.
