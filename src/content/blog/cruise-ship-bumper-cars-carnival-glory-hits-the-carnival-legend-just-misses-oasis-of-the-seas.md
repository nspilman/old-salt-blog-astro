![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cglory-stern.jpg)This morning while maneuvering to come into the dock at Cozumel, Mexico, the cruise ship [*Carnival Glory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_Glory), collided with the docked cruise ship, [*Carnival Legend*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_Legend), and narrowly averted hitting the Royal Caribbean Lines [*Oasis of the Seas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis_of_the_Seas), which was also at the dock. Video, taken by passengers on the *Oasis of the Seas*, shows that as the *Carnival Glory* is passing the *Carnival Legend*, the *Glory*‘s stern sideswipes the *Legend*‘s bow. Six people were reported to have sustained minor injuries in the collision which damaged at least two decks on the stern of the *Glory*. 

The *Carnival Glory* was based in New Orleans and left the city on Dec. 15. It is still scheduled to depart Cozumel Friday and return to New Orleans on Dec. 22, a spokesperson told [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/carnival-cruise-assessing-damage-ships-collision/story?id=67851438).

A statement from Carnival said, “We are assessing the damage but there are no issues that impact the seaworthiness of either ship. We have advised guests from both ships to enjoy their day ashore in Cozumel,” the statement added.

*Carnival Glory* was delivered in 2003 and has a capacity of over 4,000 passengers and crew. The *Carnival Legend* has been in service since 2002 and has a capacity of over 3,000 passengers and crew. The *Oasis of the Seas,* delivered in 2009, is one of the largest cruise ships in the world with a passenger and crew capacity of almost 8,000.
