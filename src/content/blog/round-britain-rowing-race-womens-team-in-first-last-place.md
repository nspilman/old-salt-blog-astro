![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/06/go_commando.jpg)The Virgin GB Row 2010 is one of  strangest and most challenging rowing races in the world.    As described on the [Virgin GB Row 2010 website](http://www.gbrowchallenge.com/about.php):

*It’s 2,010 miles non-stop and unassisted rowing around Great Britain in some of the most dangerous tides on the globe, in the busiest shipping lanes and with some of the most unpredictable summer weather anywhere.* *Together all those hazards make this officially the toughest rowing race in the world – tougher even than rowing the Pacific or the Atlantic.*  
  
*Only one other crew has ever before successfully completed a non-stop, unassisted row around Britain.*

*That’s right, in the history of the race, only once crew, in 2005, has ever finished the race.   This year, two teams with four rowers each  started out. One team, The Misfits, was all male while the other, the Seagals, is female.  Now roughly 17 days into the race, the Misfits have dropped out and Seagals continue rowing in their 24 boat, ”Go Commando,” against headwinds and contrary currents.   We can only wish them well.*

*Thanks to [David Hayes](http://www.historicnavalfiction.net/) for pointing the race out.*
