![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/08/ldekkerdeparts.jpg)[Laura Dekker](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/29/fourteen-year-old-laura-dekker-has-dutch-court-ok-to-sail-around-the-world/), the Dutch 14 year old, reportedly set sail on Saturday on her attempt to sail around the world alone, at least according to her manager.   Ms. Dekker was originally reported to have departed from Portugal but is now believed to have left via Gibraltar on her 38′ yacht, *Guppy*.  If she completes the voyage within two years she will be the youngest person to have completed a single-handed circumnavigation.   Australian teenager [Jessica Watson](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/05/18/jessica-watson-arrives-in-sydney-harbor/) is likely to retain the tile of the youngest to single-hand around the world non-stop as Ms. Dekker is reportedly planning at stopping in as many as 20 ports along the way.   Last April Ms Dekker won a court case against Dutch social services who sought to prevent her from making the circumnavigation attempt due to her age.
