![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/efr2.jpg)A group of maritime organizations is raising money to provide much-needed emergency funding for developing world seafarers. From their [Crowdfunder](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/emergency-support-for-developing-world-seafarers) page:

While much of the shipping industry take their responsibilities to their seafarers very seriously there is still a real challenge facing many seafarers from the poorer regions of the world. Many are in lock down with casual contracts and unable to work, others are facing difficulties due to lock downs when they leave ships and are unable to return to their families with costs and little income coming in and there are even some reports of seafarers being shunned on their return to their homes for fears of the virus. There is also the issue of their families not having an income in order to get by.

**The situation is likely to get far worse before it gets better.**

Getting emergency help to these seafarers and their families will become even more imperative as the impact of the crisis is felt by small ship operators in those regions, with limited resources to support workers and as the pandemic expands in the developing world where financial and health resources are scarce.

**Where will the funds go?** 

All funds raised will go straight to the International Seafarers’ Welfare and Assistance Network (ISWAN), a UK registered charity, and dispersed through their Seafarers Emergency Fund (SEF). Their membership includes seafarer associations throughout the developing world alongside shipping companies and shipping organisations.

ISWAN has agreed to ring-fence the donations from this campaign ensuring that 100% of all funds raised will be made available to developing world recipients and all administration costs will be covered by the charity.

The Seafarers Emergency Fund (SEF) is available to provide immediate, essential aid to seafarers and families of seafarers, who are directly involved in sudden or unforeseen crises. The fund may be needed to cover expenses such as psychological counselling, medical bills, repatriation and other unexpected costs.

**The Call**

We call on the maritime industry, the business community, and the general public who all depend on this vital industry to show their support for seafarers.

The campaign is being coordinated by Gavin Allwright in association with the [International Seafarers’ Welfare and Assistance Network](http://www.seafarerswelfare.org) (ISWAN), the [World Ocean Council](http://www.oceancouncil.org), the [North American Marine Environment Protection Association](http://www.namepa.net) (NAMEPA), the [Nautical Institute](http://www.nautinst.org), [Green Marine](https://green-marine.org), and the [International Windship Association](http://www.wind-ship.org) (IWSA).
