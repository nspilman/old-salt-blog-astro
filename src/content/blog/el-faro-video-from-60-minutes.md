The news program [60 Minutes](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-el-faro-lost-in-the-bermuda-triangle/) broadcast National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB) footage of the wreck of *[El Faro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_El_Faro)* last night. The TOTE Ro/Ro was lost with all 33 aboard in Hurricane Joaquin in October. The footage is striking and grim. *El Faro*‘s upper two decks were ripped off during the sinking and were found a half mile from the ship itself, which sank in 15,0000 feet of water. The Vessel Data Recorder has not been found. The video and photographs were taken by the US Navy’s [CURV (Cable operated Unmanned Recovery Vehicle](http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=4300&tid=50&ct=4).)  The segment is generally well done, notwithstanding the unfortunate reference to the “Bermuda Triangle” and a few other questionable points.
