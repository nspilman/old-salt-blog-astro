![victorystern](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/victorystern.jpg)This week the BBC reported: *[Lord Nelson’s HMS Victory ‘collapsing’ under own weight](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-36254359)*.  Sadly, this is not a new story. Five years ago we posted about an extremely similar account in the Telegraph: *[HMS Victory rotting and being pulled apart under its own weight](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/hms-victory-rotting-and-being-pulled-apart-under-its-own-weight/)*.  Last year we also posted: [*HMS Victory at 250 Years Old — Last Chance to Save the Historic Ship?*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/01/hms-victory-at-250-years-old-last-chance-to-save-the-historic-ship/)  The 250-year-old ship was never designed to sit high and dry in a drydock and is subject to rot and weathering like any wooden vessel.

Fortunately, the problem is not being ignored. [HMS *Victory*](http://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/site-attractions/attractions/hms-victory), Lord Nelson’s flagship in the [Battle of Trafalgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar) in 1805, is undergoing a 13-year, £35m restoration. As part of the restoration, more than 130 metal supports are due to be fitted in the dry dock to stop the ship’s structure from deforming.

[Andrew Baines, head of historic ships at the National Museum of the Royal Navy, explained](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3584302/Lord-Nelson-s-flagship-HMS-Victory-collapsing-weight-line-squashed-footballl-needs-urgent-work-standing.html), “‘*The upper deck has been getting close to the keel at a rate that currently stands at around half a centimetre a year and as the upper deck moves down, the ship’s sides bulge out like squashing down on a football. The whole ship herself is falling very, very slowly backwards away from the bowsprit, the front end of the ship, and that was more or less all we knew back in March 2012*.” He nevertheless was adamant that the ship could “*absolutely be saved*“.

There is also a significant problem with rain water leaking into the ship and causing rot.  Baines also commented, “*The most important thing for us to do is work on the ship’s structure to stop water getting in, stop the rot and stop us losing any more really valuable historical material in the ship.*”
