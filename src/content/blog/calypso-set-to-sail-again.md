![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/03/calypso2.jpg)Big news from the [Cousteau Society](http://www.cousteau.org/calypso-set-to-sail-again/). They have announced: *As 2016 begins, [Calypso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Calypso) will be getting a whole new life, 20 years after its accident in Singapore! After having explored the possibility of a future for Captain Cousteau’s iconic ship in Monaco, a different solution has finally been found to save Calypso.*

If the announcement turns out to be accurate, this is a major reversal of fortune. Last summer, the headline in the New York Times was “[Once a Beloved French Symbol, Cousteau’s Ship Now Rusts In Oblivion.”](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/world/europe/once-a-beloved-french-symbol-a-ship-now-rusts-into-oblivion.html?_r=0)   Our post was no more optimistic — [Cousteau’s *Calypso* — Abandoned and Rotting](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/07/cousteaus-calypso-abandoned-and-rotting/).  After a court judgement over unpaid yard bills, the only likely alternative appeared to be the scrap yard for the venerable old research vessel made famous by Jacques Cousteau.

We can only wish the Cousteau Society good fortune in its efforts to return the *Calypso* to the sea.
