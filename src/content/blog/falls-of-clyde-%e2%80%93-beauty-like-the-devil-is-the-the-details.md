Falls of Clyde at the Dock

Susan Yamamato has been posting some wonderful photographs from aboard the [*Falls of Clyde*](http://www.friendsoffallsofclyde.org/home) on her blog, [Notes from the Wooden and Iron World](http://weeboopiper.wordpress.com/).    Beauty, like the devil, is often in the details.  [Click here to view the gallery](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/09/26/falls-of-clyde-beauty-like-the-devil-is-the-the-details/).

[*Falls of Clyde*](http://www.friendsoffallsofclyde.org/home) is the only surviving iron-hulled four-masted full rigged ship and the only surviving sail-driven oil tanker in the world.  She is currently berthed at Honolulu Harbor.
