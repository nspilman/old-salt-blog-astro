![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/05/flagship.jpg)Interesting news from the UK. Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, announced the [construction of a new national flagship](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-national-flagship-to-promote-british-businesses-around-the-world) intended to promote British businesses around the world. 

The Prime Minister said in the announcement:

*   This new national flagship will be the first vessel of its kind in the world, reflecting the UK’s burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation.
*   Every aspect of the ship, from its build to the businesses it showcases on board, will represent and promote the best of British – a clear and powerful symbol of our commitment to be an active player on the world stage.

The vessel will be the successor to the Royal Yacht *Britannia*, which was retired in 1997.

The government plans to build the ship in the UK, at a [reported cost of £200m](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57293882).

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-build-new-flagship-promote-trade-2021-05-29/) notes that a flagship to promote global trade has long been advocated by proponents of Brexit, who highlight the possibilities for new free trade agreements now Britain has left the European Union.

Critics, however, point to disruption to trade with the EU, Britain’s biggest export market, following the country’s departure from the EU’s orbit at the start of the year. 

Labour said the government must demonstrate clearly how the ship is expected to boost trade, jobs, and growth.

Construction is set to start as early as next year, with the ship expected to enter service within the next four years.

The vessel, which is set to be in service for about 30 years, will be part of the Royal Navy and crewed by it.

The name of the new flagship has yet to be announced, but the [Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/01/exclusive-britannia-rule-waves-new-royal-yacht-named-prince/) has suggested the ship will be named after the Duke of Edinburgh, who helped design *Britannia*.
