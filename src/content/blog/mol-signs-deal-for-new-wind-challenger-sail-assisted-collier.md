![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windchallengerc.jpg)Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. (MOL) has reached a coal transport deal with Tohoku Electric Power Co., Inc., which will use a [new 99,000 DWT collier equipped with a retractable wing sail](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/mol-tohoku-electric-power-sign-deal-for-transport-usingcoal-carrier-equippedwith-hard-sail-wind-power-propulsion-system-wind-challenger/) propulsion system, known as the Wind Challenger. Construction of the vessel will start at Oshima Shipbuilding with the goal of going into service in 2022.

The new ship will feature a single retractable sail, mounted near the bow, which is expected to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by about 5% on the Japan-Australia route or about 8% on the Japan-North America West Coast route, in comparison with a conventional vessel of the same class.

The [Wind Challenger](https://www.mol.co.jp/en/pr/2019/19065.html) design for retractable rigid sails began in 2009 as an industry-academia joint research project led by The University of Tokyo. MOL and Oshima Shipbuilding have been directly involved since 2018 and received “Approval In Principle (AIP)” from the classification society, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai, for the design of the rigid sail system last year.

While the new ship is designed to carry a single articulating sail, the Wind Challenger design can also be deployed on ships with multiple sails.
