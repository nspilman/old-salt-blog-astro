![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/11/maitre-coq-jeremie-beyou-r-.jpg)A week ago last Sunday, 20 boats sailed by 20 sailors set off in the [Vendée Globe](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/) non-stop round-the-world single-handed yacht race. Now only 15 remain in the race.  [Jérémie Beyou dropped out](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/news/article/3857/leaders-in-the-doldrums-as-beyou-starts-his-engine.html) yesterday after the hydraulic ram on his articulating keel broke on his Open 60 class boat, *Maître CoQ*.   Of the five boats that have dropped out, there have been two keel failures, a dismasting and damage related to two collisions with fishing boats.

Alex Thompson sailing *Hugo Boss* has stayed in the race despite damage to a rudder tie bar.  Thompson successfully  performed emergency repairs while underway and sailing at 18 knots. Zbigniew “Gutek” Gutkowski sailing *Energa*, is having autopilot problems and considering his options. In today’s radio call he commented, “*I’m very confused because the autopilot isn’t working. I’ve stopped and right now I’m fishing while I think about how to solve my problems. To be honest, right now, I have no idea what to do next.*“
