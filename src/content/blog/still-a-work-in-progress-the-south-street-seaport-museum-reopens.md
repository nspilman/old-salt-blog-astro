Last February, the chronically mismanaged Seaport Museum of New York (the ex-South Street Seaport Museum) laid off its staff and shut its doors. (See our post  [The Rise and Fall of the South Street Seaport Museum](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/19/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-south-street-seaport-museum/).)  Today, under new management, with new funding but with the same loyal cadre of volunteers and supporters, the [South Street Seaport Museum](http://www.seany.org/) is opening its doors once again. It is still very much a work in progress with considerable uncertainty regarding it is future, but the museum is back and has even reclaimed its original name.

The museum, which has been taken over by the [Museum of the City of New York](http://www.mcny.org/), is opening today with sixteen galleries, interweaving the sea and the city of New York with photography, video, historical artifacts and contemporary design.
