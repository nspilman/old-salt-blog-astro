![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/10/ussstout.jpg)The pandemic has taken a toll on even those of us who remained untouched by the virus. In a trivial example, for me, it was a haircut. After five months without a haircut, I was feeling very shaggy when the barbershops finally reopened.

The same applies to ships. The Arleigh Burke-class destroyer [*USS Stout*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Stout) remained at sea continuously for 215 days straight without a port call, in large part to stay isolated from the pandemic. And it showed. [The Drive.com](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37094/check-out-how-rusty-and-battered-uss-stout-looks-after-spending-a-record-215-days-at-sea#:~:text=This%20ship%20stayed%20at%20sea,battered%20from%20the%20hard%20deployment.) described the appearance of the ship looked “like a set from a dystopian naval thriller, streaked in rust, her hull dinged and battered from the hard deployment.”

The ship didn’t call on a single port between early March and her arrival in Rota, Spain on October 3rd. In that period of time, she spent her time escorting ships, including Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS *Bataan* (LHD-5) and the Nimitz class aircraft carriers USS *Dwight D. Eisenhower* (CVN-69) and USS *Nimitz* (CVN-68), as well as executing a slew of other tasks in the 2nd, 5th and 6th Fleets’ areas of responsibilities. In that time, *Stout* executed three dozen consecutive underway replenishment cycles and executed maintenance that is usually done in port, while remaining at sea. The Navy stated the following in a [release](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/380731/uss-stout-returns-deployment):

*“As COVID-19 made frequent port visits unsafe, Stout competed the first modern Mid-Deployment Voyage Repair (MDVR) period at sea, spending a week executing scheduled maintenance and preservation to maintain mission readiness while deployed. Throughout the deployment, Stout’s technicians executed depot-level repairs on vital engineering and combat systems equipment.”*
