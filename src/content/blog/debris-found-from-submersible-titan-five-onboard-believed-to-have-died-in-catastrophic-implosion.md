![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/06/titanpassengers.jpg)Pieces of the [*Titan*](https://oceangate.com/our-subs/titan-submersible.html) submersible were found today on the ocean floor, about 1,600 feet from the bow of the *[Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic).* The debris was ‘consistent with a catastrophic implosion,’ the Coast Guard says. All five onboard the submersible are believed to have died. The Canadian vessel [*Horizon Arctic*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:3804615/mmsi:316003140/imo:9732838/vessel:HORIZON_ARCTIC) deployed a remote-operated vehicle (ROV) that discovered the debris field.

“On behalf of the United States Coast Guard and the entire unified command, I offer my deepest condolences to the families,” Rear Admiral John Mauger said in a news conference on Thursday.

Mauger said that the tragedy likely occurred before the rescue effort got underway because sonar monitoring of the area had not detected any signs of an implosion during the search.

The operator of the craft, [OceanGate](https://oceangate.com/expeditions/titanic-survey-expedition.html), confirmed the five people onboard — its chief executive, Stockton Rush, who was piloting the submersible; Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British businessman-adventurer  Hamish Harding; and Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French explorer — are presumed dead.
