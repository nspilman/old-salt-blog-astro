![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/12/Kowloon_bridge.jpg)Twenty five years ago today, the ore-bulk-oil carrier [MV *Kowloon Bridge*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Kowloon_Bridge) sank off the coast of West Cork with a cargo of 165,000 tons of iron ore and 2,000 tons of bunker oil, becoming the world’s largest shipwreck by tonnage.

The *Kowloon Bridge* was bound from Quebec, Canada to the River Clyde,in Scotland when she started to develop structural cracking on the main deck during a storm. She diverted to Bantry Bay, Ireland.  She subsequently suffered  steering gear failre and on Monday, November 24th, 1986, ran around off ‘The Stags,’ near Baltimore, West Cork in the Republic of Ireland.  Attempts at salvage failed and on December 3, the ship broke in half and sank. The almost 2,000 tonnes of fuel oil which leaked from the wreck did significant damage to local beaches, fisheries and wildlife.  The *Kowloon Bridge* was a sistership to the MV *Derbyshire* which sank with all hands during Typhoon Orchid in 1980.
