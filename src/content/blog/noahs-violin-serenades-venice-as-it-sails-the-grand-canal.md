![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/noahsviolin.jpg)We recently posted [A Look at Venetian Gondolas — Designs New and Old](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/09/a-look-at-venetian-gondolas-designs-new-and-old/).  Here is a post about a very different watercraft that graced Venetian waters last weekend. Named [*Noah’s Violin*](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/20/1038931060/violin-boat-venice-grand-canal-artist-italy-pandemic), it is a 12-meter electric-powered giant floating violin, the work of Venetian artist and sculptor [Livio De Marchi](http://www.liviodemarchi.com/profile). It featured a string quartet performing an arrangement of Vivaldi’s ‘Spring’ from The Four Seasons as it sailed down the Grand Canal, escorted by a small fleet of gondolas, water taxis, and sandoli. The musicians played barefoot for better traction on the curved violin’s deck.

Starting near Venice’s city hall, the violin’s journey concluded at the Customs House, across from Piazza San Marco. The voyage went smoothly with only a minor hiccup when a music score was blown off a stand. It was quickly picked up from the water.

The stringed watercraft is intended to celebrate the post-pandemic recovery of Venice and its arts community, as well as to honor those who have died in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
