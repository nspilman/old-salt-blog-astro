Whale watchers off San Diego were shocked to see what appeared to be a [beluga whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_whale) in southern Californian waters. Video shot from a drone confirmed the sighting. Belugas typically live in the waters of the Arctic and sub-Arctic. This is believed to be the first beluga sighted so far south in the Pacific. 

Experts from Alaska said it appears to them that the whale did not escape from captivity, but instead is what they call an “explorer” who wandered off from a pod in the wild. The good news is that there is a lot of food for it in our water so, if it’s healthy, it definitely has a chance to survive, according to reporting by [CBS8](https://www.cbs8.com/article/life/animals/for-the-first-time-beluga-whale-spotted-off-coast-of-san-diego/509-09cf12df-7eab-48a1-8210-cf1195658d32).
