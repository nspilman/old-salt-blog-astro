The parbuckling of the cruise ship *Costa Concordia* is proceeding as intended after a three hour delay due to a thunderstorm. If all goes well, the process should take 10 hours to roll the ship upright from its current position, rolled 65 degrees over on its side off the island of Giglio. If successful, the operation will be the largest intact ship salvage in history.
