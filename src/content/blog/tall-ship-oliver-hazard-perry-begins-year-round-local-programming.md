![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ohpribanner.jpg)In February we posted that the tall ship [*Oliver Hazard Perry*](https://www.ohpri.org) was [entering drydock](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/02/tallship-oliver-hazard-perry-in-drydock-with-uncertain-future/) and that [the mission and strategy of](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/02/new-directions-for-ssv-oliver-hazard-perry-best-wishes-to-captain-kabak-ohpri/) [Oliver Hazard Perry Rhode Island](https://www.ohpri.org/) [(OHPRI), the organization operating the ship, was being reconsidered](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/02/new-directions-for-ssv-oliver-hazard-perry-best-wishes-to-captain-kabak-ohpri/). Rather than focussing on distance sailing, Rhode Island’s Official Tall Ship would be used in year-round programming closer to home. OHPRI announced that the new operating model will pivot away from long offshore voyages that impact the fewest people at the greatest capital expense. Operations will consist of a mix of multi-day, single day and dockside programs, with underway voyages offered from late spring through mid-autumn.

OHPRI wasted no time to test the concept of the new model. With the ship in winter shipyard layup, they provided a program of six days of hands-on experience to nine participants in the [Rhode Island Marine Trade Association](http://rimta.org/)’s (RIMTA) Pre-Apprenticeship Program.”

“Partnering for the first time with OHPRI has allowed the RIMTA Marine Trades Core Training Program to introduce its participants to an array of industry-specific training topics that will provide them with employable skills” said RIMTA Executive Director Brian Dursi. “While the ship is undergoing maintenance during a yard period, the students are learning about marine coatings, propulsion systems, hydraulics, AC/DC wiring, rigging and safety. This has been a great opportunity to utilize the resources of Rhode Island’s Official Tall Ship to introduce Rhode Islanders to the career opportunities in the marine industry within the state.

Program participants were identified through Skills for Rhode Island’s Future and received training both aboard *OHP* and at the Community College of Rhode Island’s Newport Campus. Contributing greatly to the student experience was the opportunity to utilize quality marine industry products generously donated by Jamestown Distributors.

“We are thrilled that we are not only piloting a new way forward for *OHP* but also contributing to the prosperity and successes of Rhode Islanders,” said OHPRI CEO Captain Jonathan Kabak.
