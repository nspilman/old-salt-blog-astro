They also reminded us that on this day in 1797, the *[USS Constitution](http://www.history.navy.mil/ussconstitution/)* was launched at Hartt’s Shipyard, in Boston, Massachusetts.  The *Constitution* is the oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy. She is also the  world’s oldest floating commissioned naval vessel.  
  
Nelson’s HMS *Victory*, from which he fought and died in the Battle of Trafalgar,  is the oldest commissioned warship in the world, being 30 years older than the *Constitution*.  The *Victory* however is on permanent exhibit in a drydock in Portsmouth, so she is no longer afloat, allowing the Constitution to claim the title of the oldest floating commissioned naval vessel.  The *Constitution* earned its nickname, “Old Ironsides,”  after round shot from HMS *Guerriere* bounced off her sides in a battle during the War 1812.
