![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/frankw.jpg)I was stunned and saddened to read that shanty singer and folklorist [Frank Woerner](https://www.facebook.com/frank.woerner.3) has died. I haven’t seen an obituary yet, but I came across a Facebook post by Alison Kelley who wrote, “It is with great shock and sorrow that my dear friend and folk father Frank Woerner has passed away suddenly.”

I first encountered Frank in the last quarter of the previous century when I had a summer job in New York CIty. On Thursday evenings, if my memory serves, there was a weekly free shanty concert featuring Bernie Clay and the X-Seamen’s Institute, at the South Street Seaport. A small crowd sat on the rotting planks of Pier 17, jutting out into the East River as they sang shanties and sea songs.  Frank Woerner was one of the X-Seamen, along with Bernie Clay, John Townley, and Dan Aguiar.

Decades later, I crossed paths with Frank again at monthly shanty sings at the Seaman’s Church and then at the [William Main Doerflinger Memorial Sea Shanty Sessions](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/09/the-william-main-doerflinger-memorial-sea-shanty-sessions/) at [Sailors’ Snug Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailors%27_Snug_Harbor) in Staten Island. He always had a spring in his step, a twinkle in his eye, a wry smile, and a quick wit. When he led the singing his voice was strong and evocative. In a canvas shirt, with his trademark sailor’s queue, when he raised his voice it was easy to imagine that he was a shantyman of old.

The best way to honor Frank Woerner may be the way so many will remember him, in song. Through the magic of video and YouTube, we have Frank, once again, to lead us in the singing.  Here are three songs led by Frank. The first, “The Life of a Leaf” feels especially apt, with its chorus:

*What’s the life of a man any more than a leaf?*  
*Life has its seasons, so why should there be grief?*  
*Though in this wide world, we appear fine and gay*  
*Like a leaf we shall wither and soon fade away.*

And so, when we fathom the bowl, let’s raise our glasses to Frank Woerner. He will be missed.
