About a year ago, I saw what appeared to be a man standing up in the middle of the Hudson River. That is about all I could see.  He appeared to making a sweeping motion with his hands and arms and looked to be holding a broom stick of some sort.  As he got closer I could see that he was standing on a rather wide surf board and the  broomstick was a paddle. He was paddling standing up, which to a kayaker like myself seemed both tiring and a bit perilous.

Now it appears that SUP, stand-up paddling, has hit the mainstream. Both the [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703720504575377023651849234.html) and the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/sports/20surfer.html?scp=3&sq=stand%20up%20paddling&st=cse) (twice) have featured SUP in articles within the last several weeks.  The sport has its own [magazine](http://www.supsurfmag.com/), [books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D9%26ref_%3Dnb%5Fsb%5Fnoss%26fsc%3D-1%26ih%3D1%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F1.1483%5F57%26y%3D18%26field-keywords%3Dstand%2520up%2520paddle%2520board%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Dstripbooks&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957), [DVD](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WCKDIU?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000WCKDIU)s and of course, [lots of gear](ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D11%26ref_%3Dnb%5Fsb%5Fnoss%26fsc%3D-1%26y%3D20%26field-keywords%3Dstand%2520up%2520paddleboard%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Dsporting&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957).  It all still looks a bit odd to a SDP (Sitting Down Paddler) like me, but it is intriguing nevertheless.
