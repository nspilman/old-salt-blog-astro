Crew of the RFA Argus celebrating 75 years since VE day.

Parades and large celebrations were planned for the 75th anniversary of VE Day, [Victory in Europe Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day), the end of World War II in Europe on this day in 1945. And then the pandemic came along. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy has found ways to commemorate and celebrate the anniversary with [silence, sound, and light](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2020/may/07/200507-rn-tribute-for-ve-day-75). 

*   At 11 AM GMT, they observed 2 minutes’ silence to remember the sacrifices made between 1939 and 1945.
*   At 3 PM GMT Royal Navy warships and support vessels of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary at home and deployed around the world blasted their horns for a minute to celebrate victory.
*   At 9.30 PM GMT, naval ships will redirect their searchlights skywards to form ‘V for victory’ beams for five minutes.

Here is a short video of a “Virtual VE Day 75 Festival” by [The National Museum of the Royal Navy](https://www.nmrn.org.uk/):
