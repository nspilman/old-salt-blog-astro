![vendeewin](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/vendeewin.jpg)[François Gabart](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/news/article/11391/francois-gabart-a-long-and-constant-effort.html), sailing *MACIF*, won the [Vendée Globe](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/) round-the-world single-handed race in 78 days and two hours, shattering the previous record of 84 days and three hours, set in 2009 by Michel Desjoyeaux.   Ending what has been a round-the-world match-race between the two fastest boats, [Armel Le Cléac’h](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/news/article/11403/armel-le-cleac-h-banque-populaire-second-of-the-2012-2013-vendee-globe.html), sailing *Banque Populaire*, crossed the finish line a mere 3 hours 17 minutes 12 seconds behind Gabart, to claim second place.  This is the closest finish between the first and second place boats in the history of the Vendée Globe.

Britain’s [Alex Thomson](http://www.alexthomsonracing.com/), sailing *Hugo Boss*, is expected to arrive on Monday or Tuesday to claim third place.  After [Jean-Pierre Dick](http://www.jpdick.com/) lost his keel in the north Atlantic last week, Thomson diverted to offer assistance.  Dick has remained in the race and is currently in fourth place. The remaining fleet of eight boats range from Jean Le Cam, sailing SynerCiel, who is roughly 2,500 NM from the finish line to Alessandro Di Benedetto, on Team Plastique, who still has around 4,700 NM to sail.
