A woman scheduled to be married in two weeks was killed on on Friday night around 10PM, when the 21′ long Stingray speedboat she was aboard hit a construction barge anchored off the [Tappan Zee bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tappan_Zee_Bridge) in the Hudson River, 13 miles north of New York City.  Lindsey Stewart, 30, was thrown from the boat in the collision. Her body was recovered on Saturday.  Her fiancé, Brian Bond, 35, suffered head injuries and is reported to be in fair condition at a local medical center.   Mark Lennon, 30, who was to be Bond’s best man, was also thrown from the boat, and remains missing.  Three others who were not thrown from the boat were also hospitalized for head injures.

The operator of the boat, Jojo K. John, 35, was arraigned at an area hospital on one count of first-degree vehicular manslaughter and three counts of second-degree vehicular assault.  “We have probable cause to believe that he operated the boat while intoxicated,” said Robert Van Cura, undersheriff of the Rockland County Sheriff’s Office.
