![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/05/biceberg_0523.jpg)About a year ago, we posted [Towing Icebergs – an Idea Whose Time is Still Coming?](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/01/towing-icebergs-an-idea-whose-time-is-still-coming/), where we pointed out that the latest proposal to tow icebergs from the Arctic or Antarctic to supply fresh water, was similar to plans that dated from the late 1970s.   We should have gone much father back. [Alexis Madrigal](http://www.theatlantic.com/alexis-madrigal/), writing in the [Atlantic Monthly](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/the-many-failures-and-few-successes-of-zany-iceberg-towing-schemes/243364/), describes the various schemes and dreams of moving bergs at least through 1825. Most of these schemes were failures, but not all.  My favorite was an apparently successful venture towing small icebergs from southern Chile to Valparaiso to provide refrigeration to local breweries. “*Sometimes the icebergs were supplied with sails to utilize the prevailing winds.*”  Thanks to Phil Leon for pointing out the article.
