**Update:** from the *Bounty* [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HMSBounty) 7:10 AM **–**  *At 0430 today the Captain ordered all hands to abandon ship. There are 17 Crew on board and at this moment all crew are accounted for and are in Life rafts.   The first USCG helicopter has reached the ship and is in the process of rescuing them. Bounty is currently still floating upright and intact.*

Terrible news. The 180-foot, three mast tall ship, [HMS *Bounty*](http://www.tallshipbounty.org/) is reported to be in distress and the crew of 17 is reported to have abandoned ship, approximately 160 miles west of the eye of Hurricane Sandy in 35 knot winds and 18 foot seas.

After apparently successfully crossing the path of Hurricane Sandy yesterday, there were reports yesterday afternoon that a generator aboard ship had failed.  The [*Bounty*‘s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HMSBounty?fref=ts) said that the ship was “taking on more water than they would like.”  Late Sunday, the ship’s owners lost contact with the ship and notified the Coast Guard.  [Subsequently, the Coast Guard picked up an EPIRB distress signal](http://www.uscgnews.com/go/doc/4007/1591447/Coast-Guard-responds-to-vessel-in-distress-160-miles-from-hurricane-s-center) from the ship.  An air crew from Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City launched aboard an HC-130 Hercules aircraft, which later arrived on scene and reestablished communications with the Bounty’s crew.

*Lt. Junior Grade Brendan Salerno, with the U.S. Coast Guard, told CBC News the 17-member crew of the tall ship HMS Bounty had decided to abandon ship after getting caught in 5.5-metre seas off Cape Hatteras.*

*“We have a Coast Guard Hercules C-130 aircraft on scene with the vessel. Right now the vessel has decided to abandon ship so right now we’re working on rescue ideas,” Salerno said Monday.*

*“We’re trying to get one of our cutters underway and we’re sending out some of our helicopters to try and get people that way as well.”*

*Salerno said the winds in the area are sustained in the 75 kilometre per hour range.*
