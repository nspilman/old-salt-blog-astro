An underwater expedition led by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos successfully recovered the mangled wreckage of two rocket engines from NASA’s Apollo Moon program from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The F-1 engines, which powered the first-stage Saturn V boosters that fell back to Earth after their fuel was depleted, were found at a depth of 14,000 feet, Bezos’ expedition announced Wednesday. NASA will not try to determine on which Apollo mission the rocket engines were used. Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) and Tony Seideman for passing the news along.
