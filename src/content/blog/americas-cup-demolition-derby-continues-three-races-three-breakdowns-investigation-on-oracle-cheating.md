In each of the first three races of the the Louis Vuitton finals to determine which challenger will compete for the America’s Cup, the race has been decided by mechanical failure.  The series now stands with Emirates Team New Zealand, 2 and the Italian team, *Luna Rossa*, 1. In Race 1, the Italians’ daggerboard failed.  The Kiwi boat was also damaged but crossed the finish line.  In Race 2, the Kiwis lost their electrical system and hydraulics and had to pull out of the race, while a broken wing control scuppered the Italians in Race 3.  Emirates Team New Zealand Captain Dean Barker is quoted as saying, “It’d be nice if we can get one race where both boats race all the way till the end.”  Wouldn’t it though.

[In other America’s Cup foolishness:](http://www.marinij.com/sports/ci_23897626/americas-cup-emirates-grabs-2-1-lead-over) *The American team, owned by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, has been branded as cheaters by the two remaining challengers after it was found that two of its three prototype boats used in warm-up regattas last year and early this year were illegally modified. An international jury is investigating and could sanction Oracle with a fine, forfeiture of races in the America’s Cup match or disqualification.*

*The jury issued notices Monday morning that it is moving forward with the investigation but said it would not announce the date of the hearing, though Sirena said he heard it would be held next week. America’s Cup CEO Stephen Barclay said he expects a decision by the end of the month.*
