[‘Gribble’ marine pest may be key to biofuel breakthrough, say scientists](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/earth-environment/article7054684.ece)

*A marine pest could be the key to a biofuel breakthrough, say scientists. Gribble, which resemble pink woodlice, plagued seafarers for centuries by boring through the planks of ships and destroying wooden piers.  But now environmental scientists are taking a keen interest in the crustaceans.*

*A team of British researchers has learnt that gribble have a gift for digesting wood not seen in any other animal.  Enzymes produced by the tiny creatures are able to break down woody cellulose and turn it into energy-rich sugars meaning that gribble could convert wood and straw into liquid biofuel.  A gribble-like processing plant could make sugars from woody raw material that can be fermented into alcohol-based fuels for vehicle engines.*
