What is AMVER?  They are the most amazing world-wide maritime search and rescue network that you probably have never heard of.  AMVER stands for the Automated Mutual Assistance Vessel Rescue System. It was founded over fifty years ago, in 1958, and currently over 19,000 ships are enrolled.  How does it work?  The ships, which voluntarily enroll in AMVER, report their positions on a regular basis.  When an distress call is received, often by a triggered EPIRB,  AMVER calculates the closest ships to the vessel in distress and vectors them to the stricken vessel.

Just last week an [AMVER enrolled vessel, *Sunbelt Spirit*, diverted toward an EPIRB signal](http://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/823/970715/?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed) and picked up two Canadian men  in a liferaft off the coast of Nicaragua in a joint SAR operation with the US Coast Guard.   Roughly two weeks ago the AMVER enrolled container ship CGA-CGM *La Scala* rescued four sailors from a capsized sailboat one thousand miles east-southeast of Bermuda.  (There is a video of the *La Scala* rescue after the jump.)
