![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/03/800px-New_Jersey_Sails.jpg)Retirement has not been easy for the [Battleship New Jersey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_New_Jersey_\(BB-62\)). After serving with distinction for 45 years in World War II, the Korean Conflict and the War in Vietnam, the highly decorated battleship became a museum ship in Camden, New Jersey in October 2000.  It has been plagued by chronic financial problems, and was almost [forced to close in the summer of 2010](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/19/trouble-on-the-delaware-three-historic-ships-at-risk/).  Last year, the [State of New Jersey cut its operating subsidy from $1.7 million](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/08/26/will-a-governors-pen-sink-the-battleship-uss-new-jersey/) to only $32,000.  The ship’s operator, the [Home Port Alliance](http://www.battleshipnewjersey.org/), is now struggling to repay $900,000 remaining on a $1 million bank loan from 2003, while state officials are reviewing its finances.

A rival group, the USS New Jersey Battleship Foundation, is now lobbying to bring the battleship to New York Harbor.  The nonprofit is working to raise $15 million from donors to dredge a site at Liberty State Park, between Jersey City and Bayonne, and to move the ship there.  Their plan is, however, opposed by the grassroots organization, [Friends of Liberty State Park](http://www.folsp.org/index.htm), which argues that the park lacks the infrastructure and access to support the volume of tourists likely to be attracted by the battleship.
