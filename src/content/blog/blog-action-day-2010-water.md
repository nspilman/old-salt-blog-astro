Tomorrow is [International Blog Action Day](http://blogactionday.change.org/), when bloggers around the world get together to blog about a common theme.  This year that theme is clean water.  Will a few thousand, or even hundreds of thousands, of the chattering class posting about clean water do any real magic? Somehow, I am skeptical.  Then again, can it do any harm? Probably not.
