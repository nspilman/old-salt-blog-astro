![lilacvents](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/02/lilacvents.jpg)*[$9.99 with Dave Evans](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/media/shows/9-9-9.page)* is a weekly program which explores fun things to do and see in New York City for under ten bucks. Recently, he stopped by the [ex-USCG Cutter *Lilac*](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/) at Pier 25 in Manhattan on the Hudson River. *Lilac*, built in 1933, is America’s only steam-powered lighthouse tender. She once carried supplies to lighthouses and maintained buoys for the U.S. Lighthouse Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Decommissioned in 1972, USCGC *Lilac* is now a museum ship owned by the non-profit [Lilac Preservation Project](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/). *Lilac* is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is eligible to become a National Historic Landmark.
