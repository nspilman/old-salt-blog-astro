[Couple’s precious holiday snaps recovered intact from the bottom of the Atlantic… 16 months after digital camera was dropped overboard from QM2](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1250270/Couples-holiday-pictures-recovered-fishing-net-16-months-camera-dropped-cruise-ship.html)

*When Dennis and Barbara Gregory accidentally dropped their digital camera over the side of the Queen Mary 2 cruise ship in the middle of the Atlantic, they thought their holiday snaps were gone for ever.  But 16 months later the couple have been reunited with the pictures after a Spanish fisherman found the camera in his nets.   Amazingly, trawlerman Benito Estevez discovered there were five images still intact on the Nikon’s memory card.*
