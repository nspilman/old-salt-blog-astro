[Joshua Slocum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Slocum) was born on February 20, 1844.  After a career at sea, he rebuilt a 36′ 9″ (11.2 m) gaff rigged oyster boat, which he named *Spray*.   Between 1895 and 1898, he sailed the *Spray* singlehanded around the world, the first to ever sail around the world alone.  In 1900, he wrote the sailing classic, [*Sailing Alone Around the World*](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-enotated-sailing-alone-around-the-world-joshua-slocum/1105281775?ean=2940013091146), which became an international best-seller. He disappeared in November 1909 while aboard the Spray.  A very well done documentary of his life :
