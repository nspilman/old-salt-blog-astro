Sad news. On Friday, the 49.5-meter schooner [*Eleonora E*](https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/the-superyacht-directory/eleonora-e--42501) was struck by a 60′ long search and rescue vessel in Port Tárraco, Tarragona, Spain and subsequently sank. The search and rescue vessel *Punta Mayor* was maneuvering in the harbor and became stuck in reverse. The vessel struck *Eleonora E* at midships on the starboard side, crushing the schooner against a seawall. 

Built in 2000, at the Van der Graaf shipyard in Holland, *Eleonora E* is a replica of the Herreshoff-designed Westward, one of the most famous racing schooners in the world which raced against yachts such as *Britannia* and *Lulworth* in the early 1900s.

Drone photos taken following the collision show the schooner rolled over on her starboard side, completely submerged, with just the tip of the masts above water. Salvage operations are reported to be ongoing.

[Yachting World](https://www.yachtingworld.com/all-latest-posts/giant-schooner-eleonora-sunk-after-after-being-struck-by-ship-138906) reports that *Eleonora E* underwent a major refit in 2014 and was listed for sale at £6.9million. Around 160ft long from sprit to stern, when sailing, the yacht carries some 12,000sq ft of sail on the two gaff masts. It sleeps eight guests and four crew in a traditionally styled interior, and comes complete with two classic wooden tenders – one motor, one rowing, both clinker built to the original Herreshoff designs.
