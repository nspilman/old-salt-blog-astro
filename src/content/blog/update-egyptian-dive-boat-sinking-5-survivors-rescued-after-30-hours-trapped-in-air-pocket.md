![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/11/seastory2.jpg)After the Egyptian liveaboard dive boat, [*Sea Story*, capsized and sank in heavy weather in the Red Sea](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2024/11/egyptian-liveaboard-dive-boat-sinks-in-red-sea-sixteen-missing/) early Monday morning, 28 of the 44 passengers and crew were rescued. On Tuesday, divers rescued five additional survivors trapped in air pockets for roughly 30 hours within the sunken boat.

The rescue divers also recovered four dead bodies from the boat. Seven passengers or crew remain missing.  

“We dived 12m (40ft) underwater – the survivors were trapped inside the boat cabins,” Mr Khattab al-Faramawy told the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e7x9v190zo).  
   
Mr al-Faramawy described the complexities of searching the submerged four-deck boat to find passengers and crew.

“We were using torch lights to try to find our way into the darkness, it was quite a complicated mission,” he said.

Eventually, they were able to open cabin doors to get survivors out.

His own nephew was among them. Youssef, 23, worked as a diving instructor on board the boat.

Officials have not yet disclosed the identities of the victims and missing. The BBC understands two of the missing are British nationals.
