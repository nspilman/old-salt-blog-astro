![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Prowler42.jpg)Last year, I went to the [New York Boat Show](http://www.nyboatshow.com/), held yearly at the Javits Center in Manhattan. I found the visit to be frankly depressing. The endless rows of cookie cutter power boats, that often seemed as tall as they were long, was disheartening, to say the least.  The amount of fuel these ugly ducklings would burn is bad enough, but more than anything, I was struck with the hope that many of these towering craft might never leave the dock, as they looked downright dangerous.

I recently came across yacht designer [Tad Roberts](http://www.tadroberts.ca/)‘ blog, [Low Tide](http://blog.tadroberts.ca/2011/11/the-typical-powerboat-is-not-seaworthy/).  He has posted a refreshingly straight-forward persepctive on the lack of seaworthiness of so many of today’s production powerboats:

[THE TYPICAL POWERBOAT IS NOT SEAWORTHY](http://blog.tadroberts.ca/2011/11/the-typical-powerboat-is-not-seaworthy/)   
  
*The typical production powerboat is far from seaworthy in even slightly adverse conditions. Above is a Cooper Prowler 42′ which is typical of boats intended to sell at boatshows because of impressive interior volume. These boats are huge inside for their length by being high off the water and beamy, both detrimental to seaworthiness.*

*Note a great deal of boat above waterline and very little below….This boat is not designed for heavy weather! In my opinion this boat is a textbook case of unseaworthiness. Note the flat and shallow bottom, blunt bow, tiny rudders and props, and no keel at all. Also note the huge windows well forward (where they are vulnerable to waves coming over the bow), low freeboard at the bow, and engine room vents below the sheer in the hull side (easily flooded).*

*As long as you can keep the speed up (at least 10-12 knots) this boat will be reasonably controllable and have adequate dynamic stability. In a big sea where you have to slow down she will make everybody sick with her fast rolling, plus wear you out trying to keep her pointed into the waves. The combination of tiny rudders, no keel (for directional stability), and very high windage will keep her out of control. Loose power and you are in real trouble.*

*She will probably be fine for inland cruising, but I would not recommend this type for any open water passages.*
