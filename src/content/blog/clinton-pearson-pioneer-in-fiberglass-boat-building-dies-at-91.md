![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/04/clintonpearson.jpg)Clinton J. Pearson, a pioneer in building fiberglass yachts, passed away on April 4, 2020, at the age of 91.

With his cousin, [Everett Pearson](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/01/everett-pearson-founding-father-fiberglass/), Clinton began building fiberglass dinghies in their garage in Seekonk, MA in 1955. The venture would grow into  [Pearson Yachts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_Yachts). Their first auxiliary sailboat, the [Triton 28,](http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=508) was launched at the New York Boat Show of 1959 and was an immediate success. The company grew rapidly and in 1961 was acquired by Grumman Allied Industries.

Clinton Pearson left his namesake firm in 1964 and bought the struggling sailboat-builder, Sailstar, which he renamed [Bristol Yacht Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Yachts) in 1966. The company operated until 1997 and built more than 4,400 yachts. Between Pearson and Bristol, Clinton Pearson is credited with the construction of over 20,000 yachts.

From [EastBayRI.com](https://www.eastbayri.com/stories/clinton-j-pearson-91-of-bristol,79379): Born in Pawtucket, R.I., on March 6, 1929, he attended school in Pawtucket and graduated from Pawtucket High School in 1947. He attended and graduated from Brown University as part of the Navy ROTC. Clinton served in the U.S. Navy, as a midshipman aboard the USS Missouri and then with an officer’s commission aboard the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. …

In 1959 he married his lifelong love, Carolyn, and they made their home in Bristol. He was honored as the Chief Marshall of the Bristol Fourth of July Celebration in 1961.

In addition to his wife, he is survived by four children, Lisa and Dr. Thomas Enright of Bristol, Rhode Island, Joshua Pearson and Kimberly Gastle of Toronto, Canada, Dana and Teresa Pearson of Providence, Rhode Island and Martha and Kevin Handley of Bristol, Rhode Island; a sister, Marilyn Walton of Satellite Beach, Florida; ten grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. He was pre-deceased by a granddaughter.
