“The Grand Turk is a fully-rigged ship – complete with twelve smooth-bored cannon – built in Marmaris, Turkey based on the 18th Century, British, Sixth Rate Frigate, HMS Phoenix, built in 1741. Naval Architect Ron Holland took the historical lines and created working drawings.

She was launched in August 1997. Construction is Iroko and Mahogany but, unlike her predecessor, she has twin Kelvin TAS8 (400BHP) main engines , a bow thruster and 4 AC Generators.
