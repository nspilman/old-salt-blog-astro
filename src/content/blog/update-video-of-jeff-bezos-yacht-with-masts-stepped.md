Last week, we [posted about how the 417-foot-long, three-masted sailing yacht](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/08/update-jeff-bezos-yacht-towed-out-of-shipyard-under-cover-of-darkness/) built for billionaire Jeff Bezos was towed out of the [Oceanco shipyard](https://www.oceancoyacht.com/) in Rotterdam under the cover of darkness and moved to a shipyard in Greenport. The three masts were moved separately by barge. The yacht had been the center of months of controversy after the shipyard wanted to dismantle the center span of a historic railroad bridge to allow the yacht to access the North Sea. The superyacht with her masts stepped has too great an air draft to safely fit beneath the Koningshaven Bridge, known locally as [De Hef](https://www.bridgeinfo.net/bridge/index.php?ID=27).

Here is a video by [Dutch Yachting](https://www.youtube.com/c/DutchYachting) of the yacht with the three masts stepped. From the Dutch Yachting:

*As you might know, Jeff Bezos’s controversial Y721 yacht arrived at Greenport in Rotterdam without her masts last Tuesday. The fore, main and mizzen mast of the 127m/ 417ft schooner were transported and stepped last week, so we took the opportunity to have a closer look at Holland’s largest yacht and the World’s largest sailing yacht by boat yesterday. Footage by The Nautical Lady & Dutch Yachting.*
