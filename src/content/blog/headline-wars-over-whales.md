![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/whaling.jpg)There is an interesting conflict going on over the [new draft proposal by the International Whaling Commission](http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/IWC62docs/62-7.pdf) which would allow limited commercial  whaling at levels significantly lower than currently practiced by Japan, Iceland and Norway.   Depending on who you listen to this is either a good thing – decreased levels of whaling or a very bad thing – continued whaling.    The coverage of the story reflects the divide. CNN reported – [Proposal could save thousands of whales](http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/23/proposal-could-save-thousands-of-whales/).  The  Telegraph took the other side – [Endangered whales could be killed legally](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/7624474/Endangered-whales-could-be-killed-legally.html).    In the end, it may not matter, as thus far, the Japanese are rejecting the  proposal.
