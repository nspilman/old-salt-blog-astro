The last time the expedition cruise ship [*Coral Adventurer*](https://www.coralexpeditions.com/vessel/coral-adventurer) was in the news was in October, when the ship sailed from [Lizard Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard_Island) on the Great Barrier Reef, leaving Suzanne Rees, an 80-year-old passenger, behind on the remote island, where she died. A [major search operation found her body the following day](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2025/11/passenger-on-expedition-cruise-ship-dies-after-being-left-behind-on-remote-island/#more-62886). An investigation is underway in Ms. Rees’ death.

Now the [ship has run aground](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9z1k4g40jo) off the eastern coast of Papua New Guinea on its first trip since the death of the elderly passenger. The vessel, which had been carrying 80 passengers and 44 crew when it ran aground, remained on a reef off the coast, about 30km from PNG’s second-largest city, Lae, on Monday. All passengers and crew aboard the cruise ship have been reported safe. All passengers are set to be flown home early.
