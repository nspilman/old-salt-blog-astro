![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/saildrone.jpg)In January 2014, we posted [Saildrone Sails the Pacific](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/01/saildrone-sails-the-pacific/), about a 19′ long by 7′ wide autonomous trimaran sailing drone capable of carrying an oceanographic sensor payload of 220 pounds.  In October of 2013, Saildrone-1 set off from San Francisco and arrived 34 days later in Kaneohe, Hawaii.  This summer, [two Saildrones have been sailing in the challenging conditions in the Bering Sea](http://klcc.org/post/strange-orange-robots-sail-alaskan-harbor-just-what-are-they). Two drones were launched from Dutch Harbor, Alaska in the Aleutian Islands. They sailed to St. Paul, then up through the Bering Sea up to Nome, then Norton Sound, mapping the Yukon delta. Then they sailed back to Dutch Harbor, a distance of 4,500 miles.  [The ongoing development of Saildrones is a collaboration among researchers](http://research.noaa.gov/News/NewsArchive/LatestNews/TabId/684/ArtMID/1768/ArticleID/11135/For-the-first-time-Saildrones-explore-the-Bering-Sea-.aspx) at NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL), the Joint Institute for the Study of Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) at the University of Washington, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and [Saildrone Inc](http://www.saildrone.com/).
