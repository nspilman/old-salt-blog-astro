NYK Yamatai

Two years ago, an article appeared in *Scientific American*, [Slippery Ships That Float on Air](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=air-cavity-system), describing the various attempts to reduce frictional resistance on ship’s hulls by injecting air bubbles or introducing pockets of air beneath the hull.  At the time, the research looked promising but had failed to develop a fully practical technique.

Now [Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd](http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/news/story/1010141379.html) may have gotten closer to getting it right.  Earlier this year they launched the NYK-Hinode Line heavy lift ship/module carrier *[Yamatai](http://www.nyk.com/english/release/788/NE_100326.html)* [equipped with the the proprietary Mitsubishi Air Lubrication System (MALS)](http://www.nyk.com/english/release/788/NE_100326.html) designed to reduce frictional resistance by injecting air bubbles beneath the hull.   The *Yamatai* is the the world’s first application of an air-blow type air lubrication system on an ocean-going vessel for permanent use.    Testing is now ongoing.  
  
MHI has recently developed a concept design for a 14,000 TEU containership with 35 percent lower CO2 emissions as compared with container carriers of conventional design.  Of that reduction, the MALS is expected to contribute 10% to reduction in the overall in fuel costs and emissions.  Other features including an advanced hull form and improved propulsions system and layout  result in the remainder of the the savings.
