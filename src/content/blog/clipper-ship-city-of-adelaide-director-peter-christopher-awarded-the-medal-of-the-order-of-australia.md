Congratulations to [Clipper Ship City of Adelaide](https://www.cityofadelaide.org.au/) Director [Peter Christopher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-christopher-1b6498196/?originalSubdomain=au), on being awarded the  [Medal of the Order of Australia](https://www.pmc.gov.au/honours-and-symbols/list-australian-honours/medal-order-australia#:~:text=The%20design%20of%20the%20Medal,the%20Crown%20of%20St%20Edward.) for his services to Maritime History.

Peter Christopher convened the first meeting of Adelaide volunteers to save the [*City of Adelaide*](https://www.cityofadelaide.org.au/about) in July 2000 and worked tirelessly since in the preservation and restoration of this important piece of maritime history.  His vision and dedication continue to be a driving force in the planned [Seaport Village project at Dock 2, Port Adelaide](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/09/deal-reached-for-clipper-ship-city-of-adelaide-seaport-village-at-dock-two/).

Peter Christopher is also the author of 7 books on shipwrecks and riverboats, and co-author of another 2.

He served as the Public Sector Union (SA) state secretary and chief industrial officer for the Public Service Association of South Australia (1992-2015).

The *City of Adelaide* is the world’s oldest surviving clipper ship and one of only two remaining composite clipper ships. She was built in 1864, in Sunderland, England by William Pile, Hay and Co. for transporting passengers and goods between Britain and Australia. Between 1864 and 1887 the ship made 23 annual return voyages from London and Plymouth to Adelaide, South Australia. After a long and varied career, the *City of Adelaide* has returned to her namesake city due to the tireless efforts of Peter Christopher and his team.

A short documentary by Tasha Trebeck featuring Peter Christopher and other Clipper Ship City of Adelaide organization founders.
