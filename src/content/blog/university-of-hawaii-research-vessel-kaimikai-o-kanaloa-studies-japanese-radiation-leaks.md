*“Basically, they’ll provide a baseline for where the radioactive material is now at very low concentrations and how it may disperse across the Pacific,” said Alexander Shor, associate dean for research at UH Manoa’s School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology.*

*The researchers are collecting water and biological samples. They’re also measuring ocean currents.*

*“We want to learn how it affects us people, how big of a health risk it is, and second, it’s important to learn about the ocean, how currents behave and how they spread radioactive material,” explained Henrieta Dulaiova, an assistant professor in UH Manoa’s Department of Geology and Geophysics.*
