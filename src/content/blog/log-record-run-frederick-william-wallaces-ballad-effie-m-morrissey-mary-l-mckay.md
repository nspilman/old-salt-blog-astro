![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/06/morrissey3.jpg)One last post (at least for the immediate future) on the historic schooner *[Ernestina-Morrissey](http://www.ernestina.org/),* which is now being restored in Boothbay, Maine.  Launched in February, 1894, she had a very successful almost thirty year fishing career, before becoming an Arctic exploration ship and then a Cape Verdian packet schooner.  

On December 10, 1912, the journalist, photographer, historian and novelist, [Frederick William Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William_Wallace), boarded the *Effie M. Morrissey* for a record breaking voyage from Portland, ME and Yarmouth, NS, covering a distance of 200 miles in 20 hours.  Wallace would later pen a ballad “*The Log of the Record Run*.”  The song is now best known as “*The Mary L. McKay*.” [Wallace explains why he changed the name](http://www.ernestina.org/download/?did=42) of the schooner in the song:

*“Some time afterwards I composed a string of verses recounting the incidents of this trip. Under the title of “The Log of a Record Run” it was printed in the Canadian Fisherman in 1914. It was just a “Come-all-ye” doggerel, but it must have appealed to some of the East Coast fishermen for one of them picked it up and put a tune to it and it got spread around. Years later it was included in a collection of Nova Scotia ballads compiled by Miss Helen Creighton who was under the impression that it was an old-time composition. In the verses, I altered the name of the schooner to Mary L. Mackay as I was afraid that to put Effie Morrissey in them might incur the displeasure of my shipmates. However, I need not have worried on that score for most, if not all of them, would have been delighted to have been identified with the escapade – so I was told”.*
