![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sub1.jpg)The [prospect of women serving aboard Navy submarines](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61M6LW20100224) will no doubt pose challenges in logistics and procedures.   These may be minor, however, compared to the problems caused by [banning smoking aboard subs](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/04/09/navy.smoking.subs/index.html), which the Navy will do starting December 31st of this year.   Apparently roughly 35 to 40 percent of submariners are smokers.  Fortunately the Navy will be providing Nicorette gum and nicotine patches to those in need of a nicotine fix.   Sending the “boomers”  out to sea manned by crews “jonesing” for a cigarette seems perilous indeed.
