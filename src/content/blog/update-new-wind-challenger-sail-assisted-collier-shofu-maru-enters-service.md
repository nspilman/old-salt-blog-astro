![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/windchallengercollier.jpg)We have been [following the development](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/05/wind-challenger-project-developing-a-hybrid-sail-assisted-cargo-ship/) of the [Wind Challenger Project](https://www.mol-service.com/service/windchallenger) since it first was unveiled in 2012. Initially developed by the University of Toyko with the support of [Mitsui O.S.K. Lines](https://www.mol.co.jp/en/movie/09.html) and [Oshima-shipbuilding](https://www.osy.co.jp/english/topics/topics_detail.php?topixCode=136), the concept is for a sail-assisted ship with retractable rigid wing sails.

As reported by [Splash247](https://splash247.com/mols-wind-assisted-bulk-carrier-enters-service/), the [*Shofu Maru*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/zh/ais/details/ships/shipid:7193451/mmsi:431794000/imo:9919395/vessel:SHOFU_MARU), the first bulk carrier equipped with a Wind Challenger hard sail propulsion system, has officially started operation following a handover ceremony at Oshima Shipbuilding. The 98,700 DWT bulker will haul coal mainly from Australia, Indonesia, and North America as a dedicated vessel for Tohoku Electric Power Co.

The Wind Challenger design concept envisioned bulk carriers with up to [seven masts](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/05/wind-challenger-project-developing-a-hybrid-sail-assisted-cargo-ship/) set with retractable rigid sails. The *Shofu Maru* has a single bow-mounted mast to test the viability of the design. Nevertheless, the additional propulsion power from the rigid sail is expected to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 5% on a Japan-Australia voyage and about 8% on a Japan-North America West Coast voyage, compared to a conventional vessel of the same type, and contribute to curbing GHG emissions during fuel transportation, MOL said in a statement.

The shipowner has another wind-assisted bulker set to enter service in 2024 to transport wood pellets for Enviva. In addition to its hard sail system, MOL is looking into adopting [Anemoi Marine Technologies](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/12/rotor-sails-fixed-rolling-and-tilting/)’ rotor sails on the vessel, which combined could slash GHG emissions by an average of 20%.
