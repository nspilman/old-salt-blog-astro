Royal Caribbean’s [*Harmony of the Seas*](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships/harmony-of-the-seas) ventured into the Falcon 9 rocket’s flightpath exclusion zone, forcing SpaceX to stand down from the mission. 

[Florida Today](https://news.yahoo.com/cruise-ship-enters-launch-hazard-002820139.html) reports that launch engineers, counting down to a 6:11 p.m. EST liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, waited as long as possible for the Coast Guard to resolve the situation but ultimately ran out of time to meet the instantaneous window’s deadline. It marked the fourth delay for the mission that was previously scrubbed due to inclement weather around Launch Complex 40.

In a statement issued Monday, U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson David Micallef said: “We can confirm the cruise ship was *Harmony of the Seas*. The Coast Guard is actively investigating Sunday’s cruise ship incursion and postponement of the SpaceX launch.”

*Harmony of the Seas* is the world’s third-largest cruise ship at 226,963 gross tons. It has 2,747 staterooms, a passenger capacity of 6,687 and a crew of 2,200.

On the fifth attempt, [the launch was successful on Monday](https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2022/01/31/spacex-launches-into-stunning-skies-fifth-try-lands-florida/9292806002/), lifting a COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation, or CSG-2 satellite into low Earth orbit. The satellite operated by the Italian Space Agency will look back at Earth to gather data on activities for government and commercial purposes.
