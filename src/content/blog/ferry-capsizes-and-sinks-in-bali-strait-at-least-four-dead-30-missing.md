![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tunu1.jpg)The roll-on/roll-off passenger ferry [MV *Tunu Pratama Jaya*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:4655945/mmsi:525022386/imo:8749432/vessel:TUNU_PRATAMA_JAYA) capsized and sank in rough seas late Wednesday on its way to the resort island of Bali, Indonesia. At least four people died, at least 30 are missing, and 31 survivors were rescued, according to local authorities.

“The vessel departed from Ketapang Port in Banyuwangi District, East Java, to Bali’s Gilimanuk Port at 10.56 p.m. and reportedly sank at 11.35 p.m.,” Wahyu Setia Budi, coordinator of the Banyuwangi SAR agency, said.

According to the ship manifest, the MV *Tunu Pratama Jaya* carried 53 passengers, 12 crew members, and 22 cars. Rescuers were still assessing if there were more people on board than the manifest showed. The passengers were all Indonesian, the transport ministry said.

The ferry crossing  – one of the busiest in Indonesia – is around 5km as the crow flies and takes around one hour.

A helicopter and nine boats, including two tug boats and two inflatable boats searched for survivors with assistance from fishermen and people onshore.

Strong waves up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) high and darkness hampered emergency responders overnight, but an official said improved weather and sea conditions Thursday morning were assisting the search effort.

“For today’s search we are focusing on searching on the water, as the initial victims were found in the water between the location of the accident toward Gilimanuk port,” Surabaya Search and Rescue head Nanang Sigit said in a statement.

MV *Tunu Pratama* *Jaya* is a 734 GRT Indonesian-flagged ro-ro/Passenger Ship built in 2010.
