![whaletooth](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whaletooth.jpg)You never know what you will find in a landfill.  [Paleontologist Melissa Macias was looking for fossils](http://abc7.com/science/whale-fossils-up-to-12-million-years-old-found-in-irvine-landfill/1396724/) in the Bowerman Landfill in Irvine, California, when she spotted teeth and bones as a construction crew moved soil to create a new waste disposal area. They turned out to be 18 teeth, a flipper bone and portions of the jaw and skull of a sperm whale, all well preserved. The fossils are believed to be 10-12 million years old.

Macias says that she was lucky to have spotted the fossils. “*Three feet one direction it would have been taken out before I found it. Three feet to the other direction, it would have stayed buried*,” she said.
