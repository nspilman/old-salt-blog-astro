![ussmontgomery2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ussmontgomery2.jpg)The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) USS *Montgomery* suffered another hull crack, this time while transiting the Panama Canal on Sunday. “Under control of the local Panama Canal Pilot, the ship impacted the center lock wall and sustained an 18-inch-long crack between her port quarter and transom plates,” according to [Navy spokesman Cmdr. Ryan Perry](https://news.usni.org/2016/10/31/uss-montgomery-damaged-transiting). “The crack is located 8-10 feet above the waterline and poses no water intrusion or stability risk.”

The newest ship of the [LCS Independence Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence-class_littoral_combat_ship) continues to be having a very hard time on its maiden voyage to its new homeport in San Diego, California. In September, the [ship broke down only three days after being commissioned](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/09/lcs-failures-cno-says-everything-track/), suffering two unrelated engine failures. Then in October, after having her engines repaired, a [hard knock from a tug](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/10/lcs-uss-montgomery-woes-continue-hull-crack-tug-hurricane/) as she was leaving port in Mayport, FL to avoid the approach of Hurricane Matthew. The ship suffered a hull crack and bent five hull stringers.

USS *Montgomery* is now only her way to San Diego. We can only wish her good luck.
