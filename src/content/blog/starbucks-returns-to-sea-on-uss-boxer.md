![boxerstarbucks](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/02/boxerstarbucks.jpg)There is virtually no place on earth beyond its reach. No, not the US Navy. Starbucks. The coffee seller is now even opening a store on a navy warship, the amphibious assault ship, [USS Boxer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Boxer_\(LHD-4\)). The “Starboxer” is the first “fully functioning coffee shop” serving Starbucks coffee on a US Navy ship.  It is only fitting that Starbucks has gone to sea.  The company was named after the chief mate of the *Pequod* in Herman Melville’s novel “Moby Dick.”  Melville in turn used the name of a prominent whaling family in Nantucket for Ahab’s second in command.  In a very real sense, Starbucks has been at sea for quite some time. Thanks to [Linda Collison](http://www.lindacollison.com/) for point out the new source of floating caffeine.
