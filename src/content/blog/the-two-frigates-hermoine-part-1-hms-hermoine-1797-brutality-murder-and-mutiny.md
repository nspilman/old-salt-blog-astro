There were two frigates, both named *Hermione*, both launched within a few years of each other.  The British HMS *Hermione* would become a symbol of cruelty and bloody mutiny, whereas the French *Hermione* would carry the young Gilbert Motier, better known as the Marquis de Lafayette on a crucial voyage to assist a rebellion against the English Crown in its North American colonies. Neither ship has been forgotten.  The mutiny on the HMS *Hermoine* has become a fixture in nautical fiction, whereas the French *Hermione* is being reborn in a shipyard in Rochefort sur mer.

The British frigate, HMS *Hermione* was commissioned in 1783 as 32-gun fifth-rate frigate.  Five captains served competently on her quarterdeck until in in February 1797 — the year of the Spithead and Nore mutinies — Captain Hugh Pigot was given command.  Within a year, HMS *Hermoine* was the scene of the bloodiest mutiny in British history. The excellent video by [Maritime Great Britain](http://www.maritimegreatbritain.com/) tells the tale:
