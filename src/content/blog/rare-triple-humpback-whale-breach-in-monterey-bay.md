![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/10/humpbreach.jpg)Whale-watchers aboard the *Atlantic Monterey* witnessed an amazing show on Sunday when three humpback whales performed an extremely rare triple breach in Monterey Bay, CA.  And it was caught on video (see after the page break.)

[SFGate](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/Stunning-video-captures-extremely-rare-triple-15641164.php) reports that the captain of the whale-watching boat had never seen a triple breach in his 45 years out on the water.

“Lucky guests were treated to the trip of a lifetime Saturday afternoon on the Atlantis Monterey,” [Princess Monterey Whale Watching](https://montereywhalewatching.com/) commented on the video. “A very active Humpback calf and two adults put on quite a show, displaying an array of surface activity. Chin slapping, pectoral fin slapping, and a very rare triple breach!”

Experts noted earlier this year that humpback whale traffic off the California coast is particularly crowded amid this season’s southward migration due to an abundance of anchovies and sardines reported in the northern Pacific.
