Missing Journalist Kim Wall and Submarine UC3 Nautilus

On Saturday, we [posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/08/strange-saga-uc3-nautilus-sub-sinks-inventor-held-murder/) that the Danish inventor [Peter Madsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Madsen_\(inventor\)) has been held on suspicion of murder following the disappearance of Kim Wall, a Swedish journalist, and the sinking of the privately owned submarine [*UC3 Nautilus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC3_Nautilus) on Friday off Denmark. Madsen claimed that he dropped Wall off on an island before the submarine sank. Wall, however, remains missing. She was last seen with Madsen on the privately-owned submarine. 

The Danish police suspect that Madsen sank the submarine intentionally. The Guardia reports: *Police spokesman Jens Møller Jensen said on Sunday that the submarine had been raised from the sea bed and searched but no body had been discovered. The search for Wall in the water, from the air and on land, continues. Møller Jensen added that there were indications that Madsen deliberately sank his submarine.*

Madsen faces a preliminary manslaughter charge “for having killed in an unknown way and in an unknown place Kim Isabell Frerika Wall of Sweden sometime after Thursday 5pm”. A judge ordered that he be held in pre-trial detention for 24 days while the investigation into Wall’s disappearance continues.
