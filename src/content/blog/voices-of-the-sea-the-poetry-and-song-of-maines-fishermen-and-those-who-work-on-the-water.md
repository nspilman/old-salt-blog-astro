![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/03/fisherm_poets.jpg)Not long ago, we posted about the [Fisher Poets Gathering](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/02/25/fisher-poets-gathering-of-astoria-underway-this-weekend/) in Astoria, Oregon.  There are indeed fisherman poets on all coasts and this Thursday, March 15th, the [Maine Maritime Museum](http://www.mainemaritimemuseum.org/) in Bath, Maine is hosting “[Voices of the Sea: The Poetry and Song of Maine’s Fishermen and Those Who Work on the Water](http://www.mainemaritimemuseum.org/events/voices-sea/),” from 5:30 p.m. – 7:30 p.m.

The event will feature “*working fishermen and those who work on the sea reading their own original work, poems and songs that examine their water-borne careers through verse.*  
  
*Joining the fishermen on stage will be folksinger and sailor Gordon Bok. Among the singers and poets presenting their work are Frank Gotwals, a lobsterman from Stonington, Maine, Stefanie Alley who lobsters out of Islesford, Jack Merrill, who lobsters and serves on the board of the Maine Lobstermen’s Association, and Kendall Morse, a former Coast Guardsman turned folk musician and humorist*.”
