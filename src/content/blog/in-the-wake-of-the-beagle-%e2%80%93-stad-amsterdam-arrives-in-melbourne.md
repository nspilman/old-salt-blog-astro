Back in September we posted about a group of historians and naturalists, as well as a film crew for Dutch VPRO Television sailing on the *[Stad Amsterdam](http://www.stadamsterdam.com/content/home/index.xml)*. The ship is retracing the voyage of *[HMS Beagle](http://beagle.vpro.nl/)* on the 150th anniversary of the publication of Darwin’s [On the Origin of the Species](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486450066?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0486450066).  See [Retracing Darwin’s Journey – 150 Years Later](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/09/10/retracing-darwins-journey-150-years-later/).    The ship arrived in Sydney, Australia earlier this month and last week called at Melbourne.   Visit the [project website here](http://beagle.vpro.nl/) (in Dutch and English.)
