![sorenrefit](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2009/10/sorenrefit.jpg)Last May, we posted about the Tall Ship *Soren Larsen*’s new season of voyages –  [Tall ship *Soren Larsen* – Pearls of the Pacific, Voyages across the South Seas 2009](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/05/14/tallship-soren-larsen-pearls-of-the-pacific-voyages-across-the-south-seas-2009/).  Unfortunately, the ship was hit by a [rogue wave](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/08/11/rogue-wave-hot-spots-identified/) on the 1st of June and suffered serious damage.

Fortunately, no one was seriously injured, beyond a few bruises, cuts and a few strained knees. The deck house and bulwarks suffered major damage, but the ship made it safely back to port.   The last few months have been spent making repairs.  From the [*Soren Larsen* site](http://www.sorenlarsen.co.nz/index.html):  
  
***So what happened?***

*About 0715 on Monday 1st June as the ship was under reefed mains’l, main and lower staysail and lower tops’l a wave came aboard on the starboard side and washed into the side of the deckhouse and veggie locker.*

***Damage?***

*Well the deckhouse looks like a tv image of house struck by an earthquake… Significant. There’s other damage around the starboard bulwarks which we’re now assessing. The rig, the hull and below – all fine.*

***Any injuries?***

*A few bruises and a couple of strained knees but everyone is fine. Jarren has a black eye and cut nose but it seems to suit him.*

***How bad was the weather?***

*A cold southerly had come up the coast overnight and the ship was battened down and sailing in 5-6 m seas. Nic says ‘it was definately unpleasant, but not horrendous’. Soren had coped well with far worse and this one wave arrived unannounced.*

***A freak wave?***

*No – a rogue wave is the right term. One whose dynamic forces, timing and position combine to pack a real punch.*

***How did the crew deal with it all?***

*Magnificently. All permanent crew and voyage crew were quite, quite magnificent in managing with the situation. Calm and uncomplaining in getting on with securing the ship, effecting temporary repairs and keeping themselves safe. Things were flat out all day before watches were resumed and the ship was headed for home.*

**The repairs are going well**

*With the bulwarks finished and the topside complete we were painting till midnight (its always midnight) to make the deadline the next morning for taking down the awning and scaffolding. Sparkling white enamel paint now covers the new planking and freshly galvanized steelwork. Dismantling the white plastic shrink wrap cover and pipe work this morning reveals a graceful tall ship we haven’t seen in a long time..*

*Without the deck house the hull lines and deck configuration are seen as they were when Soren Larsen was first launched. The starboard shrouds and rigging are being reassembled and the rest of the hull repainted as we wait to see what will be decided about the deck house construction.*

*Its nice to have our ship back again*.

The *Soren Larsen* is a beautiful ship, sailed by a great group of sailors. We look forward to hearing of the *Soren Larsen* sailing again.  [You can follow their progress here.](http://news.sorenlarsen.co.nz/pebble/)
