![shipmainstar2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shipmainstar2.jpg)On a winter’s day, when the temperature here on the banks of the Hudson River is in the low 30s F, but with the wind off the water feels more like the low 20s, there are many reasons to want to pick up and move to sunny and warm, Southern California.  And now I’ve found one more — a press release, issued today, from the [Maritime Museum of San Diego](http://www.sdmaritime.org/).

*Have you ever wanted to learn to sail and maintain a tallship?*

*The Maritime Museum will soon be starting a class on how to sail and maintain tall ships. The class will train you how to sail ships from four different centuries which include the 19th century Californian, a tops’l schooner; the 18th century HMS Surprise a full rigged British Frigate, the 19th century three masted Bark the Star of India, 16th century Spanish Galleon San Salvador and the 20th century steam yacht Medea. Sail and maintenance crew members can expect to learn skills such as rope making, knot tying, climbing the rigging, maintenance of the ships, and much more.*

*Orientation will be held on January 15 at 6pm and the first class will be held on January 26 at 8am. There is no cost for the classes, however, crew members must be Maritime Museum members and have their own health insurance.*

*For sail crew information call 619-234-9153 ext.127 or visit the museum’s website at ww.sdmaritime.org/volunteer/ .*
