Many years ago, I was in Kaohsiung, Taiwan on a container ship having major steel work done in the  [CSBS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSBC_Corporation,_Taiwan) drydock.  In those days, there was a scrap yard within sight of the drydock and for  the week or so that we were there, I was fascinated watching the LNG ship *Benjamin Franklin* growing smaller and smaller, as it was cut apart by workers, who at that distance resembled insects.  It was like watching the carcass of a great beast being devoured, as everyday, there was less of the ship, pulled higher up on the ways. I was reminded of this by Dave Shirlaw, on the MarHist list, when he pointed out a video of the scrapping of Navy Oiler *[USS Savannah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Savannah_\(AOR-4\))* by [Esco Marine](http://www.escomarine.us/), in an article in *Gizmodo* – [The Destruction of a US Navy Ship As Big As a City Block](do.com/5882161/how-do-they-take-apart-a-us-navy-ship-as-big-as-a-city-).  See also *[Mining a Mega Ship](http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/national-geographic-channel/specials-1/science-technology/ngc-mining-a-mega-ship/).*  Just as ships need shipyards to be born, they also need scrapyards when they can go to die.
