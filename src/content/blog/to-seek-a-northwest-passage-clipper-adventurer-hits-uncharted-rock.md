Clipper Adventurer

[Stan Roger](http://www.fogartyscovemusic.skyrocketlabs.com/)‘s classic song begins, “A*h, for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage; to find the hand of Franklin reaching for the Beaufort Sea*.”   Stan died in 1983, but his son, Nathan Rogers, also a singer, recently set out on the Canadian cruise ship *[Clipper Adventurer](http://www.adventure-life.com/cruises/ships/clipper-adventurer-qu-14/)* [](http://www.adventure-life.com/cruises/ships/clipper-adventurer-qu-14/)bound for the Arctic via the Northwest Passage only to discover the challenges that remain in these icy waters.   On Friday, the *Clipper Adventurer* struck an uncharted rock  in about three metres of water, about 55 nautical miles east of Kugluktuk, Nunavut, which is also known as Coppermine, near the border with the Northwest Territories.  After attempts to free the ship failed over the weekend the [Canadian icebreaker,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCGS_Amundsen) *[Amundsen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCGS_Amundsen)*, evacuated the passengers and crew.  They were ferried to Kugluktuk and are expected to fly to Edmonton some time today.
