*A foreign cargo ship is stranded on a protected coral reef in the southern Philippines and may be stuck for three weeks, raising fears of environmental damage, authorities said on Thursday.*

*The Panamanian-registered MV Double Prosperity was carrying about 65,000 tonnes of coal from Australia to India when it hit Bakud Reef on Sunday, regional coast guard commander Roy Echeverria told AFP.*

*About three-quarters of the 225-metre-long (743-foot-long) ship is stuck on the reef and it is lying in barely two metres of water, making the task of refloating it very difficult, he said.*

*“Weather permitting… the ship may be extricated within more or less three weeks,” he said, adding it would also take time to bring in specialist equipment.*

*Echeverria said there were concerns the ship’s fuel may start leaking, and inflatable oil spill booms had been brought into the area as a precaution, although there were no signs this had yet occurred.*
