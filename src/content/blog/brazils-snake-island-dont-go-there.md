[Queimada Grande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilha_da_Queimada_Grande) is a Brazilian island in the Atlantic Ocean roughly 90 miles from São Paulo. It is off limits to most visitors, not because it harbors secrets or treasure, but rather because it has more snakes, between one and five per square meter than perhaps any other spot on the face of the earth. And these are not just any snakes, but a unique and deadly species of pit viper, the [golden lancehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothrops_insularis).  Not surprisingly, Queimada Grande is nicknamed Snake Island.
