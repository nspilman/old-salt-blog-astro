![ohp](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ohp.jpg)There are great things going on in Rhode Island. When [completed this year](http://www.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/content/20131229-r.i.-tall-ship-oliver-hazard-perry-on-course-to-make-maiden-voyage-in-2014.ece), the [SSV *Oliver Hazard Perry*](http://www.ohpri.org/) will be the first ocean-going full-rigged ship to be built in the U.S. in 100 years and the largest civilian sail training vessel in America.  With a sparred length of almost 200 feet, she will carry 14,000 square feet of sail on three masts. Based in Newport, SSV *Oliver Hazard Perry* will be Rhode Island’s official sailing education vessel and flagship non-profit maritime campus, offering experience-based, core learning opportunities to a diverse student population, including those with disabilities.

Seven weeks of [Youth Adventure Summer Camp](http://www.ohpri.org/youth-summer-camp) are already scheduled for July and August. The six day camps will accommodate 30-34 students between the ages of 13 -18. The ship’s itinerary for these sessions will include the historically rich ports of Newport, Nantucket, Boston, Portsmouth, NH and Greenport, NY. The ship will sail with a professional crew of 15.  

Berths for the Adventure Summer camp are available on a first come first serve basis.  Camp price for six days/nights is $1,600 (10% discount for enrolling before Feb. 1, 2014), which includes all meals and seamanship/sailing instruction with a ratio of staff to students of 1:4. For more information on SSV *Oliver Hazard Perry’*s Education-at-Sea programs call Jess Wurzbacher at 401.841.0080 or r[egister on-line here](https://ohpri.worldsecuresystems.com/youth-registration).
