![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/teamhpp.jpg)Today, April 11th, is [World Parkinson’s Day](https://worldparkinsonsday.com/). Parkinson’s disease is a progressive and debilitating neurological disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. It is the fastest growing and the second most prevalent neurological condition, affecting an estimated 11.8 million people worldwide. From 1990 to 2015, the number of people with Parkinson disease doubled to over 6 million. Experts now expect 25 million Parkinson’s diagnosis by the year 2050.

Despite significant advancements in treatment, there is still no known cure for  Parkinson’s. While drugs can help control the symptoms, so far the best method for slowing the disease progression is exercise, which brings us to the story of [Patrick Morrissey](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/entertainment/michael-j-fox-foundation-patrick-morrissey-parkinsons/index.html) and the [Team Human Powered Potential (HPP)](https://humanpoweredpotential.org/).

Team HPP is a four man rowing team, consisting of longtime friends Brendan Cusick, Peter Durso, Scott Forman and Patrick Morrissey.  They competed in the [2024 Pacific World’s Toughest Row,](https://www.worldstoughestrow.com/the-pacific/) rowing 2,800 miles across the Pacific Ocean from Monterey, California to Hanalei Bay, Kauai, Hawaii. They finished the race in 41 days.

Team HPP was one of nine teams from around the globe participating in the race. The team broke several records. They raised a record [$41 million dollars for Parkinson’s research](https://www.michaeljfox.org/Summer2024), becoming the top fundraising team since the race’s inception. 

One of the team, Patrick Morrissey, 53, has been living with Parkinson’s and found his own way to manage his symptoms, to become the first person with Parkinson’s disease to row across the Pacific. 

Morrissey had never rowed a day in his life when he decided to join the Team HPP in their voyage across the Pacific. He originally agreed too serve as a spokesperson for the effort. When his three friends started looking for a fourth teammate, Morrissey, who had been a former Division I college wrestler and as an adult, enjoyed everything from mountain biking to skiing, before being diagnosed with Parkinson’s, volunteered to join his friends.

“Being out on the ocean, rowing for a cure and feeling the unconditional support from my teammates and the larger community will be something I always cherish,” says Morrissey. “Together, we endured every moment on the water to get here. It shows that if you put the right people around you — in a boat or not — you can achieve anything.”

The $41 million raised by Team HPP went to [The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s research](https://www.michaeljfox.org/).  The team is determined to continue their mission to help find a cure for Parkinson’s disease by performing or supporting adventure philanthropy.

Patrick lives with his wife of 30 years, Dena, in Durango, CO and they have two wonderful adult daughters, Lauran and Mara.
