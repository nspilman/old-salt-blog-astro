![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/innovation-challenge.jpg)Each year more than 9 million tons of plastic makes its way into the oceans of the world. Plastic debris in ocean garbage patches is growing exponentially. By one estimate, there will be [more plastic than fish](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/01/20/by-2050-there-will-be-more-plastic-than-fish-in-the-worlds-oceans-study-says/?utm_term=.a86d9735e1f1) in the ocean by 2050. 

What can be done? The [Ocean Plastic Innovation Challenge](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/innovation-challenges/plastic/) is looking for answers. It is a year-long competition to seek innovative ideas from the public to address the problems of ocean plastics. They are offering $500,000 in prize money and at least $1 million in investment dollars to the winners.

The challenge is a partnership between [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.org) and [Sky Ocean Ventures](https://www.skygroup.sky/corporate/media-centre/articles/en-gb/sky-launches-sky-ocean-ventures-to-invest-in-ideas-and-businesses-who-can-help-solve-the-oceans-plastic-crisis), an investment vehicle funded by the European entertainment company. Last year, the partnership launched [Planet or Plastic?](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/planetorplastic/) — an initiative aimed at provoking change around single-use plastics.

The [contest focuses on three paths](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/do-you-have-a-solution-to-the-rising-tide-of-plastic-pollution-in-our-seas-enter-this-contest/2019/02/22/21e1db04-3480-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html?utm_term=.f3155dc4a074) to ocean plastic reduction: designing alternatives to today’s single-use plastics, figuring out how to tweak supply chains to reduce plastic waste, and using data visualization to spur awareness and action. Contestants can register in any of those three categories.

[Registration is open](https://media.nationalgeographic.org/assets/file/Rules_-_Prize_Agreement_-_National_Geographic_Ocean_Plastic_Innovation_Challenge.pdf). The submission deadline is June 11. Winners will be announced in December. And with $1.5 million in awards and investment — and the future of the planet at stake — there’s no time to lose.
