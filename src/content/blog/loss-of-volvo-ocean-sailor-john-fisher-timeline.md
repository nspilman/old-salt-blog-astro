[![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/03/johnfisher2.jpg)Team Sun Hung Kai/Scallywag](https://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/teams/Team-Sun-Hung-Kai-Scallywag.html) has put out a [timeline of events](https://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/news/11370_Update-from-Team-Sun-Hung-Kai-Scallywag.html) in the recent loss of John Fisher overboard while sailing in high winds and seas in the Southern Ocean in the [Volvo Ocean Race](https://www.volvooceanrace.com).

*   They were sailing in Leg 7 of the Volvo Ocean Race from Auckland, New Zealand to Itajai, Brazil, approximately 1,400 nautical miles west of Cape Horn. The wind was blowing 35-45 knots with 4 to 5 meter seas. Intermittent showers reduced visibility.
*   At 15 minutes before sunrise, Fisher unclipped his tether to go forward to “tidy up” a jib sheet. The Team statement says that untethering was “standard procedure when moving between positions.”
*   As Fisher moved forward SHK/Scallywag surfed down a large wave and accidentally crash gybed. Fisher was hit by the mainsheet tackle and was knocked overboard. The crew on board believe Fisher was unconscious from the blow before he hit the water. He was wearing a survival suit with a wetsuit hood and gloves and a lifejacket.
*   The [JON buoy](http://www.oscarsierra.com/mob_recovery.html) and the horseshoe buoy were thrown off the back of the boat to mark the position
*   It took approximately 40 minutes to get the boat under control and to motor sail back to the position where Fisher went overboard. They searched for several hours but found no sign of Fisher or either buoy. In deteriorating weather, they reluctantly abandoned the search. 

There seem to several takeaways from the tragedy. The first and the most obvious is that a gybe in high winds and seas can be deadly. In 2016, [Andrew Ashman, sailing in the Clipper Round the World Race,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/04/report-clipper-round-world-race-deaths-released/) died after being struck by a mainsheet when the *IchorCoal* gybed unexpectedly. Ashman was tethered in the cockpit but died of injuries to his neck and head. 

The second takeaway, also obvious, is that moving forward without being clipped-in is very dangerous. There does not appear to have been a jackstay or other means for Fisher to move from the cockpit and stay tethered. As was the case with Andrew Ashman, John Fisher might still have been seriously injured or killed by being hit by the mainsheet tackle, but if tethered he might have stayed aboard, where he possibly could have received first aid. 

In the timeline account, there is no mention of any sort of Personal Locator Beacon (PLB). Given the circumstances and the geography, a GPS PLB may not have been of any practical use. An AIS PLB, however, might have allowed the boat to home-in on the missing sailor using their AIS receiver.
