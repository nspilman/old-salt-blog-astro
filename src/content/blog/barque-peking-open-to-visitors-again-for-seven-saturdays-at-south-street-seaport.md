![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/02/southstreet2.jpg)The [barque *Peking*](http://www.southstreetseaportmuseum.org/category-s/1875.htm), one of the last Laeisz “[Flying P Liners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner),” at New York’s [South Street Seaport](http://www.southstreetseaportmuseum.org/default.asp) will be open to visitors again for seven Saturdays, from 12:00 to 4:00 pm, starting today and running through October 19th. The four-masted steel hulled barque, built in 1911, has been closed since the [museum shut down in February 2011](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/new-yorks-seaport-museum-struggles-to-stay-afloat/).  Other parts of the museum have reopened since but the *Peking* has remained shuttered.  The [future of the ship is uncertain](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/10/windjammer-peking-needs-a-new-home-south-street-deal-with-hamburg-falls-through/), so this may be a good time to visit.[

There are also lots of other activities going on at the Seaport, including a block printing workshop at Bowne printers, wood carving demonstrations by Sal Polisi, as well as sails on the schooner [*Pioneer*](http://www.southstreetseaportmuseum.org/category-s/1830.htm).   [Click here to learn more](http://www.southstreetseaportmuseum.org/SearchResults.asp?Cat=1513).
