![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/irishfishermeneussia.jpg)Russia planned on holding naval exercises off the coast of Ireland. Fishermen from County Cork on Ireland’s southern coast saw the exercises as a threat to their livelihood and threatened to continue fishing as usual, despite the threatened use of naval artillery and rockets in the area. They stated, “[Our presence is our protest](https://www.yahoo.com/now/irish-fishermen-plan-disrupt-russian-073140988.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALxGSoIQLrNgpVlC_kyFc7DtNOmzC0MYmmbND6V40W387mbH4s02XJ6UKjxu--1kOkjaMvaEvx0fW-sJjiOKHia_qiW3oO9ZHkba7o55DaFlQ7z9DulEV0Sh2FrtqF1vrRWPXdq6eVxAqYhPdGWP6Sp2NDDBcool4dx64z4h_0tL).”

Remarkably, the Russia military backed down, announcing the exercises would be moved as “a gesture of goodwill” after appeals from the Irish government and the fishermen, “with the aim not to hinder fishing activities.”  

Russia had announced its intention to hold naval exercises in early February, approximately 240 kilometers (149 miles) off Ireland’s southwest coast. The area is in Ireland’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), but not its territorial waters. Under international law, states are entitled to carry out naval exercises in another state’s EEZ.

Ireland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the exercises were “not welcome” or “wanted right now.” The Irish South and West Fish Producer’s Organisation, representing the fishing community of southwestern Ireland, joined in the protest.

Patrick Murphy, head of the fishermen’s organization, met the Russian Ambassador to Ireland Yury Filatov last week to press the fishermen’s case. They initially told the Russians they planned on fishing to peacefully disrupt the naval activities.

Murphy told [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/europe/ireland-fishermen-russia-navy-intl/index.html) that he believed it was the work of him and other fishermen who raised international awareness of the issue who helped Moscow change its mind.

“You wouldn’t expect the Russian nation to listen to a couple of fishermen,” he said.

“Doesn’t it show that a simple little conversation can change things? It’s huge. The power of words is a lot better than the power of the gun. I’m chuffed.”

> What a story. Russia has cancelled naval exercises off the coast of Ireland after Irish fishermen threatened to continue fishing and peacefully disrupt the war games.
