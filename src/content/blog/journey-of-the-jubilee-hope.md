![LAKE-HOSPITAL1-586x319](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/10/LAKE-HOSPITAL1-586x319.jpg)The hospital ship *Jubilee Hope* was recently [christened by the Princess Royal](http://nairobidigest.co.ke/princess-royal-launches-lake-victoria-hospital-ship/), in Tanzania on Lake Victoria. The 160 ton ship will provide health services to 150 remote island communities with 400,000 people on the large inland lake. She will be operated by [Vine Trust](http://www.vinetrust.org/about/article/jubilee-hope-glasgow-to-mombasa), an international charity.

The 8,585 mile voyage of the *Jubilee Hope* is as remarkable as her new service. She began her life as [RMAS *Dunster*](http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=1301618), a Royal Navy tender. Converted to a hospital ship on the Clyde by BAE Systems, [the ship has a full dental surgery, operating room](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/navy-ship-jubilee-hope-tanzania-healthcare), two consulting areas, an eye surgery and a laboratory. It will host life-changing cataract operations, offer a dentistry service and provide help for difficult labors and a range of other healthcare needs.

The ship sailed from Glasgow last January 22.  After a 246 day voyage, the ship arrived at Mwanza, Kenya and was made ready for the last and possibly most difficult leg of its voyage, a 500 mile trek overland.   To fit under low power lines, the funnel and part of the deck house was cut off before the rest of the ship was loaded onto a flatbed to be hauled by truck to the shores of Lake Victoria.
