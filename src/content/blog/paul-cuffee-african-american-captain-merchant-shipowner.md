![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/paulcuffee.jpg)As Black History Month comes to a close, it is worthwhile to remember early African-American shipmasters. Who was the first? That is hard to say. [Paul Cuffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cuffee) is a good candidate. 

Paul Cuffe was born on Cuttyhunk Island, MA on January 17, 1759, the seventh of ten children of Kofi or Cuffee Slocum and Ruth Moses. His father, a freed black man, was a member of the [Ashanti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Region) people of Ghana. His mother was a Native American of the [Wampanoag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wampanoag_people "Wampanoag people") Nation of [Martha’s Vineyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha%27s_Vineyard "Martha's Vineyard"). Cuffee Slocum was a skilled carpenter, farmer, and fisherman, who taught himself to read and write. In 1766, Cuffee Slocum was able to purchase a 116-acre farm in Westport, Massachusetts.

Paul Cuffe went to sea at 16 on whalers and merchant ships, where he learned navigation. During the American Revolution, his ship was captured by the British and Cuffee was imprisoned for three months in 1776 in New York. He returned home to Massachusetts and in 1779 built an open boat which he used to run the British blockade, bringing trade goods to Nantucket and ports on the Massachusetts coast.

He built up a small fleet of open boats and then moved on to schooners. His first seagoing vessel was the 15-ton *Box Iron*, followed by a 25-ton schooner, *Sun Fish*, and the 40-ton schooner *Mary*. By 1796, Cuffee built *Ranger,* a 69-ton schooner in his shipyard in Westport. By 1800, Cuffee purchased a half-interest in the 162-ton bark *Hero*.  In 1806, he had the 109-ton brig *Traveller* and 268-ton ship *Alpha* built. By the early 1800s, Paul Cuffe was one of the most wealthy men of color in the United States.

In addition to his maritime activities, he was also politically and socially active. His petition to protest taxation of people of color while withholding the right to vote was an important step in granting full citizenship rights in Massachusetts. He established the first racially integrated school in Westport, Massachusetts and was a vocal abolitionist. Cuffee was also an early proponent of the “Back to Africa” movement, a topic he discussed with President James Madison, becoming the first black men to have a formal meeting with a sitting U.S. president.

Today, the [Paul Cuffe Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cuffe_Farm) in Westport is a National Historic Landmark and the [Paul Cuffee School](http://www.paulcuffee.org), a maritime charter school in Providence, Rhode Island, is named in his honor. 

[Captain Paul Cuffe Park](https://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/paul-cuffe/captain-paul-cuffe-park-2-0/) at the corner of Johnny Cake Hill and Union Street in New Bedford, MA was expanded and re-dedicated on September 21, 2018.  The [New Bedford Whaling Museum](https://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/exhibitions/captain-paul-cuffe-his-work-vision-and-living-legacy/) currently features an exhibition, [Captain Paul Cuffe: His Work, Vision, and Living Legacy](http://Captain Paul Cuffe: His Work, Vision, and Living Legacy).
