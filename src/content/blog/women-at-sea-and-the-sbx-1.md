![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/250px-Sbx_underway.jpg)We recently [posted about “Women At Sea: Screening, Conversation, Reception](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/24/shipping-out-the-story-of-americas-seafaring-women/),” which was held last Wednesday in Manhattan.  The program included a fascinating documentary [Shipping Out, the Story of America’s Seafaring Women](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002D5RAL2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002D5RAL2) and a [panel discussion with a number of women seafarers](http://workingharbor.com/index.html), including the Coast Guard Captain of the Port of New York, Capt. Linda L. Fagan; Coast Guard Head of Prevention, Commander Linda A. Sturgis;  tugboat Captain Ann Loeding; Sandy Hook Pilot, Capt. Coleen Quinn; former tanker, bulker and car carrier Second Mate Debra Tischler; Chief Engineer Jessica DuLong, and Marissa Strawbridge, Second Mate of the SBX-1.  The program and the presentations were extremely interesting and well done.

At the end of the evening I did ask myself one question, what is an [SBX-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea-based_X-band_Radar)?  I had even asked Ms. Strawbridge and I still wasn’t sure.  
  
This morning [Bonnie K. Frogma](http://frogma.blogspot.com/), a fellow New York waterblogger, who was also at the presentation, discovered that when visiting Hawaii that she had a photograph taken of her in which there was an odd looking vessel in the background. It was the [SBX-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea-based_X-band_Radar).

But what is an SBX-1?  It is a Sea-based X-band Radar, a floating, self-propelled, mobile radar station mounted on a fifth generation Norwegian-designed, Russian-built CS-50 semi-submersible twin-hulled oil-drilling platform.  It is a dynamically positioned platform designed to operate in high winds and heavy seas and is a part of the U.S. Defense Department [Ballistic Missile Defense System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_Missile_Defense_System).

So it is either a critical part of our national defense or an April Fool’s Day joke.  OK, its is not a joke, just one of the odder looking and most unusual vessels on the ocean.
