Things are getting tense again in the East China Sea, specifically between the Chinese and Japanese.  The dispute is over a small group of uninhabited islands that lie between Okinawa and Taiwan and are known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese.   Both natiosn claim the islands as soverign territory. Recently a Japanese nationalist group known as Ganbare Nippon sent 10 fishing boats carrying dozens of its members to the area around the islands. A representative for the group, Yasushi Watanabe, said the voyage — the third by Ganbare Nippon this year — was aimed at publicizing Japan’s territorial claim to the area, not at landing on the islands.  In response, the Chinese sent eight marine surveillance ships to the area.
