*The German defense minister has dismissed the commander of the naval training ship Gorch Fock after cadets complained of harsh treatment from superiors following a fatal accident. The ship will now return to Germany.*  
  
*German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg has dismissed the commander of the naval training ship Gorch Fock after rumors of mutiny following a fatal accident on board.*

*Guttenberg ordered the ship to “return directly to Germany” and asked for Commander Norbert Schatz to be relieved of his duty, according to German media reports.*

*The Gorch Fock “will be removed from the list of ships at the ready, until a commission is formed including members of the German Bundestag that can determine whether the Gorch Fock has a future on the open sea as a training ship and emissary of Germany,” the minister said. It will be docked in Kiel until further notice.*

*The vessel was ordered on Thursday to return to its last port of call in southern Argentina amid fears of a mutiny. Investigators have boarded the ship and are trying to establish whether the allegations are founded.*
