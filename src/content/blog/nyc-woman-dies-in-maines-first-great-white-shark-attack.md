![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/greatwhite1.jpg)Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, from New York City died Monday after being bitten by a great white shark while she was swimming approximately 20 yards off the western shore of Bailey Island, near the city of Portland, according to Maine Department of Marine Resources Patrick Keliher in a [statement Tuesday.](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/news-details.html?id=2987715&fbclid=IwAR3xUv5icm1JQTXj0IIvA6n3d0lG5ZDri2N2BxeLKKV9K5tZolOtYJD1EuY)

Ms. Holowach, who was wearing a black wetsuit, was swimming with her daughter when she was attacked. Her daughter swam for the island and screamed for help. Two nearby kayakers brought the badly injured Holowach to shore, where she died before paramedics could arrive. 

After the attack, officials recovered a fragment of a tooth, which was positively identified as from a great white shark.

Shark attacks are very rare in Maine. The attack on Holowach is the first fatal shark attack on record in the state.

“I think it’s generally accepted that the increase in the number of seals is leading to more white sharks coming closer to shore during some months,” Nick Whitney, a senior scientist at the New England Aquarium, told [Maine Public Radio](https://www.mainepublic.org/post/scientist-increase-seal-population-likely-attracting-more-sharks-maine-waters).

Julie Holowach was a New York fashion executive who [retired early to spend time with her family.](https://nypost.com/2020/07/28/nyc-woman-killed-in-maine-shark-attack-retired-early-pal-says/)
