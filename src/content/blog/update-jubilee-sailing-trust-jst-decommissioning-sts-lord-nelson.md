STS Lord Nelson

In early July, the [Jubilee Sailing Trus](https://jst.org.uk/)t (JST) faced a financial crisis where it needed to [raise £1m in five days](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/07/crisis-at-the-jubilee-sailing-trust-emergency-appeal-hopes-to-prevent-shutdown/) in order to stay in operation. Fortunately, the charity succeeded in raising the funds in time. Their financial challenges have not ended, however.

The [charity has announced that it will be decommissioning one of its two ships](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-49083646), the [STS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS_Lord_Nelson) *Lord Nelson,* and will continue its operations on the [STS*Tenacious*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV_Tenacious). Both ships were specially designed and fitted to allow people with physical impairments, including wheelchair users, to sail side-by-side with people who do not have disabilities. It appears that *Lord Nelson* will be dockside while *Tenacious* will continue sailing.

In a statement, the charity said its review would put “stronger financial footing”, with STS *Lord Nelson* potentially being used as a visitor attraction to promote the trust.

“A single vessel will also help the JST deliver a much stronger voyage experience by concentrating investment into crew training, professional development, along with ship maintenance, and other elements that improve life on-board,” it said.
