![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/maximnamecontest.jpg)Next year, the UK port of [Sunderland will be hosting 80 tall ships](https://www.tallshipssunderland.com/) at the start of the Tall Ships Races 2018. To support the festivities, [Maxim Brewery](http://www.maximbrewery.co.uk/) will be brewing a special nautical themed porter. But what to call it? That is the question at hand. In partnership with [The Sunderland Echo and SunFM, the brewery is holding a competition](http://www.sunderlandecho.com/our-region/sunderland/how-you-could-be-part-of-a-nautical-themed-beer-to-toast-the-tall-ships-race-in-sunderland-1-8780099) to name the rum-porter. The winner will receive a tour of Maxim Brewery and may even get to help out in the brewing of the Tall Ships beer.  Here is how it will work:

*   October 2 to October 13 – Both the Sunderland Echo and Sun FM will hold a joint competition for a Tall Ships cask beer name.
*   October 16 – The best entries will be chosen and the top ten will go forward to a public vote.
*   October 18 to October 25 – Watch out for details on how you can pick your favorites, through a vote on the Sunderland Echo website.
*   November 6 – The name of the winning beer will be announced.

To enter send your suggested beer name by by midday on Friday, October 13 to chris.cordner@jpress.co.uk

[Sunderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunderland) on River Wear has a long and rich history of shipping and shipbuilding.  The region was once called “[the largest shipbuilding town in the world](http://www.bbc.co.uk/wear/content/articles/2008/01/16/shipbuilding_has_been_20_years_feature.shtml).”  Shipbuilding began on the River Wear in 1346. Throughout its history, Sunderland has had over 400 registered shipyards. The last remaining shipyard closed in 1988.
