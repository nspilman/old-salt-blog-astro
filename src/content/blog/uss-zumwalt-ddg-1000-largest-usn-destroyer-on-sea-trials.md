![zumwalt2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/zumwalt2.jpg)The [USS *Zumwalt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Zumwalt), DDG 1000, the largest and most expensive destroyer ever built for the US Navy, headed down the Kennebeck River from Bath Iron Works, in Bath, Maine yesterday, on its way to sea trials in the open Atlantic. Depending on who you listen to, the ship is the design of the future, far more capable than other warships of its type in both firepower and stealth. On the other hand, many argue that [the radical hull form is inherently unstable](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/12/new-high-tech-zumawalt-class-destroyer-is-it-seaworthy/) particularly after suffering battle damage. One critic claims that the [new destroyer is already outdated](http://thediplomat.com/2014/11/americas-newest-destroyer-is-already-outdated/). Who is right? Time and the sea will tell.
