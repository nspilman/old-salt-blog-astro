Sarah Young

Terrible news. [A second sailor has died in the Clipper Round the World Race](http://clipperroundtheworld.com/news/article/fatality-statement--sarah-young). On 1127 UTC on Friday, Sarah Young, 40, was swept over the side of the *IchorCoal* boat (CV21) in the Pacific Ocean by a series of waves, after reefing the mainsail. She was not tethered to the boat and was carried off in 35 – 40 knot winds. Her body was recovered but she never regained consciousness. The cause of death is yet to be determined but is suspected to be drowning or exposure.  Her death took place at approximately 39 N 160 E, approaching the International Date Line, on the 12th day of the ninth race between Qingdao, China, and Seattle, USA, with over 3,242 miles left to reach its destination.

Last September, four days after the start of the Clipper Round the World Race, [Andrew Ashman, 49, a paramedic, suffered a head injury and died](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/09/death-on-the-clipper-round-the-world-race/) while reefing the mainsail, also on the racing yacht *IchorCoal* (CV21).  In the last twenty years of the Clipper Round the World Race, these have been the first fatalities.
