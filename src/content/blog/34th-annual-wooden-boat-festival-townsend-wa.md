*Preparations for the 34th annual Wooden Boat Festival, which starts on Friday, are taking over downtown.*

*Port Townsend Bay, always littered with a variety of sailboats, is hosting more as the first day of the festival approaches.*

*Already in residence are the schooners Adventuress and Merrie Ellen. The Lady Washington, which is based in Aberdeen, was on display at full sail Tuesday afternoon.*

*Tents will begin to go up today around the Northwest Maritime Center, 431 Water St., which is headquarters for the three-day celebration that will run from Friday through Sunday.*

*Festival director Kaci Cronkhite, who has run the event for nine years, said it is unique because of the educational aspect that complements the standard festival elements of food and fun.*

*“People come here to learn about wooden boats,” Cronkhite said.*

*“There are more conversations than noise, and more questions than answers.”*
