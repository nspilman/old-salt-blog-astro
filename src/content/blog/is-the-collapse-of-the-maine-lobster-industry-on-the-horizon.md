![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lobsterbin.jpg)Today, the New York Times featured an article titled — “[Climate Change Brought a Lobster Boom. Now It Could Cause a Bust.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/climate/maine-lobsters.html)” The article suggests that while rising water temperatures due to climate change have brought a boom in the Maine lobster catch, increasing temperatures may lead to a collapse of the fishery.  This concern is nothing new. Five years ago, we posted “[The Ecology and Economics of Lobster – Will The Maine Lobster Boom End in a Bust?”](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/08/east-coast-lobster-fisheries-the-best-of-times-and-the-worst-of-times/)   Increasingly, the signs of a bust are becoming more ominous.

The [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/climate/maine-lobsters.html) quotes Dave Cousens, who stepped down as president of the Maine Lobstermen’s Association in March, “Climate change really helped us for the last 20 years.” But, he added, “Climate change is going to kill us, in probably the next 30.”

The Times also notes that “the Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than 99 percent of the world’s oceans for much of this century, driven by climate change in combination with natural variation. By 2050, that warming could cut lobster populations in the gulf by up to 62 percent, the Gulf of Maine Research Institute says.”

As we wrote in our [2013 post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/08/the-ecology-and-economics-of-lobster-will-the-maine-lobster-boom-end-in-a-bust/): Maine has been experiencing a lobster boom. After catching an average of 20 million pounds of lobster per year for decades, Maine’s 5,500 lobster-men landed a record 125 million pounds of lobsters last year.  Will this boom, however, end in a bust? … The question is important because the other ground fisheries in the Gulf of Maine; cod, haddock, pollock and hake; have been effectively fished out. Lobster accounts for 80% of the total value of the Maine fisheries. If lobster yields drop dramatically, the economic impact on the coast could be dire.

The prospect of a lobster fisheries collapse is not wholly hypothetical. The lobster fishery in Long Island Sound went through a similar boom and bust cycle in the 1980s through 2013, when lobster fishing was suspended to attempt to preserve the few lobsters remaining. 

Beginning in the 1980s, lobster harvest significantly increased in Long Island Sound, with the peak occurring in 1997. Catches rose from around 2.5 million pounds in the 1980s to almost 12 million in 1997. Then in 1999 lobsters began to die off, most severely in the western Sound, reducing the harvest to early 1980s-levels. Then around 2010, the lobster population collapsed. The 2014 harvest was less than one-tenth the average harvest landed in the 1980s, and only about 1% of the peak values observed in the mid 90’s. Scientists concluded that a combination of warmer temperatures and impaired water quality stressed lobsters, making them susceptible to disease and limiting their ability to reproduce, which caused a rapid drop in the population. Today the lobster population in Long Island Sound is barely holding on.

Lobster Landing Long Island Sound by Year

Will the Maine lobster population avoid the same fate as that of the Sound’s? The good news is that the geography and water quality issues are not the same in Maine as that of the Long Island Sound at the turn of the century. As waters warm, the lobsters may move to deeper waters offshore, which was not an option in the geographically bounded Long Island Sound. Also, Maine lobstermen practice strict rules to conserve and protect undersized and egg-bearing lobsters.   

Will it be enough? No one really knows. Curtis Brown, a lobsterman and marine biologist for Ready Seafood sums it up, saying, “We have a multimillion-dollar industry and a woefully inadequate understanding.”
