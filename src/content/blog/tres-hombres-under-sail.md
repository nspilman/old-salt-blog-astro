This seems like a suitable video for a Monday morning.  [*Tres Hombres*](http://svtreshombres.homestead.com/Index.html) is a Dutch 32 meter cargo-carrying brigantine, meant to serve as an ambassador to a new fleet of sustainable hybrid sailing vessels. The video below is beautifully shot footage of the *Tres Hombres* under sail set to soothing music.  What better way to start the week than watching a beautiful ship under sail on open sea?
