![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/06/No5Elbe.jpg)On Saturday, the restored pilot schooner [*No. 5 Elbe* sank following a collision with a containership](https://stiftung-hamburg-maritim.de/index.php?article_id=68&area=news&area_id=1295) on its namesake river at Stade, Germany. The 43 people aboard the 1883 built schooner were rescued almost immediately thanks to a quick response from five rescue boats which happened to be in the area on another distress call. Six adults and two children were injured, one seriously, in the collision.

An investigation will determine the cause of the collision between the pilot schooner and the Cyprus-flagged container ship, *Astrosprinter*. Current reports suggest that the schooner turned across the fairway, directly into the path of the container ship. The [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/09/newly-restored-19th-century-german-ship-sinks-after-collision) describes the course change as a “failed tack” by the gaff-rigged schooner. Other reports suggest that the container ship was outside the channel lane. 

The *No. 5 Elbe* was built by Gustav Junge in 1883. It served for 41 years as a pilot schooner before it was sold in the 1920s to American journalist Warwick Tompkins. Tompkins made several transatlantic passages with the renamed *Wander Bird* before he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. In the 1930s, the Tompkins family sailed the Wander Bird around Cape Horn — going the “wrong way” from east to west.  He later chartered the boat for trips to the South Sea islands. 

In the late 1960s, the schooner was acquired by Harold Sommer in the late ‘60s and underwent an extensive restoration by a cast of waterfront characters and legends, including Spike Africa, John Linderman and actor/sailor/author Sterling Hayden. According to [Latitude 38](https://www.latitude38.com/lectronic/the-sinking-of-wander-bird/), the project was deemed by the Smithsonian Museum to be the most significant vessel restoration done by a private individual in the US in the 1990s. 

In the 1990s, the schooner was acquired by new owners and allowed to deteriorate. In 2002, she was rescued by the [Hamburg Maritime Foundation](https://stiftung-hamburg-maritim.de/) and returned to Hamburg for restoration. It is unclear whether the schooner can be salvaged. The 85-ft length on deck schooner completed a $1.7m refit in a Danish shipyard only last month.
