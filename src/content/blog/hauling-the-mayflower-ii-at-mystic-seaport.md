I hope everyone who celebrates the American holiday is having a wonderful Thanksgiving. The holiday is associated with a group of English settlers now known as the Pilgrims who arrived on the Massachusetts coast around 1620 on the ship [Mayflower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower). Now, the [*Mayflower II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower_II), a replica built in Devon, England and sailed to United States in 1957, is undergoing an extensive renovation and rebuild. She was hauled last Friday at the [Henry B. duPont Preservation Shipyard](http://www.mysticseaport.org/locations/shipyard/) at [Mystic Seaport](http://www.mysticseaport.org/category/mayflower-ii-restoration/).

[Hauling the MAYFLOWER II at Mystic Seaport – November 2016](https://youtu.be/kkhEYSkKw_s)

From the [Mystic Seaport website](http://www.mysticseaport.org/news/2016/mayflower-ii-hauled/):

*This is the third phase of a multi-year preservation initiative for the nearly 60-year-old ship. Mystic Seaport shipwrights and Plimoth Plantation maritime artisans are collaborating on the restoration, which is being carried out to prepare the ship for the commemoration of the Pilgrims’ arrival 400 years ago in 2020. Unlike past years, Mayflower II will remain at Mystic Seaport for a period of 30 months and not return to Plymouth in the spring as she has in past years.*
