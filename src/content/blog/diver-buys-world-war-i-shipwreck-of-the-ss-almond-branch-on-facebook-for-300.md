![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/almondbranch.jpg)It is amazing what one can buy online these days.  Recently, [Dom Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/@D33pUK), 53, a diver and shipwreck aficionado from Portsmouth, Hampshire, saw an ad on Facebook Marketplace for a World War I shipwreck for sale for just £300. He couldn’t resist, so he snapped up the wreck of the 3,000-tonne *[SS Almond Branch](https://wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?77354).*

SS *Almond Branch*, a steam-powered cargo ship built in 1896, was torpedoed by German submarine UB-57 near Mevagissey on November 27, 1917, and has rested 58m underwater off the coast of Cornwall ever since. 

Every shipwreck has a legal owner. In Britain, the government sold a number of them into private hands to be salvaged after the end of the Second World War.

Robinson, who has a YouTube channel called [Deep Wreck Diver,](https://www.youtube.com/@D33pUK) contacted the seller, who happened to live nearby. “I’ve bought bikes off Facebook Marketplace with more hassle,” he said. “I was like: ‘Bingo, this is my opportunity to own a shipwreck.’ ”

After he paid the seller, Robinson received a letter from a government official known as the Receiver of Wreck, who is responsible for managing the ownership of shipwrecks. The letter listed Robinson as the legal owner of the SS *Almond Branch*.

“The government stopped selling shipwrecks twenty-odd years ago, but I always quite fancied owning one,” Robinson said.

Robinson understands that there is no money to be made from the wreck, but is still pleased with his purchase.“It’s a relatively well-known wreck in the local area, so I’ve dived it before. I knew what I was getting when I bought it,” he said.

“It’s still a pile of rusting iron, but you’re swimming around a pile of rusting iron and going: ‘Yeah, this is my pile of rusting iron!’ ”

Not everyone is as pleased with Dom’s acquisition. [His wife Suzi, 53, was ‘furious](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14638489/shipwreck-Facebook-wife-furious.html)‘ after finding out he bought the shipwreck.  She said, “What a waste of money – I just hope he doesn’t bring it up and put it in the garden”.’
