![victorystern2](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/05/victorystern2.jpg)Last week we made a post with the headline, [HMS *Victory* ‘Collapsing’ Under Her Own Weight](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/05/hms-victory-collapsing-weight/).  The headline was alarmist at best.  (We borrowed it from the [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-36254359), but that is no excuse.)  The historic ship will, of course, not be allowed to collapse under its own weight.  David Hayes of the [Historic Naval Fiction](https://www.historicnavalfiction.com/) blog was kind enough to pass along this very interesting video about the engineering behind the 136 metal supports being installed to support, or as the video refers to it , “re-support,” HMS *Victory* to control the bulging and racking of the hull.
