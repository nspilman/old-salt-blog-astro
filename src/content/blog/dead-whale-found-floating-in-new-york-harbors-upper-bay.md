![brooklynwhale](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/brooklynwhale.jpg)**Update:** The dead whale is now identified as a [sei whale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sei_whale). [One report says that it was hit by a cruise liner](http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140505/brooklyn-heights/dead-whale-beached-brooklyn-officials-say), possibly the *Norwegian Breakaway*.

Last month, [a 60 ton dead fin whale arrived in New York harbor](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/04/35102/), pinned to the bow of a container ship calling on Port Elizabeth, NJ. This morning, a 25′ whale was spotted floating near the [Brooklyn Army Terminal](http://www.bklynarmyterminal.com/), close to the 58th Street pier. The [New York Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/dead-whale-found-brooklyn-army-terminal-article-1.1779994) has reported that the whale is a sperm whale, although the photos posted appear to be a baleen whale, such as a humpback or fin whale.

The whale was towed by the Army Corps of Engineers to Jersey City, where the [Riverhead Foundation](http://www.riverheadfoundation.org/) will attempt to determine how the whale died. Initial reports suggest that a large gash near the whale’s dorsal fin may have been caused by a ship’s propeller. As we noted in our previous post, a [recent study indicates that up to 30% of whales found dead](http://uk.whales.org/sites/default/files/whales-and-ship-strikes.pdf) have shown evidence of being struck by a ship.  Ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear are among the greatest threats to endangered species of whales today.
