USS Nautilus

  

On this the 183th anniversary of the birth of [Jules Verne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne), it seems worthwhile to look at the submarines named *Nautilus*.    Click on any of the thumbnails for a larger image.

Robert Fulton designed and had built one of the first technically successful submarines in 1800 and named it [*Nautilus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus_\(1800_submarine\)). When Verne wrote his classic science fiction novel in 1870,  *Vingt mille lieues sous les mers, [Twenty Thousand Leages under the Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea),* he also named his fictional submarine, *Nautilus.* While named after Fulton’s craft, Verne was probably inspired by the newly developed French Navy submarine *[Plongeur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_submarine_Plongeur)* built in 1867, the first submarine in the world to be propelled by mechanical rather than human power.

Various fans of Jule Verne have attempted to reconstruct the fictional *Nautilus* based on the Verne’s not always specific description in the novel.  Three versions are shown above.  The fourth is the [*Nautilus* from the Disney movie](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKU0?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00005JKU0), which takes considerable liberties with the *Nautilus* of the novel.

The last photo is of the *[USS Nautilus,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nautilus_\(SSN-571\))* the first nuclear powered submarine, and the first submarine capable of sailing twenty thousand leagues under the sea.
