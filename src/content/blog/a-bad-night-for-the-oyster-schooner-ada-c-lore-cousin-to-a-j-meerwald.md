Ada C. Lore after the breakwater collapsed

A week ago at about 2AM, at least [50 feet of the breakwater in Eastport, Maine collapsed](http://bangordailynews.com/2014/12/04/news/down-east/breakwater-collapses-in-eastport-sinking-one-boat-and-damaging-others/) into the inner harbor. Pat Donahue, a local fisherman and caretaker of the 1923 schooner [*Ada C. Lore*](http://www.davidjonesclassics.com/sail/413/ada-c-lore-85-oyster-schooner-passenger-vessel/), suffered minor injuries when the breakwater collapsed. The Eastport pilot boat, Medric, was sunk and another 20 or so boats in the harbor were reported to be damaged. The schooner *Ada C. Lore* lost both her masts.

The *Ada C. Lore* has been sailing on whale watching tours out of Eastport for the last several years. Yet, even a passing look tells you that she is not a “Downeaster”.  At a glance, she looks to be a near twin to the [*A.J. Meerwald*](http://bayshorecenter.org/a-j-meerwald/), an oyster schooner and the Official Tall Ship of the State of New Jersey.

The two schooners were built for the same trade and are about the same age. *Ada C. Lore,* built as a Delaware Bay oyster dredger in 1923, is five years older than the *A.J. Meerwald*.  They are both about 85′ on deck and have similar beam and drafts. The *A.J. Meerwald* is six inches wider and about 6″ more draft.  The rigs were a bit different, but overall not so much. Their spoon bows and broad sterns show the same heritage. They may not be sister vessels, but they are certainly cousins.

We can only wish Butch Harris, owner of the *Ada C. Lore*, good fortune in re-rigging and repairing the grand old schooner.
