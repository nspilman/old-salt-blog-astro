![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bergebulk2.jpg)In a [press release](https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/berge-bulk-unveils-the-worlds-most-powerful-sailing-cargo-ship-301955883.html) on Tuesday, [Berge Bulk](https://www.bergebulk.com/), one the world’s leading dry bulk ship owners, announced the launch of its 211,153 DWT Newcastlemax bulker, *Berge Olympus*, with four retrofitted [BARTech WindWings](https://www.bartechnologies.uk/project/windwings/) by Yara Marine Technologies. The WindWings installation is part of Berge Bulk’s ambition to become carbon neutral by 2025 and marks the *Berge Olympus* as the world’s most powerful sailing cargo ship.

With four WindWings installed, each possessing an aerodynamic span of 37.5 meters height and 20 meters width, the *Berge Olympus* will save 6 tonnes or approximately 20% of fuel per day on an average worldwide route and, in the process, reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 19.5 tonnes per day. With these fuel savings and CO2 reductions, Berge Bulk is evaluating the potential of installing WindWings on more of its vessels that trade on routes with favorable wind conditions.

In addition to the installation of the WindWings, *Berge Olympus* has been retrofitted with a shaft generator system. The shaft generator is driven by the main engine to supply electric power to the vessel, thus saving fuel and reducing emissions. With a 1MW capacity, it is sized to eliminate the need to operate auxiliary engines while at sea. This installation is in itself ground-breaking and concludes a program that saw multiple vessels retrofitted with the technology.

James Marshall, Chief Executive Officer, Berge Bulk concluded: “At Berge Bulk, we are constantly striving to enhance our efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of our existing fleet. From 2008 until today, we have achieved a remarkable 46% reduction in our CO2 emissions per tonne mile, already surpassing the 2030 IMO target for reducing carbon emissions intensity. There’s still so much to do as we accelerate the transition to new fuel in the zero-carbon future. That is why we are proud to partner with BAR Technologies and Yara Marine Technologies to pioneer this WindWing system. The Berge Olympus is a testament to innovation and sustainability.”
