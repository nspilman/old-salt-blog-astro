James Cameron wants to dive to deepest part of the ocean – the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, 35,800 feet (5.8 nautical miles) below the surface.  To do so, he plans on using a [single person submersible designed to dive straight down, described as a vertical torpedo](http://deepseachallenge.com/).  The experimental craft, built in secrecy in Australia over eight years, also rotates on a vertical axis like a bullet fired from a rifle (although much more slowly) as it dives. The intent is to minimize the dive time so as to maximize the time on the bottom.  It sounds like a great idea, provided Cameron can bring the sub to a stop at the appropriate moment.

*The axis of his 24-foot-long craft is upright rather than horizontal, speeding the plunge. His goal is to fall and rise as quickly as possible so he can maximize his time investigating the dark seabed. He wants to prowl the bottom for six hours.*

*“It’s very clever,” said Alfred S. McLaren, a retired Navy submariner who helps to run a company that makes submersibles. “Nobody has done this kind of thing before. It’s a great idea, a tremendous idea.”* 

*He likened Mr. Cameron to “an underwater Steve Jobs — difficult to get along with but very creative.”*

*“He’s driven,” Dr. McLaren went on. “He put together a hell of a technical team.”*
