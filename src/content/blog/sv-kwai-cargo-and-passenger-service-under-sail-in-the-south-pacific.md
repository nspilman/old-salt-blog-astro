![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/svkwai.jpg)We recently [posted about crewing opportunities](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/06/sail-and-work-in-the-south-pacific-tiare-taporo-seeking-crew/) for the auxiliary-sail trading vessel *Tiare* *Taporo* operating from the Cook Islands. The *Tiare* *Taporo* is, however, not the only commercial sailing vessel serving the Cook islands. The [SV *Kwai*](http://svkwai.com/) will soon be departing on its 45th voyage from Hawaii calling on the islands of Kiritimati (Christmas Island), Tabuaeran (Fanning) and Teraina, (Washington Island) as well as the Northern Cook Islands of Penrhyn, Rakahanga, Manihiki, Nassau, and Pukapuka.

The SV *Kwai* is 43 meters (140 ft), with a beam of 7 meters (23 ft), draws 3 meters (10 ft), has a tonnage of 179 RT and is ketch rigged. While equipped with a main engine and generator, the goal is to operate under sail 90% of the time. SV *Kwai* has been carrying cargo and passengers between Hawaii and the Line and Cook Islands since 2006. 

The team behind SV *Kwai* includes Captain Brad Ives, the president of Island Ventures Ltd and the Senior Captain of the SV *Kwai*. He has 25 years experience in traditional sailing and commercial seafaring. KWAI is his third sailing ship conversion project. April Fountain or Mama Kwai is Brad’s wife and manages the office in Hawaii as well as being the Ships Agent. She brings many years of successful business experience in both her own and other businesses. 

In addition to all the other myriad of challenges inherent in running shipping operation, Captain Brad and Mama Kwai recently lost their home and office on the Big Island of Hawaii to lava in the current eruption of Kilauea.

If you would like to apply for a future position on board *Kwai*, or simply want to inquire about the vacancy status of a position, please send your CV and an application letter to [cargo@svkwai.com](mailto:cargo@svkwai.com) with Subject: Application.
