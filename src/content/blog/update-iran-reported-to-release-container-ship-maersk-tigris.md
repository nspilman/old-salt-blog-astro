Iran is reporting that it has released the container ship Maersk Tigris.  The ship had been seized on April 28th as it transited the Strait of Hormuz. Neither Maersk Line, which is the ship’s charterer, nor Rickmers Shipmanagement, which manages the ship, could confirm the ship’s release. Iran had claimed that the ship was seized related to a decade’s old commercial dispute.
