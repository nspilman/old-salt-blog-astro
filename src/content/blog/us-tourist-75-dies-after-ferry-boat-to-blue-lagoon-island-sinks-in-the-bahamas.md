![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/11/bluelagooonsinking.jpg)A popular, full-day excursion to [Blue Lagoon Island](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147416-d149861-Reviews-Blue_Lagoon_Island-Nassau_New_Providence_Island_Bahamas.html), from a cruise ship docked in Nassau in the Bahamas, ended in tragedy on Tuesday when a ferry boat loaded with 100 passengers rolled over and sank in choppy waters. A 75-year-old American woman from Colorado died in the partial capsize.

The [NY Post](https://nypost.com/2023/11/15/news/american-tourist-75-dies-after-bahamas-excursion-boat-capsizes-on-trip-to-blue-lagoon/) reports that the ferry was nearing its destination when conditions on the water began to deteriorate.

That’s when everybody was like … this is real, something’s happening,” American tourist Kelly Schissel said in a [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@kellyswitz/video/7301480855355067678).
