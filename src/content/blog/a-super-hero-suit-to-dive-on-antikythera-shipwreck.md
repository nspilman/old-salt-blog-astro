![exosuit-main1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/09/exosuit-main1.jpg)An international team of archaeologists and divers wearing an [Exosuit](http://nuytco.com/products/exosuit/) will be diving on the [Antikythera shipwreck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_wreck) this month. The suit is described as a [part robot and part submarine, and evocative of the suit from the “Iron Man” movies and their hero, Tony Stark.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/science/a-superhero-of-sorts-in-a-hunt-for-artifacts.html) With the [Exosuit](http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/news/article/archaeology-to-enlist-robot-suit-to-scour-seabed-near-roman-era-antikythera-shipwreck), [divers can descend safely to 1000 feet (300+ m) and stay for hours, without having to decompress](http://antikythera.whoi.edu/technology/exosuit/) on the way back to the surface. It is fitting that the most modern high-tech suit is using to explore the shipwreck that was the source of the most advanced high-tech device know from the ancient world, the [Antikythera mechanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism).

In 1901 sponge divers off the island of [Antikythera, Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera) found a strange device in a deep water shipwreck. It was bronze mass appearing to be a complex of gears and dials.  No one quite knew what to make of it, until almost 100 years later, advanced digital radiographs revealed that it was a complex astronomical computer capable of predicting lunar and solar eclipses and the motion of the moon in the sky. The device became known as the [Antikythera mechanism,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) and is believed to date back to around 87 BCE.  About the size of a modern laptop, the device is far more advanced than had been believed to be possible to be designed and built over 2000 years ago. It has been called “the world’s first computer” and “a mechanism of staggering genius.”

The Antikythera ship must have beem a huge trading ship for its time.  Intact artifacts from the wreck were spread over a huge area, about 197 feet (60 meters) long at depths ranging from 114 feet to 197 feet (35 to 60 m),  [Some have suggested that the wreck is not of one, but of several ships.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/07/roman-shipwreck-greek-antikythera-two-ships_n_2425868.html) The wreck contained the largest horde of Greek treasure ever found.  Bronze and marble sculpture as well as coins and other artifacts dating back to the 4th century BC.  Among the other treasures, the Antikythera mechanism came shore as a corroded mass of bronze. Only later research would reveal that it was complex instrument with at least 30 bronze gears capable of predicting the movement of the major astronomical bodies.

As reported by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/science/a-superhero-of-sorts-in-a-hunt-for-artifacts.html):  *Archaeologists believe it was not a unique device. Indeed, according to Dr. Foley, there are historical references to other kinds of mechanisms in early manuscripts.*

*“This is the kind of thing that quite literally wakes me up in the middle of the night,” he said. “I can’t sleep because I’m so excited.”*

The documentary below is 51 minutes long but well worth watching.
