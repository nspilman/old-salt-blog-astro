The new [America’s Cup AC75 monohulls](https://www.americascup.com/en/news/535_TWO-MORE-BOATS-NEW-DESIGN-DIFFERENCES) flying across the water on foils look like other-worldly beasts to a traditionalist’s eye. How does one sail those things? Very carefully, apparently.

![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/teamnjcapsize.jpg)The other day, [Emirates Team New Zealand](https://emirates-team-new-zealand.americascup.com/) was testing their boat, [*Te Aihe*,](https://emirates-team-new-zealand.americascup.com/en/gallery/409_TE-AIHE-FLIES.html) in Aukland’s Waitemata Harbour when they had what was described as a “little whoopsie.” While performing a foiling gybe – described as a particularly tricky maneuver – they became unbalanced, their bow reared up and their foils lost contact with the water. *Te Aihe* lost speed and slowly rolled on to its side. No one was injured and no damage was done to the boat, which was righted with the help of a support boat.

This is likely not to be the last AC75 capsize. Recently, Grant Simmer, eleven-time America’s Cup veteran and CEO of the [INEOS Team UK](https://www.ineosteamuk.com/), warned of possible disaster with the new high-tech boats. In an [interview on the team website](https://www.ineosteamuk.com/en/articles/187_Simmer-s-view.html?fbclid=IwAR0RPmhcEjA8Se-HkHLHYxDCoxFq0dSQfaTpZFIWVjepzjt-n1fJKjjMWdg) he noted, “You can easily capsize these boats, a big focus will be the safety of the crew – followed by trying to protect our physical assets.”

This is not New Zealand’s first capsize nor its most dramatic. In 2017, [Team New Zealand pitch-poled their foiling 50-foot catamaran](https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/93407960/team-new-zealands-dramatic-pitchpole-what-happened-and-how-did-the-crew-escape-unharmed) in Bermuda on their way to winning the America’s Cup.
