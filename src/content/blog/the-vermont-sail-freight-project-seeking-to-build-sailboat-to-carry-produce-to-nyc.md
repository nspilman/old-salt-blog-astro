Next Wednesday, April 10th, from 6-9 the Working Harbor Committee is presenting [Sailing Ships at Work – Past, Present and Future](http://workingharbor.com/). If you are in the New York area be sure to stop by. (Click on the banner to the right to learn more.)  The future of working sail may come in all sizes, from large sailing bulk carriers to the sailing barges that only disappeared within the last fifty years in parts of the world.  Here is a very interesting working sail project by Vermont farmer, Erik Andrus.  He is building  a sailing barge to carry non-perishable produce down Lake Champlain to the Hudson River and onward to the market in New York.  They are attempting to [raise $15,000 by April 25th on Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1746378042/the-vermont-sail-freight-project#). The barge, to be named *Ceres*, is already under construction and will carry 24000 lbs of cargo and requires a working crew of two. She draws just 2 feet of water fully laden. Thanks to [Bowsprite](http://bowsprite.wordpress.com/) for passing the news along.
