[Mark McCracken was out fishing](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-kayak-fisherman-mark-mccracken-fends-aggressive-hammerhead-n431431?cid=sm_fc) for bonito half a mile off Gaviota State Beach, near Santa Barbara, when a hammerhead shark started bumping and circling his kayak. Mark, to his credit, didn’t panic, paddled toward shore and kept striking the shark with its paddle as it approached. The shark “followed me all the way into about three feet of water,” McCracken said. “Even after I got out of my kayak and made it to the beach he was sitting right there…it was pretty creepy.”
