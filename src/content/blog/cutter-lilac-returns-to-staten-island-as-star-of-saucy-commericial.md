![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/05/lilacstern1.jpg)In her long and varied career, the historic cutter *[Lilac](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/home.html)* has had many jobs. She served as a lighthouse and buoy tender — bringing supplies to lighthouse and maintaining aids to navigation. She also fought ship fires and rescued the keepers on endangered offshore lighthouses. During World War II, she was armed with guns and depth charge, but never fired a shot in combat.

Yesterday, *Lilac* took on a more unusual role, as a star in a saucy television commercial.  Specifically, she was towed to the [Caddell Dry Dock and Repair](http://www.caddelldrydock.com/) in Staten Island for the afternoon to appear in a commercial celebrating the 1937 arrival of the Italian immigrants. Following the shoot, the *Lilac* was towed back to her berth at Pier 25 on the Manhattan side of the Hudson river.

While this may be the first commercial that has featured the *Lilac* on Staten Island, the *Lilac* is no stranger to the island, although this is her visit in over four decades. As the U.S. Lighthouse Tender *Lilac*, she called at the U.S. Lighthouse Service Depot in St. George, Staten Island. Assigned to the Fourth Lighthouse District, *Lilac* carried supplies to lighthouses and maintained buoys and other aids to navigation on the Delaware River from Trenton, NJ south to Lewes, DE. When the ship needed maintenance or upgrades to equipment, she went to the Staten Island Depot at St. George. Later, as lighthouses became automated, maintenance of local tenders was moved to the Coast Guard’s shipyard in Curtis Bay, MD and the depot on Staten Island was closed. Building 11, once the machine shop of the Staten Island Lighthouse Service Depot, is now the home of the [National Lighthouse Museum.](http://lighthousemuseum.org/)

*Lilac* is a 1933 lighthouse tender for the U.S. Lighthouse Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Decommissioned in 1972, USCG*Lilac* is now a museum ship owned by the non-profit Lilac Preservation Project. As America’s only surviving steam-powered lighthouse tender, *Lilac* is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is eligible to become a National Historic Landmark.
