![Brigg_Astrid_2008](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Brigg_Astrid_2008.jpg)On July 24th, the Dutch sail-training [brig Astrid sank after running aground](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/07/brig-astrid-dutch-sail-training-ship-lost-off-cork-ireland-crew-of-30-rescued/) on rocks on the Irish coast on the western mouth of Oysterhaven, near Cork.   On September 13th, [the ship was lifted off the rocks](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/09/salvaging-astrid/) using a 937-tonne floating crane and placed on deck barge. She was then towed to the port of Kinsale.  There had been hope that the ship could be salvaged, but after surveyors inspected the damage to the  95-year-old 136′ (41.65 M) brig, they determined that the cost of repairs would exceed the value of the ship. The ship will be taken to Cork to be scrapped.  Thanks to Erik Abranson for contributing to the post.
