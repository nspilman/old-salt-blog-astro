![all is lost movie poster](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/all-is-lost-movie-poster.jpg)“[All is Lost](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2017038/?ref_=nv_sr_1)” a new film by J. C. Chandor, starring Robert Redford is about a solo sailor whose 39-foot sail boat is struck by a floating shipping container while 1,700 miles off the Sunda Strait and which later sinks in a storm.  Redford is the only cast member and there is virtually no dialog. The movie has received rave reviews, particularly for Redford’s low key but gripping performance. I saw it yesterday afternoon and it is indeed much of what the reviewers praise – a well paced, intense and engaging adventure story with an amazing, if almost entirely mute, performance by Robert Redford, the unnamed sailor, who the the credits only identify as “Our Man.” Nevertheless, I left the movie theater disappointed.

It wasn’t that I was not engaged by the movie, but I kept being pulled out of the story by little things, details that didn’t make sense, as well as at least one obvious large omission. Unlike “Life of Pi,” which was explicitly fantasy, “All is Lost” is a realistic movie of details. When in the early scenes, the sailor uses a sea anchor to pull the container free from the sailboat, I thought, “OK, interesting idea.” When the sailor patches the hole in the boat’s hull with fiberglass cloth and epoxy, I appreciated how difficult it is to make such a large patch on a moving boat and worried if it will be strong enough. The details are what drew me into the story.

Unfortunately, they were what also pulled me out. Being a sailor is not necessarily a good thing when watching a movie about sailing.

I found myself, for example, annoyed and distracted by the companionway hatch boards. The boat used in the movie was a Cal 39, which does not have a bridge deck in the cockpit. What that means is that rather than having a raised section of deck, level with the top of the cockpit seats; the companionway, the hatch providing access to down below, is open to the level of the cockpit deck. This means that when the hatch boards are out, water in the cockpit can drain directly into the cabin. In “All is Lost” whenever the sailor came below deck, he put the hatch boards in and enclosed the sliding hatch, but when he went on deck he would drop the hatch boards below deck and appear to leave the companionway wide open. I thought “OK this is just editing,” but later, in a scene where the boat is knocked down and dismasted, when the boat pops up again, there is the companionway, wide open.  Miraculously the boat did not fill full of water through the wide open hatch.

OK, big deal. A continuity error. The problem is that there are many other spots where instead of being engrossed in the film, I was stopping to say “what?” The storm jib looked really big and why didn’t he raise the mainsail? A deeply reefed main would seem to make much more sense than an oversized storm jib and a furled mainsail. The trip up the mast in the bosun’s chair was a great scene, but seemed to have nothing really to do with the problems the sailor was having with his radio at the time. What about self-steering or an autopilot? There seemed to be neither, though the sailor spent a lot of time below decks. What wait to the last minute to fill a jug of fresh water? What wasn’t it filled already? And on and on.

The one really big omission in the movie, is, of course, an EPIRB, an Emergency Position Indicating Beacon. An EPIRB could have sent out a distress signal to alert passing ships of the sinking.  Why would an otherwise well equipped sailboat crossing the Indian Ocean not have an EPIRB aboard? The obvious reason is that it would mess up the plot of the movie. The screenwriter could have bothered to have had the EPIRB crushed in the collision with the container, an unlikely event, but one that would at least solve the problem.  A waterproof handheld VHS radio would have also made the sailor’s life much easier, (I have one for my kayak) but I can overlook that. An EPIRB onthe other hand seems too obvious simply to leave out or ignore.

By the time the sailboat sinks (not a spoiler, you see it happen in the trailer) I found myself wondering even about the major plot points. Just as the scene going up the mast in the bosun’s chair didn’t really relate to anything, so too the opening scene itself was a  red herring. The collision with the container is not what sinks the boat. It doesn’t really even contribute to sinking the boat. The terrible looking patch apparently survives the storm, as if evident by how long the boat stays afloat. The boat sinks because of damage from the dismasting, not from bumping into the container.

Finally, I realized after I had left the theater and was walking down the street, that while Redford’s gave a fantastic performance, that I still knew nothing about the character and didn’t care all that much either. We knew that he was American, male, affluent enough to own and sail an oceangoing sailboat, and that he had loved ones ashore. Was there a character arc to the movie? Not so much. It was a fine adventure film but not much more. Various comparisons currently being made to Hemingway, Conrad and Melville by other reviewers strike me as a wild excess of enthusiasm, at best.

Would I recommend “All is Lost” to sailors and those otherwise interested in sailing? Yes, I would. I can predict that it will be the best major motion picture about single handing that you will probably see all year — as well as the worst and only. The cinematography is great. Redford’s performance is wonderful. Unfortunately, “All is Lost” could have easily been a much better movie that it is.
