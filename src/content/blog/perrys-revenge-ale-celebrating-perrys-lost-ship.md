![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/revengeale.jpg)Last January, three divers, Charles Buffum, Mike Fournier and Craig Harger, announced that they had located the wreck of [Oliver Hazard Perry’s ship USS](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/09/wreck-of-perrys-uss-revenge-reported-found-on-200th-anniversary/) *[Revenge](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/09/wreck-of-perrys-uss-revenge-reported-found-on-200th-anniversary/)* which sank 200 years ago off the coast of Rhode Island near Watch Hill.   It turns out that Charles Buffum, in addition to being a diver and an amateur archaeologist, is also the owner of [Cottrell Brewing Company](http://www.cottrellbrewing.com/new/), which is celebrating the discovery with a new ale –  Perry’s Revenge Ale, a dark Scottish-style ale with an 8.5 percent alcohol content.  it is currently only sold on tap at pubs nearby the  Pawcatuck brewery, but is expected to be sold in 22-ounce bottles in liquor stores within a month.  I can only hope that it is distributed here on the banks of the Hudson River.
