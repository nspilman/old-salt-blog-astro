![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/gorch-fock2.jpg)Last Saturday, [we posted that the commander of the German sail training ship, *Gorch Fock*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/22/commander-of-gorch-fock-dismissed-ship-ordered-home/), had been dismissed from his command and ordered home after reports of a mutiny in November, following the death of a cadet.  Now there is a very disturbing article in [The Maritime Executive](http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/2011-01-26-german-navy-training-ship-dubbed-floating-brothel/) suggested that the range of problems aboard may be more extensive than originally known.

[German Navy Training Ship Dubbed ‘Floating Brothel’](http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/2011-01-26-german-navy-training-ship-dubbed-floating-brothel/)  
  
*A report leaked Tuesday details inappropriate behavior onboard a German navy training vessel that may have in part led to the deaths of two female sailors.*

*In a written report, Hellmut Koningshau, the government official put in charge of the investigation, details several lewd and inappropriate acts onboard the ship. His accounts have given the GORCH FOCK, a new nick name in Germany, the ship is now dubbed as “Germany’s largest floating brothel.”*

*Lena Seele, 25, was reportedly bullied into climbing a mast in November, where she fell to her death. Koninsgshau’s report claims that Seele’s death was so poorly handled (with a party thrown by the officers just days later) that following her death several cadets onboard refused to follow orders. The mutiny prompted an investigation. During the investigation several cadets have come forward with accounts of sexual harassment, bulling, and intoxication onboard the vessel. Another female cadet onboard drowned two years ago, her parents believe she was the victim of sexual harassment and are demanding a full investigation.*

*One cadet described being on the ship as being a lot like jail, with new recruits often being sexually harassed in the showers by officers. Additional reports claim that new cadets were forced into kissing the commander’s mud covered feet while he wore a blond wig, pretending to be Thetis the Greek water goddess. Pictures published in the German newspaper, Bild, show cadets being dunked into a dingy full of a dark slop and kneeling down in front of the “goddess” commander.*
