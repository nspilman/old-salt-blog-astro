The *Acushnet* was originally *USS Shackle* (ARS-9), a US Navy Diver-class rescue and salvage ship which went into service in 1944. During World War II, she earned three battle stars for coming to the aid of stricken vessels. In 1946 she began her 65 year career in coastal service when she she was transfered to the Coast Guard.   The *Acushnet* was the sole remaining World War II era ship on active duty in the US fleet.  The cutter is currently based in Ketchikan, AK.
