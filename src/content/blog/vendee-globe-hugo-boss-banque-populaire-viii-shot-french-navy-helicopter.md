Here is some remarkable video footage of the two leaders of the [Vendee Globe](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/) single-handed around the world race, shot from a French Navy helicopter from the [frigate *Nivôse*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_frigate_Niv%C3%B4se). The helicopter videoed [Armel le Cleac’h](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/55/armel-le-cleac-h), sailing *Banque Populaire VIII,* and [Alex Thomson](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/60/alex-thomson), sailing *Hugo Boss,* as they passed the Kerguelen Islands deep in the southern Indian Ocean. Le Cleac’h and Thomson are now in first and second places, respectively. Thomson, the only Briton in the race, has been sailing at or near the front of the pack, despite having broken one of his foiling dagger boards.
