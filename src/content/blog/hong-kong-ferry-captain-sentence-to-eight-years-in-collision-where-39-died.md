In 2012, [we posted about the collision](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/10/hong-kong-ferry-collision-kills-at-least-36/) between the passenger ferry *Sea Smooth* and the ferry *Lamma IV* off Hong Kong near Lama Island. The collision killed 39, all passengers on the *Lamma IV* .  The *Lamma IV*  was carrying staff and family members of the Hongkong Electric Company to watch fireworks in the city’s Victoria Harbour to celebrate China’s National Day and mid-autumn festival.  It was the deadliest maritime disaster in Hong Kong since 1971.

Today, the captain of the ferry *Sea Smooth,* Lai Sai-ming, was sentenced to eight years in prison after being found guilty of 39 counts of manslaughter. The captain of the *Lamma IV,* Chow Chi-wai, was acquitted on Saturday of manslaughter but found guilty of the endangering the safety of others at sea and was sentenced to nine months in prison.
