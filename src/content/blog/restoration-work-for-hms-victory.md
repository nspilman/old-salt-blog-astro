HMS Victory

Earlier this month [we posted about a report](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/10/hms-victory-rotting-and-being-pulled-apart-under-its-own-weight/) which features dire warnings about the condition of *HMS Victory*.     Thanks to [David Hayes](http://www.historicnavalfiction.net/forum) for passing along  an update on the restoration work planned for the old ship.

[Restoration work for HMS Victory](http://www.calverleytoday.co.uk/news/restoration_work_for_hms_victory_1_2963288)

*Major restoration work is to be undertaken to ensure that Nelson’s flagship HMS Victory in Portsmouth is fully preserved for future generations.*

*Recent survey work on the 18th century warship revealed that it was leaking, suffering from rot and being pulled apart by its own weight.*  
  
*The Royal Navy is now set to put out to tender the contract to restore and maintain the ship, which is the world’s oldest commissioned warship and famous for its role at the Battle of Trafalgar, for the next 10 years.*

*The current maintenance contract is worth £1.5 million a year but the Navy is not revealing the potential value of the new tender for “commercial reasons”.*

*A Royal Navy spokesman said: “HMS Victory is the oldest commissioned warship in the world and there is an ongoing programme of repair and investment to ensure that this iconic vessel is preserved for future generations.*

*“There are no plans to change her unique status as a commissioned warship and flagship of the second sea lord, nor for her to be sold.*

*“We are planning how best to ensure HMS Victory is maintained for the future and the Ministry of Defence is looking to invite bids in an open competition for her future maintenance.*
