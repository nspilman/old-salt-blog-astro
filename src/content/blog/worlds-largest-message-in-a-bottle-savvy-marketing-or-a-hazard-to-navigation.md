![solobottle](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/solobottle.jpg)The Norwegian soft drink [Solo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_\(Norwegian_soft_drink\)) produced by Ringnes, Oskar Sylte, Aass, and Mack is extremely popular in Norway but virtually unknown in the United States. To increase visibility in other markets, the firms have had built a 24′ (8M) bottle in which they will place a case of Solo, an orange drink, and a “*12 square meter personal letter to the finder.*”  The bottle is insured and equipped with navigation lights required for a drifting object in international waters, as well as solar panels, satellite-communications, tracking technology and a custom camera which will upload an image every 8 hours.  Controversial Norwegian celebrity-adventurer [Jarle Andhøy](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/jarle-andhoy/) will be on hand to launch the bottle from Tenerife in the Canary Islands, on Wednesday March 13th at 11.30am.
