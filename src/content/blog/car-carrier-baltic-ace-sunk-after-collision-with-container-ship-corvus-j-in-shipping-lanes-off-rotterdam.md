Baltic Ace

The car carrier, [*Baltic Ace*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Ace), is reported to have collided with the container ship, [*Corvus J*](http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Corvus-J-9262895.html), this evening in crowded shipping lanes around 60 miles off the coast of Rotterdam.  The *Baltic Ace* is believed to have sunk. Her crew of 24 took to life rafts and rescue operations are underway. There is no word yet on casualties. The *Cyrus J* is reported to be badly damaged but not in danger of sinking.

[The BBC report](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20616997)s: *The Baltic Ace was sailing under a Bahamas flag. It was transporting cars from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Finland when it collided with the Cyprus-registered container ship, the Corvus J, sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to the Belgian port of Antwerp.*

*The shipping lane where the accident happened is one of the busiest in the North Sea, close to the entrance to Rotterdam port, which is Europe’s busiest.*
