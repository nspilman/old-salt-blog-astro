Well before the billionaire’s AC72 catamarans were rising up on foils to race in the America’s Cup, nimble [Moth dinghies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth_\(dinghy\)) were flying on hydrofoils around the buoys. I will admit to being fascinated by the foiling Moths, although they appear to be rather challenging to sail. Perhaps beyond my capabilities. The Moths are light and relatively simple, while still being a wonder of design, engineering and fabrication.  Here is a wonderful [video by Onne van der Wal](http://vimeo.com/98343193) of a recent Moth regatta in Newport on Narragansett Bay, RI.
