*The Condor Vitesse, travelling between St Malo in France and St Helier, Jersey, collided with the boat at about 0750 BST on Monday.  There were three French nationals on the fishing boat. Two of them were taken to the Vitesse.  It is thought the fisherman is in a serious condition.*  
  
*The wreckage is currently being recovered by Jersey Coastguard.*

*The Condor Vitesse sustained some damage to the starboard bow but was able to get back to port under its own power and without assistance.*
