Admiral Makarov

As brutal combat continues in the eastern part of Ukraine, the war in the Black Sea continues to heat up.

Three weeks ago, [Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles hit and subsequently sank](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/04/moscow-burning-explosions-fire-engulf-russian-flagship-moskva/) the guided-missile cruiser and the flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet, [*Moskva*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cruiser_Moskva).  Previously, Ukrainian missiles [destroyed the Russian Alligator Class landing ship *Orsk*](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/03/russian-landing-ship-destroyed-by-ukrainian-attack-in-occupied-port-of-berdyansk/) in the occupied Ukrainian port city of Berdyansk.

Last week, the [Ukrainian military released video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btnBwUd3Fjw) of the two Russian [Raptor-class patrol boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor-class_patrol_boat) operating near Snake Island, being blown up in attacks by [Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baykar_Bayraktar_TB2).

Yesterday, there was an, as of yet unconfirmed, report that Ukrainian Neptune missiles hit the Russian frigate, [*Admiral Makarov*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_frigate_Admiral_Makarov), setting the ship on fire. The reported location is close to where the Russian Raptor-class patrol boats were destroyed by Ukrainian drones.

Today, the Ukrainians said that a drone hit destroyed a large [Serna-type Russian landing craft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serna-class_landing_craft) supplying a [TOR anti-aircraft missile system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_missile_system) to Snake Island.

‘Enemy units remaining on Snake Island remain without air cover and will be destroyed and burned out like cockroaches or locusts,’ said Ukrainian official Anton Gerashchenko.

The presumption that the Russian invaders would quickly dominate the skies above Ukraine and take complete control of the Black Sea is repeatedly being proven false.
