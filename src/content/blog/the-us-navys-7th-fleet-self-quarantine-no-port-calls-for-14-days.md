While some ill-advised politicians are referring to the threat from Covid-19, the rapidly spreading coronavirus, as a “hoax,” the US Navy is taking it very seriously. Ships in the [7th Fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet) has been ordered to spend at least 14 days at sea between port visits as nations in the region battle outbreaks of the new coronavirus, a Navy official told [Stars and Stripes](https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/pacific-fleet-orders-14-day-gap-between-port-visits-for-7th-fleet-ships-during-coronavirus-outbreak-1.620641) on Friday. The ships are effectively being put into self-quarantine. 

The directive was issued to the vessels Wednesday “out of an abundance of caution” to monitor crews and prevent the spread of COVID-19, said the official, who declined to comment on the record.

No 7th Fleet sailors have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the official.

“This is about protecting the force and preventing spread to our allies and partners,” the official said.
