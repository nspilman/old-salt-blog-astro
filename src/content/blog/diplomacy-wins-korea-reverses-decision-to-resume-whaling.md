![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Minke.jpg)When [Korea announced plans](http://articles.cnn.com/2012-07-04/asia/world_asia_south-korea-whaling_1_minke-whales-international-whaling-commission-southern-ocean-whale-sanctuary?_s=PM:ASIA), earlier this month, to resume whaling for “scientific purposes” it was hit by a tsunami of protests from environmental groups and nations around the world.  France, the United States, Australia and New Zealand in particular spoke out strongly against the Korean plan.  Korea planned to exploit the loophole provided for “scientific whaling for research” in [Article VIII of the whaling convention.](http://iwcoffice.org/commission/convention.htm)

Yielding to diplomatic pressure from countries around the world, [Korea has now scrapped its plan](S. Korea dumps whaling plan: report) to resume whaling.   South Korea has banned commercial whale hunting since 1986, but allows the sale of meat from whales accidentally caught in fishing nets. [Norway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling_in_Norway) and [Iceland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling_in_iceland) are the only two countries who engage in commercial whaling. [Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling_in_japan) engages in whaling for “research,” which critics argue is merely a pretense to provide cover for commercial whaling.  Thanks to Phil Leon for passing along the news.
