We have been following the construction of the [Dragon Harald Fairhair](http://den.vikingkings.com/), (or in Norwegian *Draken Harald Hårfagre*)  the largest Viking longship to have been built in modern times. (See our previous post – [Building the Viking Longship Dragon Harald Fairhair](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/14/building-the-viking-longboat-dragon-harald-fairhair/).)  Built of oak, in the town of Haugesund in Western Norway, the ship is hundred and fourteen feet, twenty-seven feet wide, displacing seventy tons, and will carry thirty-two hundred square feet of sail. She was recently launched and has begun sailing trials.  A short video of one of her first sails.
