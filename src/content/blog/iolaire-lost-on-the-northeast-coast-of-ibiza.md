![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/iolaire2.jpg)Sad news reported by [ClassicSailboats.org](http://classicsailboats.org/iolaire-lost-off-the-north-east-coast-of-ibeza/). The 114-year-old sailing yacht [*Iolaire*](http://classicsailboats.org/portfolio-view/harris-brothers-iolaire/) was lost off Ibiza in late July. She ran ashore after an uncontrolled jibe and sank. The crew escaped without injury.

*Iolaire,* previously owned for over half a century by well-known sailor and author [Don Street](http://www.street-iolaire.com/bio.htm), had the distinction of being the only more than 100-year-old yacht to have been in continuous commission since she was launched; cruising and racing during both wars.

From [ClassicSailboats.org](http://classicsailboats.org/iolaire-lost-off-the-north-east-coast-of-ibeza/):

*When Don Street purchased Iolaire in St. Thomas in March 1957 he realized that the big heavy main boom, left over from her gaff-rigged days, could be a real widowmaker in an inadvertent jibe. From the earliest days whenever sailing broad off, a main boom fore guy/preventer was rigged. This was often a difficult job.*

*Thru the years Street worked out various better methods of rigging the main boom foreguy. By the early 80s, he developed the rig whereby the main boom foreguy running from the end of the main boom to the bowsprit end and back to a midship winch or cleat, could be rigged with no one going FORWARD of the mast. It was ALWAYS rigged when sailing broad off or dead downwind….*

*This was obviously not rigged on July 26. About 0200 Iolaire was sailing dead downwind along the NE coast of Ibiza, an inadvertent jibe, she headed inshore, hit rocks and sank ending a 114-year career of carrying sailors safely thru thick and thin. Owner/skipper and partner got ashore in a liferaft.*

*Iolaire for 52 years carried Don Street, his family, friends, and various Grenadian crew safely throughout the entire Eastern Caribbean and seven times across the Atlantic, eight times up and down the Thames or St. Kathrine or Lime House basins, all with no engine. Don cruised, chartered, raced, explored, and wrote about the Eastern Caribbean and the Atlantic islands. The explorations resulted in the Imray Iolaire charts of the Eastern Caribbean and the Atlantic island. The writing resulted in hundreds of articles, three books and his all-inclusive Guides to the Eastern Caribbean and the Cape Verdes.*
