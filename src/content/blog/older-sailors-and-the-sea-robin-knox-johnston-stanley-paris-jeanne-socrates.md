Sir Robin Knox Johnston

An update on previous posts involving sailors of a certain age.  [Sir Robin Knox Johnston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Knox-Johnston), 75, sailing *Grey Power*, [placed third in the highly competitive Class 40 fleet in the Route Du Rhum race](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/sailing/route-du-rhum-2014-powerful-finish-sees-sir-robin-knoxjohnston-claim-third-place-9877950.html) between St. Malo in Brittany to Guadeloupe.  In 1968, he was the first sailor to circumnavigate the world non-stop in the [Sunday Times Golden Globe Race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Times_Golden_Globe_Race). Sir Robin was also the the second winner of the [Jules Verne Trophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_Trophy) (together with Sir Peter Blake) and in 2006, became the oldest yachtsman to complete a round the world solo voyage in the [VELUX 5 Oceans Race](http://www.velux5oceans.com/) at the age of 67.  He is also the founder and chairman of the [Clipper Round the World Race](https://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/).

Stanley Paris

In December and January last year we posted about the [attempted solo-circumnavigation by Dr. Stanley Paris](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/12/bon-voyage-to-captain-stanley-paris-and-the-kiwi-spirit/), then 76, on the *Kiwi Spirit.*  After a rig failure, [Paris was forced to abandon](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/01/update-paris-abandons-solo-circumnavigation-attempt-after-rig-problems/) the attempt. Now Captain Paris, 77, is back at sea after restarting his voyage, south of Bermuda in the mid-Atlantic. As reported by [Scuttlebutt Sailing News](http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2014/11/20/stanley-paris-returns-second-record-attempt/):

*American Stanley Paris had several goals in mind when he began his solo non-stop around the world attempt on December 2, 2013 from St. Augustine, Florida…*

*– Set a reference for time from St Augustine, FL*  
*– Set a reference for time from Bermuda*  
*– Set a reference for age (was then 76 years)*  
*– Set a reference for energy (green mode, using no hydrocarbons)*

Jeanne Socrates

Sailing is not solely the provenance of males, of course. Last year [we posted about Jeanne Socrates](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/02/jeanne-socrates-rounds-cape-of-good-hope-on-bid-to-be-oldest-non-stop-circumnavigator/), who at 70 became the [oldest sailor to circumnavigate solo non-stop](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2362101/Jeanne-Socrates-70-oldest-woman-sail-solo-round-world-non-stop.html).  It was the third circumnavigation for the grandmother from Ealing, West London, who only took up sailing at the age of 50.
