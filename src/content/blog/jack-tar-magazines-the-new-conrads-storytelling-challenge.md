*Joseph Conrad sailed and wrote during the demise of “The Golden Age of Sail” and the rise of steam and diesel. 100 years later, giant diesel-powered ships are already back to using sails in order to save fuel. What will shipping look like when oil becomes too expensive to power the thousands of cargo vessels upon which the global economy depends?*

*Create a story, 1000 words or more, that focuses on the maritime culture and/or the shipping industry in the post-petroleum future. Deadline is midnight, October 31st, 2011. A panel of anonymous judges will read the stories. Judges will not be made aware of author names until after the contest. Top stories will be published in the 6th issue of Jack Tar Magazine. Email all inquiries and stories to kim@jacktarmagazine.com.* 

*A single prize of $1000 US dollars will be awarded to the best story, on December 1st, 2011. Good Luck!*
