[![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fiber-optic-ship-burns.jpg)France Telecom-Orange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_T%C3%A9l%C3%A9com) announced today that an unexplained fire had broken out on Thursday on the cable laying ship, the [*Chamarel*](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?mmsi=645167000), in the Atlantic Ocean off Namibia’s [Skeleton Coast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_Coast) in the Atlantic Ocean.   The crew of 56 abandoned ship after attempts at firefighting failed to control the blaze.  The crew was picked up by a Namibian fishing vessel and taken to Walvis Bay. No injuries were reported.  The ship was returning from making repai to the [Sat3/WASC/Safe submarine cable](http://www.safe-sat3.co.za/) which connects Portugal and Spain to nine West African countries, circles around the southern tip of Africa, and connects to India and Malaysia.

As noted by Tim Conneally, writing for [Beta News](http://betanews.com/2012/08/10/legendary-fiber-optic-cable-ship-burns-to-a-crisp-on-skeleton-coast/):  “*The Chamarel, formerly known as CS Vercors, is actually a historically important vessel in international fiber optic communications. The ship was in service since 1975, and laid over a hundred thousand kilometers of cable, including AT&T’s TAT-6 transatlantic cable, and EMOS-1 the first Israeli-built undersea cable. In 2000, the vessel was used to set the record for the deepest submarine cable at 1,610 meters (just over one mile)*.”
