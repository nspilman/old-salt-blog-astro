![dead-whale-nj](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/04/dead-whale-nj.jpg)Whale sightings in and around New York harbor are getting less and less unusual. Unfortunately, the most recent sighting was of a dead [fin whale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_whale) caught on the bow of a container ship near Port Elizabeth. A necropsy is being performed to determine if the 60 ton whale was dead or alive when struck by the ship. Fin whales are the second largest whale in the world after the blue whale and are endangered. [According to recent studies, up to 30%](http://uk.whales.org/sites/default/files/whales-and-ship-strikes.pdf) of all whales found dead have shown evidence of being struck by a ship.
