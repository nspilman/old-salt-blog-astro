![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/03/ssus.jpg)At the beginning of October, the [SS United States Conservancy](http://www.ssusc.org/) announced that its board had retained the services of a broker to explore selling the [SS *United States*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States) for scrap “*over concerns about the organization’s long-term ability to continue financing the upkeep of the ship in the absence of firm redevelopment commitments and capital*.”  Since then the Conservancy has raised $100,000, which has given the organization some breathing room, although not much. With monthly expenses for berthing and other costs running at $60,000, the newly raised funds will not last long. Yesterday, the Conservancy issued a statement saying, in part:

*“Progress has been made due to your commitment and we are still compiling the necessary information to help the Board fully and responsibly evaluate our current situation from a financial and redevelopment standpoint. As a result, the Board has opted to defer any additional determination about the ship’s immediate future until later this month.*”
