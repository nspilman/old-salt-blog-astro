![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/07/iraniannavy.jpg)[US Naval Forces Central Command Public Affairs reports](https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/3448330/us-prevents-iran-from-seizing-two-merchant-tankers-in-gulf-of-oman/) that on July 5, the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer [USS *McFaul*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_McFaul) prevented two attempted commercial tanker seizures by the Iranian Navy. The Iranians opened fire in one of the incidents near the coast of Oman.

At 1 a.m. local time, one Iranian naval vessel approached the Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker [*TRF Moss*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:4157583/mmsi:538006543/imo:9732826/vessel:TRF_MOSS) in international waters in the Gulf of Oman. The Iranian vessel departed the scene when the destroyer USS *McFaul* (DDG 74) arrived on station. Additionally, the US Navy deployed surveillance assets, including [MQ-9 Reaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper) and [P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_P-8_Poseidon).

Approximately three hours later, the US Navy received a distress call from Bahamian-flagged oil tanker [*Richmond Voyager*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:5673160/mmsi:311000748/imo:9827683/vessel:RICHMOND_VOYAGER) while the ship was more than 20 miles off the coast of Muscat, Oman, and transiting international waters toward the Arabian Sea. Another Iranian naval vessel had closed within one mile of *Richmond Voyager* while hailing the commercial tanker to stop.

*McFaul* set a course toward *Richmond Voyager* at maximum speed as the merchant tanker continued its transit. Prior to *McFaul’*s arrival on scene, Iranian personnel fired multiple, long bursts from both small arms and crew-served weapons. *Richmond Voyager* sustained no casualties or significant damage. However, several rounds hit the ship’s hull near crew living spaces. The Iranian navy vessel departed when *McFaul* arrived.

In May, the United States increased the rotation of ships and aircraft patrolling the Strait of Hormuz with partners following an uptick in Iranian merchant vessel seizures. The increased force presence supports multinational efforts under the [International Maritime Security Construct](https://www.imscsentinel.com/) and bilaterally with partner nations to deter threats to commercial shipping and reassure regional mariners.

“I couldn’t be prouder of the entire \[US Naval Forces Central Command\] team, especially the exceptional effort by the *McFaul* crew, for immediately responding and preventing another seizure,” said [Vice Adm. Brad Cooper](https://www.cusnc.navy.mil/Leadership/Commander/), commander of US Naval Forces Central Command, US 5th Fleet and Combined Maritime Forces. “We remain vigilant and ready to protect navigational rights in these critical waters.”
