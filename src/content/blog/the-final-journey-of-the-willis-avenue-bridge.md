It is amazing what you can see passing through New York harbor.   Those awake in the hours before dawn this morning may have seen a highway bridge under tow down the East River around the Battery and across the Hudson River to Jersey City.  It was the [Willis Avenue Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Avenue_Bridge) which has spanned the Harlem River for 110 years once carrying 70,000 vehicles daily between upper Manhattan and the South Bronx.  The old bridge has been replaced by a new prefabricated bridge.  Plans are for the old steel to be cut up and recycled and the concrete to be used for fill.
