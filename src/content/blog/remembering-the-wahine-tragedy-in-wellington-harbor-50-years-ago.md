Fifty years ago today, the interisland ferry[*Wahine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEV_Wahine) capsized and sank in shallow water after running aground near the mouth of Wellington harbor in New Zealand. The ship had been caught in a storm caused by Tropical Cyclone Giselle. *Wahine* was a twin-screw, turbo-electric, roll-on/roll-off passenger and vehicle ferry owned by the Union Steamship Company which ran between Wellington and Lyttelton. When the ferry sank, 53 of the 743 aboard died, most by drowning.

Recently, photos have emerged of the ship taken by a young art student, Tom Palaskas two days after the *ship* was wrecked.  [Click here to see the photos.](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12025170)
