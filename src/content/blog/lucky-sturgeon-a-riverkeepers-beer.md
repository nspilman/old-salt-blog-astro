![luckysturgeonsign-LRae](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/09/luckysturgeonsign-LRae.jpg)In 2011, we [posted about the Elissa I.P.A.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/09/the-elissa-%E2%80%93-a-galveston-treasure-and-fine-indian-pale-ale/) (India Pale Ale) brewed by the [Saint Arnold Brewing Company](http://www.saintarnold.com/index.html), which bills itself as Texas’ oldest craft brewery.  The Elissa I.P.A. was named after *[Eliss](http://www.galveston.com/texasseaportmuseum/)a*, the official tall ship of the state of Texas.  Every bottle of the limited edition beer sold included a donation toward repairs to the historic ship.

Now, [two breweries in Westchester, NY](http://wamc.org/post/riverkeeper-beer-named)  — [Peekskill Brewery](http://www.peekskillbrewery.com/) and Elmsford-based [Captain Lawrence](http://www.captainlawrencebrewing.com/) Brewery — are teaming up to create an I.P.A. to benefit the [Riverkeeper](http://www.riverkeeper.org/).  The public was invited to help choose the name of the new brew. Of the roughly 300 names suggested, Lucky Sturgeon was the name chosen.

Michael Benz, Peekskill Brewery’s Brewery Ambassador, says it’s the first time his brewery has become involved in brewing for a cause.  “We figured if it’s going to be any cause it should be this one specifically because water is at the heart of what we do,” says Benz.  The City of Peekskill gets its drinking water from the Wiccopee Reservoir, part of the Hudson River watershed. Elmsford gets its drinking water from the New York City supply, which Riverkeeper works to preserve.

Lucky Sturgeon IPA will be available at a tasting at Captain Lawrence brewery September 26 and at the third-annual Hudson Hop and Harvest festival on the Peekskill waterfront October 4, where it will cost $5 for a 12-ounce glass.

[Riverkeeper](http://www.riverkeeper.org/about-us/our-story/) is a member-supported watchdog organization dedicated to defending the Hudson River and its tributaries and protecting the drinking water supply of nine million New York City and Hudson Valley residents.  For nearly 50 years Riverkeeper has been New York’s clean water advocate. They have helped to establish globally recognized standards for waterway and watershed protection and serve as the model and mentor for the growing Waterkeeper movement that includes nearly 200 Keeper programs across the country and around the globe.

The [Captain Lawrence Brewing Company](http://www.captainlawrencebrewing.com/the-beers/) is named in honor of [Captain James Lawrence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lawrence), the  American naval officer who commanded the USS *Chesapeake* in a single-ship action against HMS *Shannon.*  He is probably best known today for his last words or “[Don’t give up the ship!](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/dont-give-up-the-ship-one-of-the-odder-naval-battle-cries-from-a-forgotten-war/)“, which was invoked by Oliver Hazard Perry’s personal battle flag,  at his victory at the [Battle of Lake Erie](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/09/the-two-most-important-naval-victories-of-the-war-of-1812-part-1-battle-of-lake-erie/).

Thanks to Mai Armstrong and the Working Harbor Committee for passing the news along.  I am always ready to raise a glass for a good cause.
