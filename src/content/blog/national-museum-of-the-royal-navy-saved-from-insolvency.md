![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/victorybow.jpg)The [National Museum of the Royal Navy](https://www.nmrn.org.uk/) (NMRN) has [announced that it has been saved from imminent insolvency](https://www.nmrn.org.uk/national-museum-royal-navy-receives-emergency-funding) by a promise of emergency government funding. The museum group includes Lord Nelson’s flagship HMS *Victory* and HMS *Warrior* at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard and the frigate HMS *Trincomalee* in Hartlepool, among vessels and exhibitions at seven UK sites. 

The museum said the closure of its sites due to the coronavirus lockdown had caused a £6.35m shortfall which would have resulted in its filing for insolvency within the next month had the emergency funding not been granted. NMRN will now able to begin to reopen its sites in Portsmouth, Gosport, Hartlepool, and Yeovilton and will be making announcements about dates for reopening, in the coming weeks. NMRN said the government had indicated it would give [£5.4m to cover losses this financial year](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-53511647).

NMRN will not, however, be able to open its site in Belfast as HMS *Caroline* is governed by a different funding model via the Northern Ireland Executive.
