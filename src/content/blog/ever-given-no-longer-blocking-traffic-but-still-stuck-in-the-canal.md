![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/evergivenstuck.jpg)The [*Ever Given*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:5630138/mmsi:353136000/imo:9811000/vessel:EVER_GIVEN) no longer blocks traffic in the Suez Canal but, in a very real sense, the ship is still stuck in the canal. The [ultra-large container ship ran aground](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/03/suez-canal-still-blocked-by-ultra-large-container-ship-ever-given/) for about a week in late March, blocking ships transiting the canal in both directions. Although the ship was freed on March 29th and is currently at anchor in the canal’s [Great Bitter Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Bitter_Lake), it is not allowed to leave until unspecified damages are paid, according to officials with the Suez Canal Authority. While the shipowner has not officially heard from Egyptian authorities, there are [reports that the claimed compensation could reach $1 billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/ever-given-forbidden-leave-suez-canal-until-owners-pay-compensation-2021-4).

“The vessel will remain here until investigations are complete and compensation is paid,” Lt. Gen. Osama Rabie, who leads the Suez Canal Authority, told a local news station, according to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/suez-canal-has-reopened-but-the-ever-given-is-stuck-again-11617898144).

Even when the ship is finally allowed to sail, the cargo owners could be left waiting for some time before they receive their cargo. The shipowner, Japan’s Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., has declared a general average.

[General average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_average#:~:text=The%20law%20of%20general%20average,the%20whole%20in%20an%20emergency.) is one of the oldest tenets of Admiralty Law, dating back to at least 800 BC. In its original form, when cargo needed to be thrown over the side to prevent a ship from sinking, the principle of general average was that the other cargo owners would share in the loss.

In the case of the *Ever Given*, the declaration of a general average means that shippers will be required “to share the relevant expenses incurred in the rescue,” the [Evergreen spokesperson explained](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/ever-given-general-average-shipper-cost/597994/#:~:text=individual%20cargo%20interests.%22-,The%20Ever%20Given%20was%20stuck%20in%20the%20canal%20for%20six,owner%20declared%20a%20general%20average.&text=The%20last%20time%20a%20large,release%20their%20cargo%20by%20May.). The general average terms are outlined in a shipment’s bill of lading and can cover a long list of expenses, including towing and salvors.

The most recent large container vessels to declared a general average have involved fires. In 2018 following a cargo fire aboard the *[Maersk Honam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maersk_Honam),* the owner declared general average. The fire happened in March and shippers were able to pay to release their cargo by May.

More recently, in January 2019,  a cargo fire aboard the container ship *[Yantian Express](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hapag-lloyd-declares-general-average-for-yantian-express)* prompted Hapag-Lloyd to declare a general average. In January 2020, Ocean Network Express Holdings declared a general average on the container ship *[Northern Jupiter](https://gcaptain.com/general-average-declared-for-containership-after-engine-room-fire/),* following an engine room fire.

“Shippers with cargo aboard the MV *Ever Given* will be in for lengthy waits for their containers to be released,” the International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations [said in a recent note.](https://fiata.com/fileadmin/user_upload/2021_documents/General_Average_MV_Ever_Given.pdf)
