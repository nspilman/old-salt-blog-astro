Today the replica frigate *[l’Hermione](http://www.hermione2015.com/)* will sail from its mooring off the small island of Aix on the west of France, and navigate up the Charente river to the historic naval town of Rochefort, before setting out across the Atlantic to recreate the voyage of its namesake frigate which carried the Marquis de Lafayette to America with the news that the King of France had agreed to support the American rebellion against the British. *l’Hermione* is expected to arrive in Yorktown on June 5 to begin an tour of the east coast.
