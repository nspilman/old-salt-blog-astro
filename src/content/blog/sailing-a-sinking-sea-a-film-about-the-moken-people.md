More about the film from Olivia Wyatt:

*Almost every single Moken survived the Tsunami of 2004, thanks to premonitions from their shamans and ancestral wisdom gained from generations of living intimately with the sea.* 

*Numbering less than 3,000 they are the nomads scattered throughout the Andaman Sea and the Mergui Archipelago of Thailand and Myanmar.* 

*Living symbiotically with the sea they have a relationship seamlessly integrated with one of the most powerful forces in nature that it has manifested in living myths.*

*In the wake of the tsunami, the Moken have come under unprecedented pressure to assimilate into the mainstream and the mainland.*

*This culture is evaporating and along with it their vast wisdom of the sea.The Moken, are a sea-faring nomadic group living upon the Andaman Sea spanning from Indonesia to Myanmar.*

*This feature-length film explores their mythology, language, and relationship with the sea.*
