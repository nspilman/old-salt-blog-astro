![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dildoberg.jpg)Recently, [Ken Pretty](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1178804459517545&id=280342622697071&m_entstream_source=permalink&paipv=0&eav=AfZlsdr9q9_M1bbb87PeVtMlOQcfso90th0SqfGmBm_mrjARje_yWrr2ek-SGqJxIfM&_rdr), a photographer from the village of [Dildo, in Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dildo,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador), Canada, caught some remarkable drone footage of a 30′ high dildo-shaped iceberg off the coast of Harbour Grace in Conception Bay, Newfoundland. The photographs and video of the phallic-shaped berg, referred to as “dickie berg,” by the locals, quickly went viral after Pretty posted them to social media.

[Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/giant-phallus-shaped-iceberg-floating-in-conception-bay-surprises-residents-of-dildo-canada) noted however that the iceberg lacked staying power: Pretty photographed the 30-foot (9.1 meter) phallic structure on Thursday, April 27. It collapsed the next day. 

Back in 2016, we posted about [Newfoundland’s Dildo Island](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/07/captain-cook-dildo-island-twins/).  The name was first applied to nearby Dildo Island and apparently dates to at least 1711. No one knows the origin of the name. In addition to the town and the island, there is also the Dildo Arm of Trinity Bay and a point named Dildo Head. The town locals, called Dildoians, have an annual waterfront festival, [Dildo Days](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2629976817241993/). This year it will be on July 23-July 29.
