To celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Coast Guard Cutter *Eagle* and the 221st anniversary of the U.S. Coast Guard’s founding, the crew of the Eagle is also holding a photography contest for the best photo of the Coast Guard Cutter Eagle in New York.

The  *[Eagle](http://www.cga.edu/eagle.aspx?id=2558)* was built at the Blohm and Voss Shipyard in Hamburg, Germany in 1936, and commissioned as *Horst Wessel,* it is one of three sail-training ships operated by the pre-World War II German Navy. At the close of the war, the ship was taken as a war reparation by the U.S., re-commissioned as the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter *Eagle* and sailed to New London, Connecticut, which has been its homeport ever since.
