![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/11/lightningsealanes.jpg)Apparently, lightning strikes twice as often over shipping sea lanes than over the ocean as a whole. [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/why-lightning-strikes-twice-as-much-over-shipping-lanes/?fbclid=IwAR0vddGWNJL9RBa_ZpAQ-QDLh9u1HLq_PP_ifcUaOEpA5FgSz-TfJE1-srA) recently published an article about research that comes to that conclusion and suggests an answer to the question. They note that *it might sound crazy, but it’s true: The heavens cast their wrath and fury on the ships more than on the fishes.*

The article continues: *A comparison of lightning strikes between 2005 and 2016 in the eastern Indian Ocean and South China Sea (above) and shipping emissions (below) shows a clear correlation between where humans sail and where lightning hits.* 

*This may sound crazy—until you know a little bit about lightning. Under normal conditions, microscopic water droplets in the air grab onto “cloud condensation nuclei,” which are aerosol particles bigger than 50 nanometers, like a bit of dust, or sulfur dioxide. When few particles are present, each one picks up more droplets, and they coalesce into relatively short clouds at low altitudes. Those make rain. When a lot of aerosol particles are present, each one gets fewer droplets and can float high enough into the atmosphere to freeze. In the resulting tall clouds, those bits of ice and slush run into each other and transfer electric charges. The differences in charge create an electric field, which results in lightning.*

So, the research suggests that pollution and particulates from ships burning dirty bunker fuel create clouds that cause lightning. Because ships travel the globe in well-defined sea lanes, these pollutants can become concentrated and result in more frequent lighting over sea lanes than over the ocean as a whole.

The lightning itself is not terribly dangerous. An average of around 27 people died from lightning strikes yearly over the last decade in the entire United States. There does not appear to be reliable data on how many sailors are killed by lightning strikes every year.

The good news is that the era of dirty bunker fuel may be coming to an end. Cleaner fuel should reduce the particulates which create clouds that trigger the lightning.  It is a pity that we almost need to be struck by lightning to be reminded of why cleaner fuel matters.
