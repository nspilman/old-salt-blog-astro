I almost prefer visiting [Mystic Seaport](http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&page_id=1) in the wintertime.  The summertime crowds are gone, wood or coal stoves heat the chandlery and the rope walk and the ships are as lovely as ever against a winter sky.   Mystic Seaport is especially lovely around Christmas.   This year Mystic Seaport is hosting, [Christmas by the Sea](http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&page_id=A16824C3-1E4F-379B-60345B097C8926CE), a new holiday maritime experience, Thursdays through Sundays, November 26 – January 2, 2011, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

[Christmas by the Sea](http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&page_id=A16824C3-1E4F-379B-60345B097C8926CE)  
  
*Visitors are invited to enjoy an old-fashioned Christmas as they stroll through the Museum’s decorated 19th-century village, hear stories of seafaring holidays of long ago told aboard historic vessels, join chanteymen in singing songs of the sea and season, try their hand at candle dipping at the Buckingham-Hall House, print a Victorian Christmas card keepsake at the Print Shop and more.*

*Children will be able to make a souvenir toy of long ago at St. Nicholas’ Workshop, build a take-home creation at a Gingerbread Blast Workshop and play with 19th-century toys, games and puzzles in a new Pastimes and Playthings activity space. The Gingerbread Blast Workshop will be offered Saturdays and Sundays from 1 – 3 p.m. and includes a $5 fee.*

*Additionally, Mystic Seaport will host its first-ever Gingerbread Lighthouse Contest. The competition is open to all ages and each entrant will receive one complimentary Museum admission pass that will be valid through January 2, 2011. All submitted creations will be on display to visitors throughout December and prizes will be awarded in four categories – Youth (entrants up to the age of 12), Authenticity (judged on the reproduction of an actual lighthouse, lighthouse image must be submitted), Originality and Best Overall. All entries must be delivered to Mystic Seaport December 2 – 3 from 2 – 5 p.m. or December 4 from 10 a.m. – noon.*

*All Christmas by the Sea activities, excluding the Gingerbread Blast Workshop, are included in Museum admission.*
