[Why the Albatross Is Our Albatross](http://ecocentric.blogs.time.com/2011/03/09/who-knew-60-year-old-albatross-found-in-pacific/)

*Last month, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist spotted this Laysan albatross on the world’s most remote coral atoll, smack in the middle of the Pacific near Hawaii. The bird was first tagged by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in 1956, when she was estimated to be about five years old. That means today, she’s at least 60 — the oldest known living wild bird in the U.S.*  
  
*Aptly named Wisdom, the albatross was found hanging out in the Midway Atoll Wildlife Refuge to raise a chick she had recently hatched. Bruce Peterjohn, head of the USGS North American Bird Banding Program, estimates Wisdom has probably raised between 30 and 35 birds in her lifetime. After years of courtship, albatross mate for life, lay about one egg per year and take another year to raise their hatchlings.*

*About her travel habits, USGS writes:*

*Almost as amazing as being a parent at 60 is the number of miles this bird has likely logged – about 50,000 miles a year as an adult – which means that Wisdom has flown at least 2 to 3 million miles since she was first banded. Or, to put it another way, that’s 4 to 6 trips from the Earth to the Moon and back again with plenty of miles to spare.*

Thanks to Phil Leon for passing along the story.
