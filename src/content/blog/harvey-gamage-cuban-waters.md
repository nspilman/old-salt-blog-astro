The last time [we posted about the schooner](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/07/ocean-classrooms-spirit-of-massachusetts-harvey-gamage-westward-to-be-auctioned/) [*Harvey Gamage*](http://www.tallshipsportland.com/harvey-gamage/), was in 2014, when she and several other vessels were due to be sold at auction following the failure of the Ocean Classroom Foundation. She was subsequently purchased by Phineas Sprague and refit at his [Portland Yacht Services](http://www.portlandyacht.com/) in Portland, ME. *Harvey Gamage* was built in 1973 in the [Harvey Gamage yard](http://www.gamageshipyard.com/history/) of South Bristol, ME and is a gaff-rigged wooden schooner with a sparred length of 131 feet. She is now managed by [Ocean Passages](http://www.ocean-passages.org/#modern-organic-thai) which operates programs between Maine and Cuba. Here is a wonderful video of the schooner in Cuban waters.
