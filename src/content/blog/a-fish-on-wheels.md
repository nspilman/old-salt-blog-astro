I am not sure why I find this to be so amusing.   Here is a fish controlling a small robotic car by swimming around in a small tank. Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing along the story. As described by the designers at [Studio diip](http://www.studiodiip.com/):

*By using a camera and computer vision software it is possible to make a fish control a robot car over land. By swimming towards an interesting object, the fish can explore the world beyond the limits of his tank.*
