![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/qliznyc.jpg)The Royal Navy aircraft carrier [HMS *Queen Elizabeth*](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/surface-fleet/aircraft-carriers/hms-queen-elizabeth) has [arrived in New York harbor](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2022/september/25/20220925-qnlz-in-nyc), dropping anchor within sight of the Statue of Liberty. The carrier is accompanied by her frigate escort, [HMS *Richmond*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Richmond_\(F239\)), which sailed up the Hudson River for a berth on Manhattan Island. 

The 65,000-tonne carrier will serve as the floating conference center for the 5th [Atlantic Future Forum](https://www.atlanticfutureforum.com/) – an event that brings together the brightest minds and most influential thinkers from defense and beyond to strengthen UK and US bonds.

The carrier was welcomed into New York by the United Kingdom’s Ambassador to the United States, Dame Karen Pierce.

“HMS *Queen Elizabeth* is not only the United Kingdom’s flagship but is a fantastic demonstration of the soft power and the close working relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the transatlantic relationship,” she said.

“It’s an enormous honor to sail into New York on her. We share an endeavor in remaining the United States’ closest ally and I am very proud of what the ship has achieved for Britain in her deployment to the Indo-Pacific last year.”

Over the next few days, Captain Ian Feasey, HMS *Queen Elizabeth*’s Commanding Officer, will welcome hundreds of guests to the ship, which has been transformed into a unique, world-class conference venue for the forum.

“It is an amazing privilege to bring HMS *Queen Elizabeth* back to New York and to be formally welcomed to the United States by His Majesty’s Ambassador,” he said.

“We are very much looking forward to hosting the fifth Atlantic Future Forum and welcoming onboard senior leaders that embody our deep and special relationship with the United States.”

The HMS *Prince of Wales*, sister-carrier to the *Queen Elizabeth*, was originally scheduled to host the forum but suffered a starboard propeller shaft coupling failure in early September that took the ship out of service.
