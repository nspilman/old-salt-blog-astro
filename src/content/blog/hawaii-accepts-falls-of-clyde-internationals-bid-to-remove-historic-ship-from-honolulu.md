![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/FOCnow2.jpg)Great news! David O’Neill, director of the [Falls of Clyde International](https://www.foci.scot/), announced yesterday on Facebook that their bid to remove the historic tall ship [*Falls of Clyde*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_of_Clyde_\(ship\)), from Honolulu harbor, has been accepted by the state officials at the Department of Transportation (Harbors) in Hawaii.

The *Falls of Clyde*, launched in 1878 in Port Glasgow, Scotland, is the only remaining iron-hulled four-masted full-rigged ship and the only surviving sail-driven oil tanker in the world.  

From their [announcement](https://www.facebook.com/savefallsofclyde/photos/a.1399761533373145/5181461798536414):

Now we can work with engineering support to make plans to bring her home to Scotland, where it is planned that she will be rebuilt to sail the oceans as she once did. It is proposed that having established significant new technology contacts at the recent COP26 event – and in typical Clyde Shipbuilding history – she will become a demonstrator vessel for clean emission innovative technologies.

We are happy to talk to potential partners, solutions providers, event sponsors and investors, interested in clean emission Sailcargo, education at sea and skills training with communities as part of the process.

She is finally coming home!

Donations to help rebuild the *Falls of Clyde* can be made at, [www.foci.scot](https://www.foci.scot/?fbclid=IwAR0nrLJh99rogH6Q9Ng2WLGbISogXPLHc7oDR8ecMmkzUybYZUyepbGm6IY)
