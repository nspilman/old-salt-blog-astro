![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/12/dorade2.jpg) Four years ago, the yacht racing world was caught aback when [*Dorade*, a yacht designed by Olin Stephens II  and delivered in 1930, won the 2013 Transpac Race](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/07/vintage-yacht-dorade-wins-transpac-again-77-years-after-first-transpac-victory/). *Dorade* has previously won the Transpac 77 years before.  Now the 87-year old [*Dorade* has placed a very respectable second](http://dorade.org/2017/12/30/dorade-finishes-sydney-hobart-race/) in her division under both [IRC and ORCi](http://www.sailing.org.au/irc-and-orci-ratings-in-australia/) in the Sydney Hobart Race.

About *Dorade* from the [Rolex Sydney Hobart Race 2017 website](http://www.rolexsydneyhobart.com/the-yachts/2017/dorade/): *From the Famous American classic wooden boat Dorade is a revolutionary S&S, designed by a then 21 year-old Olin Stephens and built under younger brother Rod’s (20) supervision. Features a deep keel with external ballast, very narrow beam and a generous sail plan. The yawl took the yachting world by storm and made headlines around the world after scoring an upset victory in the 1931 Transatlantic Race from Newport, Rhode Island to Plymouth, competing against much larger boats. In the next 10 years, Dorade scored overall victories in the 1931 and 1933 Fastnet races and the 1936 TransPac Race. Adrienne Cahalan, the first woman to sail 25 Hobarts, is navigating.* 

*Matt Brooks and his partner Pam Rorke Levy purchased Dorade in 2010 and spent a year restoring her with the aim of competing in all the major races she had won. Since, she has beaten her Transatlantic, Newport-Bermuda, Fastnet and TransPac times of the 1930’s and made the podium of all, winning the 2013* TransPac *overall into the bargain. Arriving in Australia this year, she placed third overall in the Brisbane Keppel race and 14th in the recent Newcastle Bass Island Race. The oldest boat in the fleet at 87, this is her and Brooks’ first Hobart.*
