Just over a week ago, we here in New York and New Jersey were hit by a “superstorm,”  the convergence of Hurricane Sandy and a [Noreaster.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nor'easter)  Now just as power is being restored to many areas and damage to washed out neighborhoods is being assessed, a second Nor’easter is bearing down on us with rain, snow and high winds.  Many are asking what’s next?  Plagues of locusts? Sea monsters?   In that vein, here is a “proof-of-concept” for a feature film about sushi chefs fighting sea monsters.  Because you never know.
