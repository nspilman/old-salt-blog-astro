![hmcs-mermaid](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/hmcs-mermaid.jpg)We recently posted about how [Cathryn R. Newton, dean emerita from Syracuse University’s College of Arts and Sciences](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/09/06/syracuse-university-dean-creates-database-to-locate-shipwrecks/), has developed a searchable database that details 2,038 shipwrecks dating from 1526.  Thanks to Dick Kooyman for pointing out [Australia’s National Shipwrecks database](http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/heritage/nsd/nsd_list.pl), a searchable database of Australian shipwrecks.

The database is accessible through the [Australian Government Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts web site](http://www.environment.gov.au/index.html) which also has some very interesting sections on [historic shipwrecks](http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/shipwrecks/index.html) which includes pages on f[amous Australian shipwrecks](http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/shipwrecks/australian.html), [shipwreck trails](http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/shipwrecks/trails.html), and South Australia’s [graveyard of ships](http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/heritage/ships_graveyards/index.html). Definitely worth checking out.
