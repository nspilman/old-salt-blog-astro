From 1862 to 1956, yachts competing in the [America’s Cup](http://www.britannica.com/topic/Americas-Cup) were required to sail to the races “on their own bottoms.”   My, how things have changed. Today, the AC 45 foiling catamarans sailing in the current America’s Cup Races in Bermuda are far more like giant foiling beach cats than ocean-going yachts.  On the other hand, they are both fast and fun. Here is the [Oracle Team USA AC45 capsizing](http://oracle-team-usa.americascup.com/en/news/173_ORACLE-TEAM-USA-capsize-during-training-in-Bermuda-no-injuries.html). Fortunately, no one was injured and no damage was done to the boat.
