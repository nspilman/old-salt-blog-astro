Today, we learn that the sub has been towed back to base after suffering a serious failure in its hydraulic system.   The newspapers are pointing out that had the such a failure could have ” killed its entire crew.”

*The hi-tech stealth vessel was taken to the Faslane Naval Base on the Clyde late on Friday when it suffered “a technical issue with hydraulics”, according to a Ministry of Defence (MoD) source.*

*“This needs to be fixed to make sure it can dive properly,” the source said. “It could take days, or it could take weeks.”*

*Experts say that the boat’s hydroplanes, which enable it to dive or surface, are hydraulically controlled. If they fail, the boat could be lost, along with its entire crew of 98*
