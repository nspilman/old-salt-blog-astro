![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/icerose.jpg)The Danish Ministry of Defense has confirmed that the Russian Navy corvette, *Kazanets*, collided with the refrigerated cargo vessel, *[Ice Rose](https://www.balticshipping.com/vessel/imo/8311106),* in dense fog, near the Øresund Bridge, which spans the entrance to the Baltic.  

The Russian ship, a [Parchim-class corvette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchim-class_corvette), is reported to have been operating with this AIS turned off. The corvette is said to have suffered a hull breach above the waterline and to have proceeded under its own power toward the Baltiysk Naval Base, Kaliningrad Region, Russia.

The merchant ship, *Ice Rose*, is reported to have suffered significant damage and is anchored south of the Øresund Bridge awaiting a determination of seaworthiness. *Ice Rose* is a 14567 DWT ship carrying refrigerated containers. The ship is owned by Maestro Ship Management.
