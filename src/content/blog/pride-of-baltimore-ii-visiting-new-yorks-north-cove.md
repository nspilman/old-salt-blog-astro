[War of 1812 Privateer Pride of Baltimore II Returns to New York Harbor August 24 to 26](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ijzmlfcpekism6m/War%20of%201812%20Privateer%20Sailing%20Into%20New%20York.pdf)

*Pride of Baltimore II is a reproduction of a Baltimore built Topsail Schooner; the sleek, maneuverable vessels used as privateers during the War of 1812. The original “pride of Baltimore”, Chasseur, defended America’s freedom by serving as an offensive weapon of war and blockade-runner. Sailing out of New York Harbor in 1814 under the command of the intrepid Captain Thomas Boyle, Chasseur executed a one ship blockade of the British Isles, wreaking havoc on British merchant shipping.*
