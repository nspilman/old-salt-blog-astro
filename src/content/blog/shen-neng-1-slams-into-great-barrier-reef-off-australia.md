*The Shen Neng 1 crashed into the reef at full speed a few hours after leaving the port of Gladstone, the Australian authorities said. The ship, which was nine miles outside its authorized shipping lane, was hauling 72,000 tons of coal and had 1,000 tons of bunker fuel aboard.*

*Australian officials warned that the vessel was in danger of breaking apart, and there were reports on Sunday night of traces of oil leaking from the vessel. An Australian aircraft reportedly dropped chemical dispersants on the oil.*
