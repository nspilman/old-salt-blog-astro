![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/admiraldavids2.jpg)The [Navy](https://www.military.com/navy) has nominated [Rear Adm. Yvette Davids](https://www.navy.mil/Leadership/Flag-Officer-Biographies/Search/Article/2236396/rear-admiral-yvette-davids/) to become the first female superintendent of the [U.S. Naval Academy](https://www.military.com/base-guide/us-naval-academy) at Annapolis, Maryland. Unfortunately, her confirmation is being delayed, as are the promotions of over 180 fellow senior military officers, by [Senator Tommy Tuberville (R, Alabama), who is blocking promotions](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/25/sen-tommy-tuberville-blocks-military-promotions-abortion-pentagon/11737649002/) as part of his protest against the Pentagon’s new abortion policy. 

[Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/04/21/navy-names-first-woman-lead-naval-academy.html) notes that Davids, who became a naval officer in 1989, has commanded the frigate USS *Curts*, the cruiser USS *Bunker Hill*, and she was the commander of Carrier Strike Group 11. Her assignment to *Curts* made her the first Hispanic American woman to command a Navy warship. She was also one of the first Hispanic American women to command a carrier strike group.

The academy post would be a homecoming for Davids, who graduated from the academy in 1989. Her husband, [Rear Adm. Keith Davids](https://www.navy.mil/Leadership/Flag-Officer-Biographies/Search/Article/2236437/rear-admiral-b-keith-davids/), graduated in 1990, and the pair were both on the schools’ sailing team, Colleen Krueger, a spokeswoman for the academy, confirmed.

Keith Davids is currently the commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, and he had command roles on several Navy SEAL Teams over his career. The pair have twin children together. They are believed to be the Navy’s first married couple to both become admirals.

Tuberville is blocking military nominees from quick confirmation over his opposition to the Pentagon’s recently announced travel and leave policies for troops seeking reproductive care. While Tuberville cannot single-handedly prevent nominees from being confirmed, his objection significantly delays confirmations since the Senate has to find floor time to hold roll-call votes on more than 180 nominees who would typically be approved in a voice vote in a single batch.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin say the promotions are critical to military readiness, and Tuberville is blocking pay raises and preventing key leaders from taking their posts. 

“One senator is jeopardizing America’s national security,” Warren said on the Senate floor.
