South Korean icebreaker Araon

The South Korean icebreaker *Araon* and the fishing vessel *Chiyo Maru No 3* may reach the stricken Russian fishing vessel *Sparta* on Christmas Day. The *Sparta* is a 157 feet long fishing vessel with a crew of 32 aboard which was [holed below the waterline after striking sea ice in the Ross Sea off Antarctica on December 16th](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/16/russian-fishing-vessel-sparta-listing-after-striking-sea-ice-in-antarctica/). Supplies, including two pumps and material to patch the damaged hull, have been [air-dropped to the ship by the Royal New Zealand Air Force.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/18/update-spartas-condition-precarious-with-help-days-away/) With the new pumps and repairs made by the crew the *Sparta* is reportedly no longer in danger of sinking.  The icebreaker *Araon* will clear a path through the ice for *Sparta* and the *Chiyo Maru No 3*, which is a sister vessel to the *Sparta*.
