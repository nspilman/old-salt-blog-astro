[Whales found dead on Donegal beach](http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1106/whales.html)  
  
*Thirty-five whales have beached and died on an island off Burtonport in Co Donegal.   The whales were discovered this afternoon on a beach on Rutland Island and are understood to be pilot whales, mostly mothers and calves.   The whales had been seen feeding in the area around Aranmore Island since Tuesday.*

*Pilot whales have a tendency to beach themselves in large numbers and a similar incident occurred in Co Mayo some years ago.*
