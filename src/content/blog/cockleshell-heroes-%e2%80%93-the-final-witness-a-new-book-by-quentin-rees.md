![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/01/cockleshell.jpg)On the night of December 7,1942 ten British commandos set off in five wood and canvas canoes from a British submarine in the Bay of Biscay off the coast of occupied France. Their intent was to paddle 75 miles up the Gironde estuary and attack and sink German ships with limpet mines in the harbor of Bordeaux.   Only two of the ten commandos survived but they succeeded in sinking one ship and severely damaging four others, as well as disrupting port operations for months.  The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill believed the mission shortened the Second World War by six months.

Much has been written about the commandos who would become known as the “Cockleshell Heroes,” but apparently there are gaps inthe information about those who died in the raid.  Quentin Rees has recently written *[Cockleshell Heroes – The Final Witness](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184868861X?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=184868861X)* to answer the remaining questions about their fate.    The  book is available from [Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cockleshell-Heroes-Witness-Quentin-Rees/dp/184868861X/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1294267329&sr=8-1-fkmr0).    It has not yet been released in the US but can be pre-ordered from [Amazon in the US](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184868861X?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=184868861X).  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for passing the article along.
