Named the [Dragon Harald Fairhair](http://den.vikingkings.com/), (or in Norwegian *Draken Harald Hårfagre*) she is the largest Viking longship to have been built in modern times and is due to be launched in the Summer of 2012. Here is a fascinating video which looks at the construction of the ancient [clinker-built](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinker_\(boat_building\)) ship.
