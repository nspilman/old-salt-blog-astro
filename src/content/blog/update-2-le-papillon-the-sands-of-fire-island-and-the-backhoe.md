[An update to a story that we have been following.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/04/08/the-sands-of-fire-island-le-papillon-and-gluckauf/) The 50′ schooner *Le Papillon* came ashore on a beach  on Fire Island, northeast of New York harbor, at the beginning of April.   Just as it looked like the schooner would be swallowed up by the shifting sands, some folks with a large backhoe and what looks like an earth mover, secured chains to the stricken vessel and draggedher off the beach.  Fortunately the  schooner is built of steel.  It is hard to judge how much damage has been done but the vessel is no longer in danger of being swallowed up by the Fire Island’s sands.
