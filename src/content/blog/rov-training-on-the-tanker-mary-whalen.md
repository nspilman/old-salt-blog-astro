![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/41496_1792892409_8957_n.jpg)Yesterday we posted about the [New York Police Department Harbor Unit’s use of ROVs](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/10/videorays-the-submarine-drones-of-new-york-harbor/) to maintain security in the harbot.  We had missed an [amusing post](http://www.portsidetanker.blogspot.com/#!/2011/12/npyd-security-training-on-mary-whalen.html) by [Portside New York](http://portsidenewyork.org/)‘s Carolina Salguero on [NPYD security training on the MARY A. WHALEN](http://www.portsidetanker.blogspot.com/#!/2011/12/npyd-security-training-on-mary-whalen.html).  From her [post](http://www.portsidetanker.blogspot.com/#!/2011/12/npyd-security-training-on-mary-whalen.html):

*The NYPD trained officers on how to use the new cameras on the MARY A. WHALEN during May of 2007.*

*An NYPD boat came along side, and an officer in sunglasses skipped over introductions and said “can we look at your bottom with an underwater camera?”* 

*I said, “I don’t show my bottom to just any guy… who’s asking?”* 

*Without the hint of a laugh, Detective Keith Duval handed over a card and said he was with the Counter Terrorism Division.*   
  
*“All the big stuff is either busy or moving,” he explained; so the Mary Whalen would be helpful to him to use. He said the cameras cost some $80,000.*

*[PortSide](http://www.portsidenewyork.org/index.htm) uses the [MARY A. WHALEN](http://www.portsidenewyork.org/mary_whalen.htm) as an educational resource in diverse ways and for diverse groups. We have given TankerTours to the general public in [English](http://bit.ly/PortSideOHNYshiptours) and [Spanish](http://bit.ly/fSKGZB%20).  We have helped train college professors in a [City Tech program](http://bit.ly/CityTech). We have run workshops and lectures ([TankerTalks](http://www.youtube.com/portsidenewyork#p/u/7/-q3TPVRP9PQ)) aboard, and we’ve helped train the NYPD.  We look forward to partnering with maritime training institutions to help offer professional training.*

*If you think your school, academy, or program could use the MARY A. WHALEN in some educational fashion, please get in touch with us at portsidenewyork(at)gmail.com*
