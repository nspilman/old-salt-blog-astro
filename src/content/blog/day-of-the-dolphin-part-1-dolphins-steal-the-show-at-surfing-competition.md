The two posts today present a jarring juxtaposition.  On the West Coast of the United States, dolphins steal the show at a surfing competition while in Japan fishermen are beginning the yearly slaughter of dolphins at Taiji Cove.  The beauty of the first only reinforces the horror of the second.  Tellingly, the dolphins playing in the surf appears to be getting more media coverage than the slaughter.

Over the weekend, a pod of dolphins joined in at a surfing competition in Santa Barabara, California. An estimated dozen or more dolphins rode the waves along with surfers at the [2014 Rincon Classic](http://www.rinconclassic.com/).
