The [Damen shipyard](http://www.damen.ro/) in Galati, Romania recently launched [a new sail training ship for the Royal Navy of Oman.](http://www.damen.com/en/news/2013/05/new-sail-training-vessel-for-royal-navy-of-oman) The three masted steel square masted ship will replace the current Omani sail training ship, [*Shabab Oman*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabab_Oman), a wooden three masted barkentine.  The ship will be rigged and outfitted at Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding in Flushing (the Netherlands). The new ship was designed by [Dykstra Naval Architects](http://www.gdnp.nl/), who also designed the [*Stad Amsterdam*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stad_Amsterdam), [*Cisne Branco*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisne_Branco) and the *[Maltese Falcon](http://www.symaltesefalcon.com/).*

The side launching of the ship set some hearts a flutter on the internet. Several websites, including those which should know better, featured headlines of “*Ship Almost Tips Over During Launch*” or ” *Schooner Nearly Capsizes During Launch.*”  No one should panic, however. That is just what a side launch looks like.  The ship was in no danger.  The engineers got their numbers right.  Everything is fine.  The video below shows the dramatic launch from three different angles.
