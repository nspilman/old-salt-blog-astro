Catamaran Pineapple

Five sailors aboard the catamaran *Pineapple*, which had been reported missing last Tuesday have arrived in the port of Maasin on Leyte Island, in the Philippines after being escorted in by the Philippines Coast Guard.   The 38 foot catamaran suffered rudder damage in heavy seas.

The US Coast Guard which had been searching for the missing boat criticized the crew for failing to have long-range  communications  equipment, emergency distress equipment and for not filing a comprehensive sailing plan.  The 38 foot catamaran suffered rudder damage in heavy seas sailing from Guam to the Philippines.   Reportedly, communications were established when the catamaran drifted withing cell phone range and  a woman on board managed to contact her husband by phone yesterday afternoon. The husband called rescuers in Guam to give the boat’s coordinates.
