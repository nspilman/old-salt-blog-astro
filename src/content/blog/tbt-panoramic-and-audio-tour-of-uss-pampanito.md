On May 24th, [a fire in a warehouse on Pier 45 on San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/05/san-francisco-firefighters-save-liberty-ship-ss-jeremiah-obrien-from-massive-wharf-fire/) came very close to the engulfing the World War II Liberty ship [SS *Jeremiah O’Brien*](https://www.ssjeremiahobrien.org/) and the [USS *Pampanito*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Pampanito_\(SS-383\)), a Balao class fleet submarine museum and memorial from the same era. Fortunately, the timely arrival of San Francisco Fire Boat #3, *St. Francis*, helped to save both historic ships.

On Throwback Thursday here is a repost of a [link to a wonderful panoramic and audio tour](https://maritime.org/tour/index.php) of the [USS](http://www.maritime.org/pamphome.htm) *[Pampanito](http://www.maritime.org/pamphome.htm)*.  By clicking and dragging your mouse across the images you can wander from the main deck to the forward and after torpedo rooms and everywhere in between. The 360-degree panoramic photos are extremely well done. There is text explaining what you are seeing as well as an mp3 audio tour that you can click. According to the [Fact Sheet & Backgrounder](https://maritime.org/pr/factsheet.htm), the sub has its own ice-cream maker. See yesterday’s post, [How Ice Cream Replaced Booze in the US Navy](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/06/how-ice-cream-replaced-booze-in-the-us-navy/).
