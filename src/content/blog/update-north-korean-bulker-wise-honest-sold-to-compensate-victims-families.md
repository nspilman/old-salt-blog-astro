![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wisehonest.jpg)The North Korean handysize bulk carrier [*Wise Honest*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:672235/mmsi:445582000/imo:8905490/vessel:WISE_HONEST) has been sold in a sealed bid auction. The proceeds of the auction will go to compensate the family of Otto Warmbier, the American student who died in 2017 shortly after being released in a vegetative state by North Korea after being tortured for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda poster, as well as the family of the Rev. Dong Shik Kim, who was kidnapped, tortured and executed by North Korean agents in 2000.

The 580-foot, 17,601-ton single-hull bulk carrier was seized in April 2018 by Indonesian authorities for violating international sanctions. [The ship was taken over by the US in May of 2019](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/05/us-takes-control-of-wise-honest-north-koreas-sanctions-violating-bulker-carrier/) and was towed to American Samoa. In July, it was sold under the orders of federal judges in New York and Washington.

How much the families will receive is unclear. In a statement, the US Marshals said that they “do not disclose winning bid amounts or the identity of buyers in our sealed bid auctions.”

The [Samoa News](http://www.samoanews.com/local-news/wise-honest-sold-scrap-metal-departs-american-samoa) reports that the 30-year-old bulker was sold for scrap. The [Navy Times](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/10/09/seized-north-korean-cargo-ship-sold-to-compensate-parents-of-otto-warmbier-others/) estimates that the scrap value of the ship might be at most $1.7 million before the cost of towing and other expenses.
