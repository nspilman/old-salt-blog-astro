![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/queenmary.jpg)The operator of the ex-Cunard [Queen Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Queen_Mary#cite_note-Kelly_Puente-62) has filed for bankruptcy raising concerns about the future of the converted luxury liner that has served as a tourist attraction and hotel in Long Beach, CA since 1972. The converted ship is owned by the City of Long Beach and has been managed by [Eagle Hospitality](https://eagleht.com/), ex-Urban Commons, since 2016.

The [Long Beach Post](https://lbpost.com/news/breaking-queen-mary-operator-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy) notes that this isn’t the first time a *Queen Mary* operator has filed for bankruptcy. A series of companies have failed to make the century-old ocean liner and its surrounding area profitable since it arrived in Long Beach in 1967.

The Eagle Hospitality bankruptcy extends well beyond the *Queen Mary*, however. More than two dozen hotels and other properties, including the *Queen Mary*, listed as entities under Singapore-based Eagle Hospitality Trust filed for bankruptcy on Monday in Delaware court with a total of more than $500 million debt, according to court records obtained by the Post.

The filing comes as Eagle Hospitality has seen major financial problems since it halted trading on Singapore Stock Exchange in 2019 following a notice of default on a $341 million loan from Bank of America.

There are serious concerns about the condition of the converted ship. In August 2019, Edward Pribonic, the engineer responsible for inspecting *Queen Mary* on behalf of the City of Long Beach, issued [a report stating that the ship was in the worst condition he had seen](https://lbpost.com/news/engineer-tasked-with-queen-mary-inspections-says-ship-could-soon-be-unsalvageable-city-disagrees) in his 25 years on the job. Pribonic stated that the neglect of *Queen Mary* had grown worse under the management of Urban Commons, and concluded that “without an immediate and very significant infusion of manpower and money, the condition of the ship will likely soon be unsalvageable.”

The Queen Mary has been closed to the public since May 7 due to the pandemic.
