Singapore has become one of the first states to prioritize seafarers to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. [Nautilus International](https://www.nautilusint.org/en/news-insight/news/singapore-prioritises-seafarers-for-covid-vaccine/) reports that more than 10,000 maritime workers are scheduled for vaccination by the end of January 2021 under the country’s Sea – Air Vaccination Exercise, including port workers, harbor pilots, cargo officers, marine surveyors, and marine superintendents who are required to work onboard ships.

In December, Nautilus International; the UK Chamber of Shipping (UKCS); and the National Union of Rail, Maritime, and Transport Workers (RMT) [put joint pressure on the UK government](https://www.nautilusint.org/en/news-insight/news/seafarers-must-be-a-priority-for-covid-vaccine-say-maritime-organisations/) to treat seafarers as a priority group for vaccination against Covid-19.

The UN General Assembly then followed the UK Government’s lead and called on all governments to designate seafarers as key workers.  [IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim welcomed the UN resolution](https://www.marinelog.com/shipping/imo-secretary-general-urges-priority-covid-19-vaccination-for-seafarers/) and urged that seafarers and maritime workers receive priority COVID-19 vaccination to allow them to work and maintain vital global supply chains.

Last week, over 300 world-leading companies signed the [Neptune Declaration on Seafarer Wellbeing and Crew Change](https://www.intermanager.org/2021/01/global-industry-and-human-rights-leaders-join-forces-to-resolve-humanitarian-crisis-on-the-worlds-oceans/), seeking a worldwide call to action to end the unprecedented crew change crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The Declaration defines four main actions to facilitate crew changes and keep global supply chains functioning: recognizing seafarers as key workers and giving them access to COVID-19 vaccines; establishing and implementing a gold standard health protocol based on existing best practices; increasing collaboration between ship operators and charterers to facilitate crew changes; and ensuring air connectivity between key maritime hubs for seafarers.

It remains to be seen how many nations will follow Singapore’s example.
