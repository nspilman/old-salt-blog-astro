It is also on [sale for the rest of the month.](http://www.gamersdailynews.com/story-19545-Salvo-and-Weird-Worlds-on-Sale-in-September.html) There is even a free [demo](http://www.shrapnelgames.com/SprueGames/SVO/SVO_page.html).

[Salvo! on Sale in September](http://www.gamersdailynews.com/story-19545-Salvo-and-Weird-Worlds-on-Sale-in-September.html)

*[Salvo!](http://www.shrapnelgames.com/SprueGames/SVO/SVO_page.html) is a turn based wargame covering naval warfare from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries. Players can command a wide variety of ship types and do battle amongst all the major seafaring powers of the eras along with treacherous pirate scum. Campaign and scenario based, Salvo! also supports a thorough suite of editing tools that allow gamers to modify/create ships and scenarios. Additionally, players can do battle against live opponents even cross platform (PC versus Mac gamers).*  
  
*Salvo! is very comprehensive and detailed but easy to play. An action marker system allows games to range from ship on ship duels to huge fleet engagements, yet no matter the size of battle the system keeps everything controllable. Visuals are full 3D and in fact the UI is designed so players never feel like they have to leave the action.*

*Fighting Sail fans will appreciate all the work that Spruegames put into Salvo!. Everything you’d want in a Fighting Sail game can be found, from the dangers of shallow water to shore batteries to boarding actions and more.*

*Jim Cobb said of Salvo!, “Every serious student of the Age of Sail needs this game.” Pat Miller of Applelinks remarked, “…for the turn-based tacticians out there who love to obsess about this kind of stuff, Salvo! is definitely the game for you.”*

*Salvo! is available for both Windows and Mac systems as either a physical product or a download. The sale price for September is only $34.95.*
