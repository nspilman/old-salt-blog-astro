Princess Fiona (in green)

In the beginning of November we [posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/07/virtual-port-holes-on-the-disney-dream/) about the new Disney cruise ship, *[Disney Dream](http://disneycruise.disney.go.com/ships-activities/ships/dream/),* where interior cabins will have [virtual port holes](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/07/virtual-port-holes-on-the-disney-dream/), which will show the view outside the ship and will include composited Disney cartoon characters flying by as well.   Now Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines has taken the cartoon on cruise ship a step further as when they had a cartoon character, Princess Fiona from the animated movie, [Shrek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_\(film_series\)), christen their new ship, *[Allure of the Seas](http://www.allureoftheseas.com/video.php?ship=allure)*.   [RCCL has new joint venture agreement  with DreamWorks Animation](http://www.royalcaribbean.com/contentSitelet.do?pagename=dreamworks_main) which produced the movie Shrek among other major animated movies.

The *Allure of the Seas* is the sister ship to the *Oasis of the Seas.* Both ships have can carry 5,400 passengers, double occupancy, and are the largest cruise ships afloat.   *Allure of the Seas* is reportedly a few inches longer than the *Oasis of the Seas* so that RCCL can market the newer ship as the new “largest” cruise ship.
