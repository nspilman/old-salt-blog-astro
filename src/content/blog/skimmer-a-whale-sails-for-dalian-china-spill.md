![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/awhaleskimmer.jpg)[Lloyds List](http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/sector/tankers/article341210.ece?src=Search) is reporting that the [Skimmer “*A Whale*”](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/17/skimmer-a-whale-fails-second-round-of-testing/) which failed to collect significant amounts of oil in the Gulf of mexico from the BP spill is now en-route to the [major spill in Dalian, China](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/21/china-oil-spill-a-severe-threat/).  The more concentrated oil on the water at Dailin may be better suited to the converted OBO’s skimming capabilities.  Thanks to Michael Pryce on the [Marine History List](Marine History List ) for the reference.
