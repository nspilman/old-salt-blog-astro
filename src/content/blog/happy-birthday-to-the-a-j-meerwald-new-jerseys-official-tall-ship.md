I see from the *[A.J. Meerwald](http://bayshorecenter.org/a-j-meerwald/)*‘s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/aj.meerwald?hc_location=reminder_birthday) that today is her birthday. Launched in 1928, she is 85 years old today.  The *A. J. Meerwald* is a restored Delaware Bay oyster schooner and the Official Tall Ship of the State of New Jersey. And a lovely lady she is, indeed.  She was restored by the by the [Bayshore Discovery Project](http://bayshorecenter.org/) and is used for onboard educational programs in the Delaware Bay near Bivalve, and at other ports in the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware region. The *A.J. Meerwald* was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1995.  Here is a short video I shot of a sail on the *A.J. Meerwald* in New York harbor, four years ago.
