![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/08/dojseal.jpg)Lieutenant Randolph M. Prince, known as “Kaz,” had a pretty slick arrangement. “Kaz” was a supply officer in Virginia Beach, VA. Through friends, he set up sham companies which would be awarded government contracts by Prince. He would generate all the necessary paperwork and certify that contracts had been completed. Then Prince and his associates would share the money when the sham companies were paid by the government. 

Or at least it was a slick arrangement while it lasted. On Monday, the [US Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of Virginia announced](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/release-victim-notification) that Randolph M. [Prince pleaded guilty](https://www.scribd.com/document/385595001/Criminal-Information-Submitted-Against-Randolph-Prince#from_embed) to his role in defrauding the government of $2.7 million and to lying on his federal income tax return.  He is scheduled to be sentenced on December 3rd and faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.
