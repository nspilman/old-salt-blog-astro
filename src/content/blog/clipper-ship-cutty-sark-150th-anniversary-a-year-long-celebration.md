![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cuttysark.jpg)In February 1869, one hundred and fifty years ago, construction of the composite clipper ship [*Cutty Sark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark) began on the banks of the River Clyde for the Jock Willis Shipping Line. The clipper ship sailed on its first voyage a year later in February 1870.

The *Cutty Sark* was one of the last tea clippers to be built, was one of the fastest and, perhaps most remarkably, is one of only two clipper ships to survive today. Now fully restored in a drydock in Greenwich, UK, the historic tea clipper is the centerpiece of a year-long celebration of its 150th anniversary.

[Hannah Stockton,](https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/the-cutty-sark-launches-its-150th-anniversary-celebrations/) [curator](https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/the-cutty-sark-launches-its-150th-anniversary-celebrations/) [of the *Cutty Sark*, said](https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/the-cutty-sark-launches-its-150th-anniversary-celebrations/): “It is very exciting to be celebrating *Cutty Sark*’s 150th anniversary, a ship which was only built to last 30 years.

“*Cutty Sark* has survived storms, a broken rudder, a dismasting and, more recently, a fire which, due to a conservation project, was less destructive than it might have been.

“*Cutty Sark* is a survivor, and throughout the year we are inviting visitors to celebrate with us at a range of events; from an anniversary concert, to a family carnival weekend, a 150th-anniversary challenge and much more. It is a historic time to visit the ship.”
