![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/12/mistral-class.jpg)For the last five years we have followed the construction of two Mistral-class amphibious assault ships which were built in France under contract to Russia. If the wind named Mistral is said to “[drive men and horses mad](http://www.frenchpropertylinks.com/essential/winds-france.html),” these ships may be a nautical analogue. When they were ordered by the Russians in 2010, France’s NATO allies were openly critical fo providing the ships to Russia. As reportd by the Economist: *The Mistral is a mighty, 199-metre-long vessel that carries tanks and helicopters, and can conduct and manage amphibious landings. Kaarel Kaas, of the International Centre for Defence Studies, a think-tank in Tallinn, says that such ships would “transform the power balance” on Russia’s borders.*

Following Russia’s annexation Crimea and support of separatists in the Ukraine, France refused to deliver the ships to ships to Russia. [After tense negotiations, the French refunded $1 billion to the Russians.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/09/23/egypt-to-buy-french-mistral-landing-ships-originally-intended-for-russia/) Now the two ships have been sold to Egypt, with “significant” financing from Saudi Arabia, for [950 million euro ($US 1.06 billion.)](http://english.aawsat.com/2015/09/article55345204/france-egypt-agree-950-mln-euro-mistral-warship-deal)

This is not the first or largest military purchase from France by the current Egyptian government. last year, Egypt purchased four small Gowind warships, built by Mistral manufacturer DCNS.  It also acquired a French frigate as part of a 5.2 billion euro contract for 24 Rafale warplanes earlier this year, France’s first overseas export of the fighter jet.
