![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/04/BoatRace-1.jpg)Sometime late Friday night or early Saturdaymorning, near the Coronado Islands, during the 125-mile Newport-to-Ensenada yacht race, something went terribly wrong on the 37′ yacht *Aegean*, leaving three sailors dead and one missing.  A statement issued this morning by the [Newport Ocean Sailing Association](http://www.nosa.org/), which hosts the race, said,  “*An investigation was continuing, but it appeared the damage was not inflicted by an explosion but by a collision with a ship much larger than the 37-foot vessel*.”

This is the second ocean racing tragedy in California in the last two weeks.  On April 14, [five of eight sailors died when their yacht, Slow Speed Chase,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/15/sailors-missing-one-dead-in-full-crew-farallones-race-off-san-fransciso/) was struck by large waves and ran aground on the [Farallon Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Islands) off San Francisco, CA while competing in the Full Crew Farallones Race.

*Three crew members of a sailboat were found dead and a search was under way early Sunday for a fourth, in the state’s second ocean racing tragedy this month.* 

*Coast Guard boats and two aircraft as well as Mexican navy and civilian vessels were searching for the missing crew member.* 

*Other yachts near the Coronado Islands in Mexico reported seeing debris Saturday morning. Searchers in the afternoon found the bodies and debris from the Aegean, whose home port is Redondo Beach, Coast Guard Petty Officer Henry Dunphy said* 

*Two of the dead were recovered by a civilian boat, while the third was found by a Coast Guard helicopter.* 

*The Coast Guard said earlier that it hadn’t determined what happened to the sailboat.*

*Dunphy said conditions were fine for sailing, with good visibility and moderate ocean swells of 6 to 8 feet.* 

*A total of 210 boats were registered in the 65th annual yacht race, according to the Newport Ocean Sailing Assn.’s website. It wasn’t immediately clear how many finished.*
