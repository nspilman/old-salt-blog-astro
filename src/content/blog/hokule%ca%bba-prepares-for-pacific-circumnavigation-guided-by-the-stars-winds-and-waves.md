![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hokulea.jpg)In June 2016, I had the pleasure of visiting *Hōkūleʻa*, a Polynesian double-hulled voyaging canoe, [when she sailed into New York harbor](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/06/hokule%ca%bba-in-north-cove-palm-trees-and-stormy-skies/) in the third year of an epic voyage. Since her launch in 1975, [*Hōkūleʻa*](https://www.hokulea.com/voyages/our-story/), had crisscrossed the Pacific using exclusively traditional navigation techniques. In May of 2014, *Hōkūle‘a* and its sister vessel, *Hikianalia* embarked from Oahu for “[Malama Honua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dk%C5%ABle%CA%BBa#Malama_Honua_\(worldwide_voyage\)_\(2014%E2%80%932017\)),” a three-year circumnavigation of the earth. It returned to port in Hawaii in June 2017. The journey covered 47,000 nautical miles with stops at 85 ports in 26 countries.   

Now, *Hōkūleʻa* and her crew are preparing for an epic circumnavigation of the Pacific beginning this summer. The voyage — [Moananuiākea: A Voyage for Oceans, A Voyage for Earth, 2023 to 2027](https://www.hokulea.com/moananuiakea-voyage/) will be Hōkūleʻa’s 15th major voyage in her first 50 years.

Moananuiākea will be a 43,000 nautical mile, 47-month circumnavigation of the Pacific by traditional Polynesian voyaging canoes *Hōkūleʻa* and *Hikianalia* and 400 crew to 36 countries and archipelagoes, nearly 100 indigenous territories, and 345 ports.

Starting in June, the expedition will set off from Alaska and eventually end in Tahiti in the spring of 2027. The planned route includes the U.S. West Coast, Mexico, parts of South America, Polynesia, New Zealand or Aotearoa, Micronesia, Japan and more.

The [Polynesian Voyaging Society](https://www.hokulea.com/) explains the purpose of the upcoming voyage:

*To ignite a movement of 10 million “planetary navigators” who will pursue critical and inspiring “voyages” to ensure a better future for the earth. We do so by developing young leaders and engaging communities around the world while amplifying the vital importance of our oceans, nature, science and indigenous wisdom. PVS and Pacific voyaging leadership are identifying important cultural, educational and environmental sites to visit during the Voyage. Each leg will have a specific purpose and lead to our ultimate goal of connecting Pacific communities for collective action around common challenges and a shared sustainable destiny.*
