![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/08/US-CoastGuard.jpg)As the wholly unnecessary and reckless partial government shutdown rolls on, 41,000 active duty US Coast Guard personnel are still doing their jobs, without getting paid. Roughly 8,500 civilian support staff are furloughed, also without paychecks.

Across the country, concerned citizens are trying to find means to help the Coast Gaurd families with everything from gift cards to food banks. Through it all, Coast Guard officers and enlisted personnel are saving lives, intercepting criminals, and generally defending our coasts. Here is an incomplete list of what the US Coast Guard has been up to while not getting a paycheck, as compiled by [Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/01/15/heres-everything-coast-guard-did-without-paycheck-month.html).   

*   **Medevacced ill fisherman** –  Members of U.S. Coast Guard District 14 Hawaii Pacific rescued a 37-year-old man from a tuna longliner about 80 miles north of Kauai on Jan. 13.
*   **Rescued Chinese fishing crew** – In yet another mission for District 14, Coast Guardsmen assisted in the rescue of 24 mariners Jan. 2 from the Ou Ya Leng No. 6, a 308-foot Chinese-flagged fishing vessel that ran aground on Taka Atoll in the Marshall Islands.
*   **Interdicted migrants near Puerto Rico** – In a period of 72 hours, the Coast Guard interdicted 66 migrants who were attempting to illegally enter the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands this month.
*   **Seized illegal drugs** – Crew members of the Coast Guard Sentinel-class cutter Bernard C. Webber made a drug seizure Jan. 7, interdicting a sport fisher boat carrying a suspected smuggler, a pair of migrants, and 7 kilograms of cocaine east of Dania Beach, Florida.
*   **Assisted grounded cargo ship** – When the cargo ship JSW Salem ran aground east of Virginia Beach on Jan. 10, the Coast Guard was on hand to help. 
*   **Resupply Antarctica** – The 150 crewmembers of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star arrived Thursday in Antarctica along with a resupply vessel during Operation Deep Freeze – a joint military service mission to resupply U.S. interests in Antarctica.

In addition to the list compiled by Military.com, here are a few more:

*   [**Rescue of an injured crewman on Great Lakes bulker**](https://www.jsonline.com/story/communities/northshore/news/port-washington/2019/01/10/coast-guard-rescues-crewman-lake-michigan-during-shutdown/2528697002/) – Although their next paycheck is in limbo because of the federal government shutdown, employees of the U.S. Coast Guard jumped into action on Tuesday, Jan. 8, when a man aboard a cargo ship in Lake Michigan was injured.
*   [**Assisted, escorted fishing vessels and responded to capsize in Yakima Bay**](https://www.oregonlive.com/expo/news/g66l-2019/01/977489a9bc5921/coast-guard-rescue-you-hear-this-roaring-and-sucking-sound-coming-right-at-you.html) – This month, Yaquina Bay Coast Guard crews stationed in Newport have assisted five disabled boats, escorted in numerous vessels when seas have turned dangerously rough and risked their own lives trying to save the crew of the Mary B II. 
*   [**Rescue of three from a capsized vessel in Florida**](https://keysnews.com/article/story/u-s-coast-guard-rescues-three-from-capsized-vessel/) – The United States Coast Guard rescued three people approximately six miles south of Sugarloaf Key after their vessel capsized on Wednesday. 
*   **[Apprehend Stowaways on Containership Off Miami](https://gcaptain.com/u-s-coast-guard-cbp-apprehend-stowaways-aboard-containership-off-miami/)** – The U.S. Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection responded to a report of three stowaways found hiding on an Antigua and Barbuda-flagged containership approximately three miles offshore of Port of Miami on Wednesday.

This is by no means a complete list of the important things being done by the US Coast Gaurd while they do not know when their paycheck will arrive. It is time to end the shutdown over a needless vanity wall and to support the brave men and women of the US Coast Guard.
