![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/finwhalesydney.jpg)As if anyone needed a reminder of how vulnerable whales are to ship strikes, when [HMAS *Sydney*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Sydney_\(D48\)) pulled into Naval Base San Diego over the weekend, it brought with it a grim cargo. The carcasses of [two fin whales were dislodged](https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/fin-whale-carcasses-dislodged-from-hmas-sydney-at-us-naval-base/news-story/e07ab72aceec88eabbe0089e5117e964) from beneath the hull of the Royal Australian Navy destroyer. One whale was 20m long while the other was about 8m and are suspected to have been a mother and a calf.

HMAS *Sydney* has been in the area conducting joint exercises with the US Navy since early April.

“The Royal Australian Navy can confirm that as HMAS *Sydney* was berthing alongside Naval Base San Diego in California two deceased whales dislodged from her hull beneath the surface,” the statement said.

“The US Navy and the Royal Australian Navy are co-operating with the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Fisheries and other agencies to review the incident.

“The Navy takes marine mammal safety seriously and is disheartened this incident occurred.”
