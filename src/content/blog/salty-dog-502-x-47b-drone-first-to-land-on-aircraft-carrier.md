A [US Navy’s X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/specifications-of-the-x-47-drone/2013/07/10/93bba06e-e9a6-11e2-a301-ea5a8116d211_graphic.html) drone, nicknamed Salty Dog 502, successfully landed on the deck of the aircraft carrier [USS *George HW Bush*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_George_H.W._Bush_\(CVN-77\)) at sea.  The [Navy press release](http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=75298) reads, in part: “Today’s demonstration was the first time a tailless, unmanned autonomous aircraft landed on a modern aircraft carrier…”   The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/navy-lands-drone-aboard-aircraft-carrier-for-first-time/2013/07/10/b8e468c0-e99d-11e2-9204-f3221bd550e3_story.html) commented on the ability of the drone to operate independently of remote pilot control:  *While the X-47B still followed a flight path scripted by personnel on the ground, it executed the landing entirely on its own, calculating by itself how fast to approach the ship and precisely when to put its wheels down.*   Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) and Irwin Bryan for passing along the news.
