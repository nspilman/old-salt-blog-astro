Recent studies by researchers at Penn State have suggested that Northern Right Whales increase the volumes of their calls to counteract increases in environmental noise, such as propeller noise from ships.  This is the first time that an ability to modulate call volume to adjust to environmental noise has been documented  in baleen whales.
