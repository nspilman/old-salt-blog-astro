Tom Russell over at the [Tall Ship & Traditional Sail Professionals Linked-In](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=2041742) [group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=2041742) pointed out the [Tall Ships Tracking Map](http://www.sailwx.info/shiptrack/tallships.phtml) posted on-line by [Sailwx.info](http://www.sailwx.info/index.html).   [Sailwx.info](http://www.sailwx.info/index.html) is a wonderful site for keeping track of of all sort of ships, including tall ships.  They also have a separate tracking page dedicated to the [ASTA Great Lakes United Tall Ships Challenge® 2010](http://www.sailwx.info/shiptrack/tsc2010.phtml) which includes nice thumbnail photos and ships’  information.

The site has pages for cruise ships, oceanographic research vessels,  yachts as well as weather, wind and tide information for ports around the world.  There is also a twitter feed from reporting ships and the ability to search for ships by name.  A really fun site, but be warned –  it is an easy site to spend a lot of time on.
