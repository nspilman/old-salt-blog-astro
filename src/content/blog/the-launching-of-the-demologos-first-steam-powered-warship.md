![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fultondemologos.jpg)On October 29, 1815, 205 years ago yesterday, the [*Demologos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_floating_battery_Demologos), the first steam-powered warship, was launched from [Adam and Noah Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Noah_Brown)‘s shipyard on New York’s East River. It was a steam-powered floating battery designed by steamboat pioneer [Robert Fulton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fulton) to be used to protect New York harbor from the British during the War of 1812. After sea trials, the battery was delivered to the United States Navy in June, 1816. 

The design of the vessel featured a catamaran hull with a single centerline midship paddlewheel capable of propelling the battery at five knots, under good conditions. Originally designed to mount thirty 32-pounder guns, later drawings show eighteen. She was also intended to carry two 100-pounder Columbiads, which were never installed.

While the design was innovative, the timing was poor. Robert Fulton died the previous February of 1815, at the age of 49. Also during the same month, a peace treaty was signed, ending the War of 1812. 

The ship was renamed the *Fulton* by the Navy, in honor of its inventor.  The only day of active service the ship saw was when she carried President James Monroe on a tour of New York Harbor.

A two-masted lateen rig was added by the orders of her first commander, Captain David Porter. In 1821 her armament and machinery were removed. The remainder of her career was spent laid up in reserve; after 1825 she served as a receiving ship, a floating barracks, for Brooklyn Navy Yard. She came to an end on June 4, 1829, in a gunpowder explosion while lying at anchor, killing an officer and 47 men.
