![zora-neale-hurstons-123rd-birthday-5830801295933440-hp](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/zora-neale-hurstons-123rd-birthday-5830801295933440-hp.jpg)Today is the 123rd anniversary of [Zora Neale Hurston](http://zoranealehurston.com/books/)‘s birthday. She is being honored by Google with a graphic on the main search page. Hurston is considered to be one of the pre-eminent African-America writers of the 20th century. She did not really write about ships or the sea. Nevertheless, the opening lines from her best known novel, *Their Eyes Were Watching God* is a favorite of mine.

*Ships at a distance have every man’s wish on board. For some they come in with the tide. For others they sail forever on the horizon, never out of sight, never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time.*
