![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ssus2.jpg)Great news from the [SS United States Conservancy](http://ssusc.org/).  At the beginning of October, the  [Conservancy announced](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/11/temporary-reprieve-for-ss-united-states/) that its board had retained the services of a broker to explore selling the [SS *United States*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States) for scrap “*over concerns about the organization’s long-term ability to continue financing the upkeep of the ship in the absence of firm redevelopment commitments and capital*.”  Since then the Conservancy has raised sufficient funds to keep the ship afloat well into next year. From the [Conservancy press release](http://www.ssusc.org/nov-24-2015-rallying-around-our-flagship-ss-united-states-receives-major-donations-conservancy-board-rejects-scrap-bids/):

*Thanks to several major donations, as well as additional contributions from more than 800 supporters, the Conservancy’s Board of Directors voted late Monday not to accept any of the three bids submitted by the recyclers. The Conservancy has now raised well over $600,000 since it issued last month’s SOS, including two $100,000 gifts and a $250,000 donation.* 

*The Conservancy’s board was also encouraged by recent progress on the redevelopment front.“People from the world over have sent a loud and clear message that the SS United States must not be destroyed,” stated Susan Gibbs, the Conservancy’s Executive Director. “From a 6th grader named Thomas in Florida who sent in a $5 bill along with a wonderful drawing of the ship in red, white, and blue magic marker, to our three extraordinary leadership donors, the outpouring of support has been incredibly encouraging.The SS United States has been given a temporary lifeline, and we are now powerfully positioned to advance our shared goal of saving America’s Flagship for future generations.”*

*As a result of the campaign, which was covered in hundreds of media outlets in dozens of countries, the Conservancy’s ongoing redevelopment negotiations have also gained new momentum. Prior to October’s SOS campaign launch, the Conservancy had already identified two potential locations that could accommodate the vessel, and new investor interest in recent weeks has introduced new possibilities and programming concepts for the historic liner. “Several qualified partners have recently made site visits with their engineers, architects and executives,” said Gibbs.”The possibilities for the SS United States’ revitalization are truly exciting.”*

At the end of October, [we posted about one of the potential berths](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/10/a-new-home-in-red-hook-brooklyn-for-the-ss-united-states/) for the historic ship. [John Quadrozzi Jr](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.605186586182979.1073741875.445992685435704&type=1)., owner of the GBX-Gowanus Bay Terminal in the South Red Hook section of Brooklyn, has offered a rent-free berth at his facility to the SS *United States.*  If the ship does move to Red Hook it will be very close to its original berth on the Hudson River.
