The [ROV Hercules,](https://nautiluslive.org/tech/rov-hercules) operated by the E/V Nautilus, a research vessel owned by the [nonprofit Ocean Exploration Trust](https://nautiluslive.org/about), has captured video of a [rare dumbo octopus](https://nautiluslive.org/video/2023/09/27/cute-dumbo-octopus-eyes-rov-hercules) at a depth of over 1,600 meters deep.  The research vessel was exploring the Woollard Seamount in the [Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/08/obama-expands-papahanaumokuakea-largest-marine-sanctuary-longest-name/) in the North Pacific. 

The octopus is named dumbo because it resembles the title character of the [1941 Disney film](https://youtu.be/tLtQ3bCvBA0?si=dgSI13t-7SnVwPmF), using its ear-like fins to swim. Dumbo octopuses are the deepest living octopuses known and have an average life span of three to five years. They do not have an ink sack, unlike other cephalopods, and lack the ability to change color.
