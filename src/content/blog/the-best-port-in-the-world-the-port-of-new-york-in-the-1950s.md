Here is a wonderful video from the 1950s focusing on the Port of New York, which the narrator proclaims is the “Best Port in the World.” It is wonderful to watch the old style cargo handling — hoisting bags, boxes, and barrels as the narration praises the modern technology and extreme efficiency. What I find intriguing is how little seemed to have changed by the early 1970s, when I first arrived in New York, right on the cusp of the great container revolution, which changed everything.

The film was written by Oeveste Granducci. The film was directed by Henwar Rodakiewicz and shot by David Quaid, with music by King Palmer.
