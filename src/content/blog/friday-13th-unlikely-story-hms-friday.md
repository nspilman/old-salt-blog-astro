![f13](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/f13.jpg)Sailors have long considered Friday to be an unlucky day and Friday the 13th, particularly so. On this Friday the 13th, it seems appropriate to remember the unlikely tale of [HMS *Friday*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Friday).

Sometime in the 1800s, it is said that the Royal Navy decided to dispel the stigma attached to Friday. They commissioned a ship and named it the HMS *Friday*. Her keel was laid on a Friday, she was launched on a Friday, and she set sail on her maiden voyage on Friday the 13th, under the command of a Captain James Friday. She was never seen or heard from again.

While this is an oft-told tale, none of it is true. There has never been a Royal Navy ship named *Friday*, or any other day of the week, for that matter. HMS *Ark Royal*, on the other hand, [was relaunched on Friday, June 13, 2001](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/1409082.stm), following a major overhaul and continued successfully for another decade before she was decommissioned in 2011.  Happy Friday the 13th.
