Fifteen years ago, a group of sea shanty enthusiasts got together for an old fashioned shanty sing. Their first meeting was, fittingly enough on the windjammer [*Peking*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_\(ship\)) at South Street Seaport. For many years they met monthly at the Seaman’s Church Institute near South Street, until the church sold the building and moved out of Manhattan. Since May the group has been hosted by the [Noble Maritime Collection at Snug Harbor](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/05/12/the-william-main-doerflinger-memorial-sea-shanty-sessions-at-the-noble-maritime-collection-at-snug-harbor/) in Staten Island. [Snug Harbor](http://www.snug-harbor.org/) was once a destitute sailor’s retirement home. The shanty sessions are dedicated to the memory of [William Main Doerflinger](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NVDVUW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B000NVDVUW) who “collected” many of the old shanties from retired sailors at Snug Harbor. Last Sunday the shanty singers got together again. Here is a short video I shot of the session.
