On May 9, 1941, seventy years ago today, the [German submarines U110 and U201](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-110_\(1940\)) were attacking a British convoy in the Atlantic south of Iceland.   U110 was forced to surface after being depth changed and was abandoned by her crew who thought that the submarine was sinking.  A boarding party from HMS *Bulldog* boarded the submarine and carried off its code books, ciphers and a Naval Enigma machine.   The Enigma machine and the documents allowed Alan Turing and his codebreakers at Bletchley Park to break the German Naval Enigma code, an  intelligence breakthrough which changed the course of the war in the Atlantic.

An [exhibit commemorating the 70th anniversary of the capture of an Enigma machine and codebooks from a German wartime submarine has opened in Bletchley Park](http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/644156).

[Bletchley Park opens U-110 Enigma exhibit](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/09/enigma_exhibit_bletchley_park/)  
  
*The exhibition contains photographs of the capture of the secret coding device of the U-boat 110 on 9 May 1941, as well as the first-hand account of the 20-year-old sub lieutenant who climbed into the U-boat to seize the documents and the factual material, providing a background to the story. Mercifully the much-derided Hollywood version of the story, U-571 – which featured Americans and not Brits capturing the device – doesn’t get a look-in.*

*The exhibit also covers the story from the German side, with testimony from some of the U-boat survivors. Historian Hugh Sebag-Montefiore has added background material to provide context to the display.*

*The capture of the U-110 was crucial in breaking the naval Enigma code. Alan Turing and his Bletchley Park codebreakers were not at first able to break the naval Enigma code used by Germany’s U-boats, but the capture of codebooks from U-110 provided vital clues that helped crack the code.*
