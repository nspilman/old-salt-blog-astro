Here is a wonderful short video by Ryan Smith featuring some really breathtaking drone footage of the rebuilding and rerigging of the Tall Ship [*Providence*](https://www.visitalexandriava.com/listings/tall-ship-providence/8640/). The 1976 built replica of the [Continental Navy sloop of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Providence_\(1775\)), was blown off her jack stands while on shore in Newport, Rhode Island during a [blizzard in 2015.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/01/tall-ship-providence-blown-over-in-blizzard-winds/)  This summer, her restoration was completed and she was rerigged in Wiscasset, Maine. *Providence* is now on her way to her new home in Alexandria, VA.
