The combination of a peak high tide, excavation by dredgers, and the combined pull of more than a dozen tugs has finally freed the ultra-large container ship [*Ever Given*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:5630138/mmsi:353136000/imo:9811000/vessel:EVER_GIVEN).  The 400-meter long container ship carrying 18,000 containers [ran aground last Tuesday blocking the Suez Canal](http://oldsaltblog.com/2021/03/suez-canal-still-blocked-by-ultra-large-container-ship-ever-given/) and resulting in a traffic jam of roughly 400 ships. The shutting down of the canal cost an estimated $10 billion per day in lost commerce.

The ship will be [towed toward the Great Bitter Lake](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2021/03/29/cargo-ship-ever-given-partially-refloated-suez-canal-blocked/7043031002/), a wide stretch of water in the middle of the canal, where the ship will undergo technical inspection, canal authorities said.
