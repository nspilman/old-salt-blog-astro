![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/06/cruise_jpg_651953f.jpg)Earlier this week, Union Shipping Minister G K Vasan officiated at a gathering on board the MV *[AMET Majesty](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.131029753642080.31202.131005830311139)*, India’s first cruise liner.   The ship is also a training ship.  The acronym AMET  stands for “Academy of Maritime Education and Training.”  [AMET University](http://www.ametuniv.ac.in/) is operating the ship as both a [cruise ship](http://ametcruises.com/index.htm) for 1,150 passengers and a training ship for 90 nautical cadets and 120 engineering cadets.   How this hybrid operation will function remains to be seen, but one has to admire the evident enthusiasm. The [cruise marketing site](http://ametcruises.com/index.htm) promises “*a total royal treat on a seven star category cruise liner*.”    I have never seen a crusie ship rating higher than five stars, so seven stars sounds very impressive.
