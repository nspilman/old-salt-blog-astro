An underwater volcano has creating a new island around 620 miles south of Toyko, Japan.  According to the [Associated Press](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/japan-reports-volcano-raises-island-in-seas-far-south-of-tokyo/2013/11/21/d1613814-526c-11e3-9ee6-2580086d8254_story.html) it is roughly 660 feet in diameter, off the coast of Nishinoshima, a small, uninhabited island in the Ogasawara chain, which is also known as the Bonin Islands. Whether the island will survive erosion by the sea remains to be seen. Thanks to Phil Leon for contributing to the post.
