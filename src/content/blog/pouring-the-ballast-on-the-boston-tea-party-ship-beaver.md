The *[Beaver](http://www.bostonteapartyship.com/boston-tea-party-1773)*, a replica of one of ships that were the center of the [Boston Tea Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party) in the run-up to the American Revolution, was relaunched in January after a major rebuild at the [Gloucester Marine Railways](http://www.gloucestermarinerailways.com/).  The *Beaver* and the replica *Eleanor* will be displayed at the new $27 million  [Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum](http://www.bostonteapartyship.com/) on Fort Point Channel in Boston, which will open in June of this year.  A third ship, the  *Dartmouth*, will be built from scratch, and is expected to be completed in about two years.

Leon Poindexter, the master shipwright leading the project, has been broadcasting a series of Youtube Webisodes. Here is *[Ballast for the Beaver](http://youtu.be/51j6Tsgpgow)*, episode 45, where concrete is being poured in the ship for ballast.   I am not familiar with the use of concrete for ballast in wooden ships.  If anyone is able to enlighten me, I would appreciate it.  Thanks to Tom Russell at the [Traditional Sail Professionals Linked-in Group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=2041742&trk=anet_ug_hm) for pointing it out the video.
