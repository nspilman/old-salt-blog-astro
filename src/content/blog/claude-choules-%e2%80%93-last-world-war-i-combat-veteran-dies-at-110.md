[Last WWI combat veteran Claude Choules dies aged 110](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13289607)

*The world’s last known combat veteran of World War I, Claude Choules, has died in Australia aged 110.*

*Known to his comrades as Chuckles, British-born Mr Choules joined the Royal Navy at 15 and went on to serve on HMS Revenge.*  
  
*He moved to Australia in the 1920s and served in the military until 1956.*

*Mr Choules, who had been married to his wife Ethel for 76 years, was reported to have died in his sleep at a nursing home in his adopted city of Perth.  He is survived by three children and 11 grandchildren. His wife died three years ago.*

*Mr Choules’ 84-year-old daughter, Daphne Edinger, told the Associated Press news agency: “We all loved him. It’s going to be sad to think of him not being here any longer, but that’s the way things go.”*

*Despite his military record, Mr Choules became a pacifist. He was known to have disagreed with the celebration of Australia’s most important war memorial holiday, Anzac Day, and refused to march in the annual commemoration parades.*

*He took a creative writing course at the age of 80 and recorded his memoirs for his family. They formed the basis of the autobiography, [The Last of the Last](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845966317/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1845966317), which was published in 2009.*

*The last three WWI veterans living in Britain – Bill Stone, Henry Allingham and Harry Patch – all died in 2009.*

*Another Briton, Florence Green – who turned 110 in February and was a waitress in the Women’s Royal Air Force – is now thought to be the world’s last known surviving service member of WWI. An American veteran, Frank Buckles, died earlier this year.*
