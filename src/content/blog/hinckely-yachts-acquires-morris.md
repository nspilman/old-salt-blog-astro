[![morris](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/morris.jpg)Hinckley Yachts announced that it has acquired Morris Yachts.](http://www.cruisingworld.com/new-chapter-for-morris-yachts?src=SOC&dom=fb) Both are high-end boat builders and the boatyards are within a quarter mile of each other in Trenton, Maine. Hinckley says it plans to continue the Morris boatbuilding and service operations under the Morris Yachts name.

Both [Hinckley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinckley_Yachts) and [Morris](http://morrisyachts.com/) began as family boatbuilding operations. Hinckley was founded in 1928 by Benjamin B. Hinckley and Morris was founded by Tom Morris in 1972. In 1977, Hinckley Yachts was acquired by the private equity firm, Bain Williard Companies. Four years later is was sold again to another private equity firm Monitor Clipper Partners. In 2010, Hinckley was sold again to [Scout Partners](http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=117919166).

Tom Morris, the founder of Morris Yachts, died in 2008. His death coincided with the major recession of that year. In recent years, [the firm has been struggling with slow sales and has hinted that they were interested in speaking to potential investors](http://bangordailynews.com/2015/10/26/business/morris-yachts-getting-back-on-track-after-recession-doldrums/) or partners. The acquisition by Hinckley effectively broadens Scout Partner’s portfolio of high-end yacht builders. In addition to acquiring Hinckley, [Scout acquired Hunt Yachts](http://www.tradeonlytoday.com/2013/09/hinckley-parent-company-acquires-hunt-yachts/), a builder of luxury powerboats in 2013.
