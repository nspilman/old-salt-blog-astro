![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mtug1.jpg)The ongoing cleanup following the fuel oil spill from the grounded bulk carrier *Wakashio* off Mauritius turned deadly when a [tug assisting in the effort sank after colliding with an oil barge](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishandegnarain/2020/09/01/satellite-analysis-reveals-drama-of-mauritius-tug-boat-and-oil-barge-sinking-overnight/?ss=manufacturing#29d0f6011579). The tug *Sir Gaetan Duval* had a crew of 8. Four of the crew were rescued, 3 died, and 1 is still missing. 

There are conflicting reports about the barge status and condition, but it now appears that the barge was empty and remained afloat following the collision. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishandegnarain/2020/08/31/fear-of-second-major-oil-spill-in-mauritius-as-oil-barge-overturns/#73e17e47085b) reports that video taken by local fishermen on 1 September morning revealed the oil barge drifting unattached along the coast of Mauritius. There was no satellite anti-collision tracking transponder on the oil barge.

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/tug-responding-to-mauritius-oil-spill-sinks-3-sailors-dead/2020/09/01/f2452ac6-ec71-11ea-bd08-1b10132b458f_story.html) reports that the tug was towing the empty barge from the stranded stern section of the Japanese ship, the MV *Wakashio*, on Monday night when heavy seas rammed the barge into the tug. It sank off the northeast coast of the Indian Ocean island nation, near a village called Poudre D’or. The tugboat sank in deep water outside a coral reef and so far no oil has been seen on the coast.

The environmental disaster began on July 25 when the bulk carrier *Wakashio* strayed miles off course and struck a coral reef a mile offshore. After being pounded by heavy surf for nearly two weeks, the ship’s hull cracked and on Aug. 6 it began leaking fuel into the Mahebourg Lagoon, polluting a protected wetlands area and a small island that was a bird and wildlife sanctuary.  
More than 1,000 tons of fuel spilled into the coastal waters. About 3,000 tons remained on the boat and was pumped into barges before the *Wakashio* broke in two several days later.

Dead dolphins began washing up on the coast last week. So far 47 dolphins and three whales have been found. An initial autopsy by a government laboratory said oil was not the cause of the deaths, but few Mauritians believe that, an official said.

The government of Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth is under pressure to explain why immediate action was not taken when the ship first ran aground. He has blamed bad weather for the government’s apparent inaction.
