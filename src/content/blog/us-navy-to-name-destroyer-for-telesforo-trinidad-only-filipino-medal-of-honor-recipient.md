![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/05/Trinidad.jpg)U.S. Secretary of the Navy [Carlos Del Toro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Del_Toro) has announced that a future Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer will be named the [USS *Telesforo Trinidad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Telesforo_Trinidad_\(DDG-139\)) in honor of a Filipino sailor who rescued two crew members when their ship caught fire more than a century ago.

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/navy-ship-to-be-named-for-filipino-sailor-telesforo-trinidad/2022/05/19/c45066a8-d7a2-11ec-be17-286164974c54_story.html) reports that Fireman [Telesforo De La Cruz Trinidad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telesforo_Trinidad) is the only Filipino in the US Navy to be awarded the Medal of Honor. He received the honor for his actions on the [USS *San Diego*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_California_\(ACR-6\)) in 1915 and at a time when it could be awarded for non-combat valor.

“Since being sworn in as Secretary, I have wanted to honor his heroic actions by naming a ship after him,” Del Toro said in a statement released Thursday. “This ship and her future crew will be a critical piece in strengthening our maritime superiority while also emphasizing the rich culture and history of our naval heritage.”

During speed and endurance trials on the USS San Diego on January 21, 1915, the ship suffered several boiler explosions. Despite being seriously burned himself, Fireman Trinidad rescued two fellow crew from the burning engine room.

For his bravery, the [Navy awarded Trinidad the Medal of Honor](https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/biographies-list/bios-t/trinidad-telesford.html) and a $100 gratuity. Trinidad survived the ordeal and lived a long life, finally passing away at the age of 77 on May 8, 1968, in Imus, Cavite, Republic of the Philippines.
