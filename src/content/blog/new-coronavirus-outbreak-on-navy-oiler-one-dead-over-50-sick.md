![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/grumman.jpg)The latest coronavirus outbreak on a Navy ship is on the Military Sealift Command’s (MSC) fleet replenishment oiler, [USNS *Leroy Grumman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Leroy_Grumman_\(T-AO-195\)). The [Project On Government Oversight (POGO)](https://www.pogo.org/investigation/2020/05/52-infected-after-navy-fails-to-prevent-virus-spread-on-ship/) is reporting that the outbreak occurred late last month, barely a week after the MSC assured the public that the coronavirus was not spreading among civilian mariners.

Twenty-two of the 46 civilian crew members and 30 government contractors have tested positive for the coronavirus. One contractor has been reported to have died from COVID-19 while one merchant mariner has been hospitalized in critical condition. 

[Representatives of the mariner’s union and some lawmakers are raising concerns](https://www.wtkr.com/civilian-mariners-stuck-on-ships-as-lawmakers-ask-questions-about-how-the-situation-is-being-handled) that failures in MSC “up gangway” policy made the outbreak more likely. MSC’s “up gangway” order has prevented members of the ship’s crew from leaving MSC ships unless replaced. Mariners told POGO that even as they were confined to their ships, the order inexplicably allowed contractors and other personnel to move on and off the ships, piercing the ships’ quarantine “bubble.” 

The outbreak on the *Grumman*, docked at a shipyard in Boston, spread through the crew and to contractors in a matter of days. The entire crew has been isolated in a hotel in Boston since May 2. The House Armed Services Committee has opened an inquiry into circumstances surrounding the outbreak.  

In related news, the [aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/aircraft-carrier-uss-theodore-roosevelt-returns-sea-after-coronavirus-outbreak-n1211716), which has been tied up in Guam for the last two months with a coronavirus outbreak, has sailed. The Navy said that the aircraft carrier entered the Philippine Sea on Thursday “to conduct carrier qualification flights for Carrier Air Wing 11.”
