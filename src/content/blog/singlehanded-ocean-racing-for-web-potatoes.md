Modern technology has revolutionized single handled ocean racing in so many ways for both sailors and spectators. The five sailors in the [Velux Five Oceans race](http://www.velux5oceans.com/) not only face all the hazards of the sea as they sail singlehanded around the world, but are also blogging, taking photographs and videotaping their exploits to entertain web-potatoes around the world.  (A web-potato is similar to a couch-potato except that a web-potato sits in front of a computer rather than a  television.)  
  
The Velux Five Ocean race organization has done a wonderful job at making a spectator sport of a singlehanded race across vast oceans.  Its [site](http://www.velux5oceans.com/) features a live map to track the five competitors, as well as blog postings, photography and videos. The current race leader, American, Brad Van Liew, racing on Le Pingouin, recently posted a [video of his crossing of the equator](http://www.velux5oceans.com/skipper-news/brad-equator-crossing/).

The race hasn’t lacked for drama. Earlier in the race Brad Van Liew posted a video not long after his boat suffered a crash knockdown.  Likewise, after seriously gashing his face in the blades of a wind generator,  Polish racer, Zbigniew Gutkowski, known as Gutek,  blogged about having to stitch the gashes using a mirror:

*“First I had to clean my wounds and put some stiches. It went well, and I was really surprised. But it was like in a movie, when Terminator is fixing his eye looking at the mirror. But the difference is that the boat is moving and rocking and tossing.”*

As of this morning Brad Van Liew on *Le Pingouin* holds the lead with 3,910 nautical miles to go to the end of the first leg of the race in Cape Town, South Africa.  Gutek on *Operon Racing* is only 78 miles behind, with the rest of the fleet strung out over almost 2,000 miles.
