The “Left Coast Lifter” has [arrived in New York](http://workingharbor.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/supercrane-arrives-tomorrow/).  The Lifter is described by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/nyregion/muscular-west-coast-worker-is-on-way-to-build-new-tappan-zee.html) as the “superman of floating cranes.” It is a shear-leg crane barge capable of lifting over 1,800 tons, built to help lift bridge sections during the replacement of the East Span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in 2009-2010. The barge, nicknamed the “Left Coast Lifter,” has been towed to the right coast, err.. the East Coast to help dismantle the old Tappan Zee bridge over the Hudson River, north of New York City and then help to rebuild the new bridge.
