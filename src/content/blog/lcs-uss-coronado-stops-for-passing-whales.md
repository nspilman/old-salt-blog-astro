![lcswhalewatch](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lcswhalewatch.jpg)Last Sunday was the second of two weekends of the [Dana Point Festival of Whales](http://festivalofwhales.com/), which celebrates the annual migration of gray whales which passes the coastal California community. Captain Todd Mansur of [Dana Wharf  Whale Watching](http://www.danawharf.com/whalewatch.html) was following two gray whales, when he found himself and the whales in a crossing situation with the *[USS Coronado](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Coronado_\(LCS-4\)),* a new Navy Independence-class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).  Captain Mansur was able to contact the Navy ship and alert them to the whales off their bow.  The ship came to a complete stop and let the gray whales and the whale watchers pass.  The LCS is a radical trimaran ship design meant to operate in coastal water and is capable of cruising at 40 knots, with a top speed of 46 knots.  On Sunday, the *USS Coronado* was underway at only around three knots, so it had no trouble stopping to avoid the whales.

![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif)The grays whales were swimming north toward their summer Arctic feeding grounds after wintering in the Baja region of Mexico. The yearly 12,000 mile migration is among the longest of any mammal species.  Ships strikes are one of the leading causes of whale deaths. Fortunately, the close cooperation between whale watchers and the US Navy avoided a potential collision last Sunday.  Thanks to Irwin Bryan for contributing to the post.
