[*l’Hydroptère*](http://hydroptere.com/en/home/), a hydrofoil trimaran, is the [fastest sailing vessel on the water](http://yachtpals.com/hydroptere-sailing-record-7065).   Last November, it sailed at an average speed of  50.17 knots over one nautical mile. *l’**Hydroptère* also holds the speed record of 51.36 knots over 500 meters.

Now the *l’Hydroptère* team is working to develop an ocean going version of the hydrofoil tri with the goal of sailing around the world in 40 days.  The plan is to build two boats, *l’Hydroptère.ch,* a scaled down version of a new design to be used for testing and development*,* followed by the full sized, *l’Hydroptère maxi.*
