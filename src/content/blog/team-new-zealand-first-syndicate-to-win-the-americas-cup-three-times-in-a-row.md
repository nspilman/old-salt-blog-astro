![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/etnz37ac.jpg)Emirates Team New Zealand clinched match point in the [37th America’s Cup](https://apnews.com/article/americas-cup-sailing-barcelona-yachts-auld-mug-46176798558ca5530466b771c9dba1c8) on Saturday, beating INEOS Britannia 7-2 in the best-of-13 finals held just off Barcelona’s beachfront as reported by the [AP](https://apnews.com/article/americas-cup-new-zealand-britain-sailing-0783a5a254f38fe1d6d98fdde490c489).

The [team led by Grant Dalton](https://apnews.com/article/americas-cup-grant-dalton-new-zealand-sailing-2d2f767c7689057fd6a41b96ee0fa1b6) won its third consecutive cup, adding to wins in 2017 in Bermuda and 2021 in Auckland. That made Team New Zealand the first syndicate to win the America’s Cup three times in a row.

New Zealand’s eight-man crew embraced and cheered on the deck of the 75-foot Taihoro after holding Britannia off to win Race 9.

“It is just sinking in. What an amazing day, this team has been amazing, what an amazing feeling,” New Zealand skipper Peter Burling said after his America’s Cup finals-record 22nd race win.

[Britannia](https://apnews.com/article/americas-cup-cyclors-carr-britannia-8b0f889dbfcff7ac402b27eac8a12c3b), meanwhile, fell one step short of bringing the Auld Mug home to Britain for the first time in the competition’s 173-year history.

“A huge well done to Team New Zealand, what an amazing campaign and team,” Britannia skipper Ben Ainslie said. “In my view they are the best team ever in the America’s Cup.”
