![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/2078975.jpg)Over the weekend, *[HMS Bounty](http://www.tallshipbounty.org/)*, on the first stop of her four month European tour, was boarded by buccaneers on  the [Barbican in Plymouth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbican,_Plymouth).   [Plymouth’s “Pirate Days”](http://www.plymouthbuzz.com/pirate-days-plymouth-england/) coincided with the release of the latest Disney ‘Pirates of the Caribbean” movie, “[On Stranger Tides.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1298650/)”   The [Plymouth Herald noted,](http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/news/swashbuckling-day-Barbican/article-3582743-detail/article.html) “*An authentic Captain Jack Sparrow look-a-like – albeit not Hollywood star Johnny Depp himself – joined HMS Bounty’s Captain Robin Wallbridge on board.*”    HMS *Bounty* was featured in a previous movie, “[Pirates of the Caribbean – Dead Man’s Chest.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383574/)”

The most recent iteration of the movie franchise, which opened on Friday, has earned a [Rotten Tomatoes rating of only 33%,](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides/) the lowest of any of the four “Pirate of the Caribbean” movies.  Our 14 year old in-house reviewer gives it a slightly better rating, opining that “it was better than the third one, but not as good as the first two.”
