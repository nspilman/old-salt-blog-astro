![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/12/Statsraad-Lehmkuhl.jpg)The Norwegian sail training ship [*Statsraad Lehmkuhl*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statsraad_Lehmkuhl) will be visiting New York harbor next week. The three-masted barque, built in 1914, will be docking at [Brooklyn Bridge Park](https://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/) and will be available for tours from December 19 to 27, from 11:30am to 4:45pm. 

**Update: Since our original post, the tours are now fully booked.**

The event will be hosted by the Institute of Marine Research, [*Statsraad Lehmkuhl*](https://lehmkuhl.no/en/), and Team Norway. During the tour you may meet some of the scientists and researchers that are doing research on board, Norwegian companies showcasing their ocean technologies and local partners. You will also experience the exhibition on board – on deck – as you are served hot Norwegian fish soup and warm beverages.

Now a state-of-the-art mobile research laboratory, the 107-year-old *Lehmkuhl* is circumnavigating the globe until April 2023 under the flag of [The One Ocean Expedition](https://oneoceanexpedition.com/), a part of the United Nations’ Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. New York is one of 36 ports that the *Statsraad Lehmkuhl* will visit during The One Ocean Expedition circumnavigation.
