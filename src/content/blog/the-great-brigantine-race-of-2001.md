Talk about match racing!  This Sunday off Newport Beach, CA, two identical brigantines, the *[Irving Johnson](http://www.brigantines.com/default.html)* [and the *Exy Johnson*](http://www.brigantines.com/default.html), will race.  They will be manned by crews from rival local clubs, the Bahia Corinthian and Balboa Yacht clubs, under the supervision of the brigantine’s permanent captains and crews.  The *Irving Johnson* and the *Exy Johnson* are two identical 90′ brigantines launched in 2002, named in honor of the the husband and wife team who sailed the brigantine *Yankee* four times around the world over eleven years.  The two brigantines are part of the [Los Angeles Maritime Institute’s “TopSail Youth Program,](http://www.lamitopsail.org/)” a sail training “education and adventure” program.
