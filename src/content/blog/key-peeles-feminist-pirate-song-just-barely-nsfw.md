The sketch comedy team of [Key and Peele](http://www.cc.com/shows/key-and-peele) have come up with what may be the very first feminist pirate song, examining issues of respect, equality and consent, as sung by a bunch of scurvy sea dogs. (It is just barely Not-Safe-For-Work. If you listen very carefully to the lyrics, there is one clinical reference to oral sex.) The chorus goes: “*We’d say ‘yo ho!’ / But we don’t say ‘ho’ / ‘Cause ‘ho’ is disrespectful, yo!”* Thanks to Irwin Bryan for pointing out the sketch.
