The presumed death toll remains at 32 in the sinking of the *Costa Concordia.*  Today divers located eight more bodies, bringing the number of known dead to 25 while the number of missing and presumed dead dropped to 7.  Only three of the bodies; woman, a girl and a man, were removed from the ship due to worsening weather conditions.  The bodies were taken ashore for identification, a process that can take several days.  One of the bodies was identified, however, as Dayana Arlotti, who was five years old, the only young girl to be lost in the tragedy.  Her father is still listed among the missing.
