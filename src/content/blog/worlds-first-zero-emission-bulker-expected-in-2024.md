[![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/orcapbn1.jpg)Marine Log](https://www.marinelog.com/shipping/environment/worlds-first-zero-emission-bulker-planned-to-debut-in-2024/) reports that Norwegian shipping firm Egil Ulvan Rederi has been awarded a contract to build what is claimed will be the world’s first zero-emission bulk carrier.

The 88-meter, 5,000 DWT self-unloading vessel will be used on a Norwegian route to transport aggregates from Heidelberg Cement Norway in western Norway in one direction and grain from farmer-owned cooperative Felleskjøpet AGRI, in eastern Norway, on the backhaul.

The ship design concept was developed in close cooperation with [Norwegian Ship Design — TNSDC](https://www.norwegianshipdesign.no/archive/with-orca-powered-by-nature) — and has the project name “With Orca – Powered by Nature.” The ship will be propelled by a hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engine assisted by two rotor sails. Hydrogen will be stored in compressed form onboard.

The ship concept will be fully developed and optimized this year, with the aim being to place an order with a shipyard by the end of the year. Plans are for it to enter operation in early 2024.
