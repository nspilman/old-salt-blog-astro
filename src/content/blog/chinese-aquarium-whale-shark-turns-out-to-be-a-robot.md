![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/robotwhaleshark.jpg)After being closed for five years for renovations, the [Xiaomeisha Sea World](https://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/guangdong/shenzhen/xiaomeisha-sea-world.htm) aquarium in Shenzhen, China reopened its doors on October 1. During its week-long trial run, the 60,000 sqm sea park attracted around 100,000 visitors who each paid around $40 to enter the aquarium. But, much to their disappointment, they discovered that the giant whale shark on display was, in reality, a robot.

Many social media users posted under the hashtag “Netizens complain about spending hundreds of yuan at Xiaomeisha Sea World to see fake fish.”

A user on Chinese social media shared their disappointment after visiting, stating, “I was so excited to see the ‘whale shark exhibit,’ but instead found a mechanical shark. While I understand the need for animal protection, I’d rather they didn’t include a fake one; it detracted from the experience.”

In response, the park said that whale sharks are not allowed to be traded and keeping a real one in captivity would be cruel, while the robot was meant to raise awareness for protecting the species, local media reported.

Inside the park, a sign introducing the robot shark read that it intended to “inspire everyone to understand the animals and their environment” and “with the aim of protecting the ecological environment.”

A company in Shenyang announced in August that it had produced the world’s first intelligent robotic whale shark that could swim, float, dive, open and close its mouth. The bionic shark was nearly five meters long and weighed 350kg, state media CGTN reported.

The shark could be operated remotely and came equipped with features such as programmed-controlled swimming and multi-joint bionic propulsion. The robot could swim at a maximum speed of 0.7m per second and dive 20m deep, according to CGTN.

Not everyone is upset by the robotic whale shark. [In Defense of Animals](https://www.idausa.org/campaign/cetacean-advocacy/latest-news/media-release-campaigners-welcome-chinas-robot-whale-shark/), an international animal protection organization, “welcomes the forward-thinking alternative to using live animals to educate and entertain visitors.”

“In Defense of Animals is thrilled to see Xiaomeisha Sea World taking a step toward more compassionate entertainment with its animatronic whale shark,” said Hannah Williams, Cetacean Consultant for In Defense of Animals. “We hope this move encourages people to reconsider why they feel entitled to see live marine animals in confinement — especially when it comes to species who are known to suffer extreme psychological and physical harm as a result of captivity — and that that this aquarium will continue to lead the way with more exhibits that don’t use live animals.”
