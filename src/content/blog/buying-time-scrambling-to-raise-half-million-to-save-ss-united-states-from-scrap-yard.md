![ssus2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ssus2.jpg)The [SS United States Conservancy](https://www.savetheunitedstates.org/) is scrambling to raise $500,000 to buy time in their effort to save the ex-passenger liner *[SS United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States).*  If they fail, the ship could be sold for scrap.  The conservancy is exploring potential partnerships with four entities in Philadelphia and New York City to refashion the vessel as a stationary entertainment complex with 500,000 square feet of space for a hotel, theater, restaurants and shopping, but no deal has been made and time is running out.  It  costs $80,000 a month just for mooring, basic maintenance, insurance and security for the old ship at her berth in Philadelphia.
