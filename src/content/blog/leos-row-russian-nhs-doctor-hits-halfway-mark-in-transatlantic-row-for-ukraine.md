![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/happyfeet.jpg)[Dr Leo Krivskiy](https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/24651031.meet-russian-nhs-doctor-rowing-3-374-miles-ukraine/), a doctor with the UK’s National Health Service, is rowing 2,630 nautical miles solo across the Atlantic to raise money for medics in Ukraine in a 6m (20ft) ocean rowing boat called [*Happy Socks*](https://ukrivski.com/leos-row/).

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79dpyrexevo) reports that he has reached the midway point. The Moscow-born consultant anesthetist at Southampton General Hospital is 1,210 nautical miles from the finish in Barbados and says that he had not seen a ship for more than three weeks. He set off from Gran Canaria on Boxing Day and has currently raised more than £23,000.

He said he was averaging about 30 miles per day but trade winds were making life rough on board with large waves, “it’s a slow journey, it’s a slog but physically I’m holding up”.

On his website, [Leo’s Row](https://www.leosrow.com/), he describes himself as a doctor by trade and an adventurer by heart. He considers his attempt to row solo across the Atlantic as a test of his own resilience and mental fortitude, but also a mission to support a cause very close to his heart – his Ukraine Medical Charity, [Ukrops](https://www.leosrow.com/charity).

He writes:  “Driven to test my limits and learn beyond my comfort zone, I embark on a journey not just for self-growth, but to fuel a deeper mission: supporting Ukrainian medics. Every challenge I face and overcome strengthens my resolve to make a meaningful impact, blending personal development with a heartfelt dedication to those in need. This adventure is about more than acquiring skills; it’s a commitment to making a real difference to people’s lives through knowledge, compassion, and action.”
