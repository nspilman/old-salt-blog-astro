USS New York

Tomorrow the [USS *New York*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_New_York_\(LPD-21\) ) returns to the Hudson River to help kick off [Fleet Week New York](https://www.facebook.com/FleetWeekNewYork).  The USS *New York* (LPD-21) is the fifth *[San Antonio-class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_class_amphibious_transport_dock)* amphibious transport dock ship and is the seventh ship of the United States Navy to be named after the state of New York.   Parts of the bow and stern of the ship were fabricated using over seven tons of steel salvaged from the World Trade Center, after it was destroyed in the September 11 attacks.  Earlier this year [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/01/22/uss-new-york-%E2%80%93-bad-welding-and-failed-bearings/) about problems that the ship had with bad bearings and undersized welds. After an extended repair period, the ship is said to be in good shape and will participating in the parade of ships up the Hudson from 8:30 AM to 12 noon tomorrow.
