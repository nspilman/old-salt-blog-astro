![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gretaarrivesnyc.png)Accompanied by a flotilla of well-wishers, 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, [Greta Thunberg](https://classicsailor.com/2019/08/greta-thunberg-sets-sail-from-plymouth/), [sailed into New York harbor today](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/28/754818342/teen-climate-activist-greta-thunberg-arrives-in-new-york-after-sailing-the-atlan) on the foiling monohull IMOCA 60, *[Malizia II](https://www.imoca.org/en/imoca/boats/malizia-ii-yacht-club-de-monaco)*. Greta is on her way to UN climate talks being held in September. To avoid the carbon footprint of flying, the young activist chose to sail across the Atlantic on the racing yacht, which has an almost zero carbon footprint. She set sail from Plymouth, England on August 14th.

One might quibble about the choice of means of transportation or even suggest [carbon offsets](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/airlines-that-offer-carbon-offset-programs.php) to counter the footprint of the air flight. Nevertheless, it is hard not to admire this teenager’s spirit and the example that she sets.
