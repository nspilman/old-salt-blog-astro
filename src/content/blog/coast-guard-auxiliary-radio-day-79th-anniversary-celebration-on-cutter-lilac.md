![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/05/bowspritelilac.jpg)This Saturday, October 20, from 1:00 to 5:00 PM at Manhattan’s Pier 25, at West Street and N. Moore Street, on the Hudson River, the retired [U.S. Coast Guard Cutter](http://www.lilacpreservationproject.org) *Lilac* will be hosting a celebration of 79th anniversary of the founding of the US Coast Guard Auxiliary with a special Radio Day event.  The Lower Manhattan Flotilla of the Auxiliary will install a ham radio station on the *Liliac* which will open to the public especially for the afternoon.  Visitors will be able to learn about the importance of radio in maritime communications by observing operators send and receive messages as part of this nationwide Radio Day. 

Auxiliarists will be on hand to discuss their work and provide information on recreational boating safety, a key part of their mission to support the Coast Guard. As always, *Lilac*‘s volunteers will share the ship’s story with visitors who wish to take a tour. 

*Lilac* is a retired Coast Guard cutter that carried supplies to lighthouses and maintained buoys from 1933 to 1972.  USCGC *Lilac* is America’s only surviving steam-powered lighthouse tender and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

*Lilac* is now a museum ship, owned and operated by the non-profit [Lilac Preservation Project](http://www.lilacpreservationproject.org) and is open for tours, exhibits, and events during the Summer season while undergoing restoration.
