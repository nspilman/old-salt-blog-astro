![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/10/b9ship.jpg)[B9 Shipping](http://www.b9shipping.com/) and the [Greenheart Project](http://www.greenheartproject.org/en/vessel_des.html) are both working to develop new high-tech sailing coasters.  B9 has in mind a 3,000 DWT three masted bulk carrier with automated square sails whereas the [Greenheart Project](http://www.greenheartproject.org/en/index.html) envisions a much smaller fore and aft rigged general cargo ship.   They both look intriguing. Whether or not they would be economically viable is still unclear. By the standards of today, a 3,000 DWT bulk carrier is quite small. Nevertheless, it is roughly the same size as the great windjammers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  A B9 Shipping promotional video, after the jump.
