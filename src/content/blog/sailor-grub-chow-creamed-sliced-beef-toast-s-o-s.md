![chow](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/chow.jpg)Yesterday, we posted about a project to recreate sailor’s grub from the 17th century. Food for sailors has improved dramatically in the last three hundred years. Or has it?  The [Naval Historical Foundation](http://www.navyhistory.org/) has a new blog titled CHOW which explores the history behind U.S. Navy culinary traditions. A [recent blog post](http://www.navyhistory.org/2016/04/chow-creamed-sliced-beef-on-toast-s-o-s/) looks at creamed sliced beef on toast, a Navy and Army breakfast, served for breakfast and universally known as “S\_\_t on a Shingle” or “S.O.S.”

From their post: *The exact origin of S.O.S. is fuzzy. According to Wentworth and Flexner’s 1967 Dictionary of American Slang, no specific origin is known. The dish, which consists of sliced dried beef mixed in a thick creamy gravy, appeared in military cookbooks at the start of the twentieth century. Some cooking sources, such as the online website “Seabee Cook,” claim the dish came from the Army. Steve Karoly, who authored an article on the subject, claims the “Army favorite” has become “the most popular version of SOS.” Some Navy veterans may disagree.
