![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/colefirstlight2.jpg)Congratulations to [Cole Brauer](https://www.instagram.com/colebraueroceanracing/?hl=en), who finished second in the [Global Solo Challenge](https://globalsolochallenge.com/), becoming the first American woman to race solo nonstop around the world, traveling roughly 28,000 miles, in her 40′ sailboat *First Light*. 

Brauer, at 29 years old, was also the youngest and only woman in the fleet of 16 competitors that set sail in October from A Coruna, Spain.  She arrived back in A Coruna last Thursday after a 130-day circumnavigation, rounding the three great capes.

Standing at 5’2″ and weighing 100 pounds, she faced a grueling race in which more than half of the competitors have dropped out, so far. 

During the voyage, she encountered 30-foot waves that tossed her about the boat, injuring a rib. She even gave herself an IV to fend off dehydration.

Sailing solo means not just being a skipper but a project manager, said Marco Nannini, the race’s organizer. That means steering the vessel, making repairs, knowing the weather and keeping yourself healthy, he told the [AP](https://apnews.com/article/cole-brauer-sailboat-race-american-woman-c62f806bc011c29faf88f8a9b048953b).

“The biggest asset is your mental strength, not the physical one,” Nannini said. “Cole is showing everyone that.”

She told a reporter that her goal was to race around the world before she was thirty, and she indeed succeeded.
