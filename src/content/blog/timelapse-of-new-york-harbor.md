I love sitting and just watching the harbor; watching the boats go by and the turn of the tide.   But who has the time these days?  For those too busy and/or  not geographically convenient, here is  about four hours of New York harbor just off the Battery in 42 seconds from [John Huntington’s blog](http://www.controlgeek.net/blog/2011/6/21/new-york-harbor-timelapse.html).   Thanks to [bowsprite](http://bowsprite.wordpress.com/) for passing the clip along
