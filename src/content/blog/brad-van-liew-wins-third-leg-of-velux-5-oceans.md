*The race’s latest leg—the third of five—took the solo sailor and his three competitors through the Southern Ocean’s most remote point, more than 2,000 nautical miles from land. The skippers also rounded the infamous Cape Horn, where Van Liew became the only American to race three times around the landmark singlehanded.*

*“Three legs won and three times round Cape Horn safely—those are two very important facts for me, two massive hurdles,” Van Liew said from the dock. “It’s nice to have a nice point lead now, and it’s nice to be back here in Punta. It’s a fantastic place here and I have missed it.”*
