![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kayakerrescue.jpg)The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63424568) reports that a Dutch fishing vessel has rescued a British kayaker found clinging to a buoy in the Channel after his kayak capsized. He is reported to have been holding onto the buoy for several days.

The captain, Teunis de Boer, said he had by chance seen the kayaker waving frantically as his boat *Madeleine* sailed past.

“He was clearly in distress,” the captain told Dutch media.

After the man was given water and a chocolate bar, he was airlifted to a hospital in nearby Boulogne by French authorities.

The drama unfolded late on Thursday morning several miles west off the French coast, in a shipping lane of the Dover Strait, also known as the Pas de Calais.

The boat captain said he was checking they were not steering too close to the Colbart Nord buoy when he suddenly saw something moving around on it. “I picked up the binoculars and saw a young man just in his swimming trunks waving at us like a madman,” he told De Telegraaf website.

“He was covered in bruises and explained that he’d stayed alive by scraping mussels off the buoy and eating little crabs and seaweed,” De Boer told public broadcaster NOS. He was dehydrated and suffering from hypothermia, so the crew wrapped him in blankets.

What is less clear is how long he had survived clinging to the buoy. The fishing boat captain said the man had told them he had left Dover in his kayak on 15 October, 12 days before he was picked up.

In a statement, the French maritime prefect for the Channel and North Sea said, however, that he had left Dover around 48 hours earlier.
