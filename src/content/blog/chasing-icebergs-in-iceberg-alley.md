Every year, in “[Iceberg Alley](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/newfoundland-coast-iceberg-alley)“, a stretch of water curving along the eastern coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, hundreds of icebergs drift by.

Recently, one such iceberg was caught on video and posted on [X (ex-Twitter)](https://twitter.com/SpriterTeam/status/1686382579044560896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1686382579044560896%7Ctwgr%5Efb39919ea1bb60dcdb5e90920a5765cc622fb5dd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hindustantimes.com%2Fworld-news%2Fgiant-iceberg-approaching-canadian-island-of-newfoundland-stuns-netizens-watch-101690992219493.html) where it quickly went viral, with almost 12 million views.

There were enough viewers who doubted whether the video was real to justify a reality check by the fact-checking site [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/giant-iceberg-newfoundland-canada/), which concluded that the video was indeed genuine, although the video had been originally posted on [TikTok on July](https://www.tiktok.com/@emoinuoinam/video/7255355542359575813) 13 near Conche, Newfoundland.

While the berg captured in the video was massive, [it was not unusual](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/04/newfoundlands-iceberg-alley-bergs-threaten-ships-attract-torusits/). Between [400 to 800 icebergs](https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/iceberg-alley-canada-facts) drift through Iceberg Alley every year.  The icebergs threaten shipping lanes as well as [attracting tourists](https://www.flyovercanada.com/stories/inside-the-scene-the-newfoundland-mystique/) drawn to the majesty of the massive floating ice mountains.

In 1912, the *Titanic* sank after colliding with an iceberg that drifted from Iceberg Alley.
