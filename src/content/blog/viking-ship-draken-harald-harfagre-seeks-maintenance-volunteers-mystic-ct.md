![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/maintaindrakar.jpg)Next weekend, the Viking Ship *Draken Harald Hårfagre* is seeking volunteers to help maintain the ship before it sets sails again this summer. Or as they put it, “Spring is here, and the Viking Ship *Draken Harald Hårfagre* needs some extra love before summer!”  The *Draken*, the largest replica Viking ship ever built, spent last winter laid up at the [Mystic Seaport Museum](https://www.mysticseaport.org/) in Mystic, CT after completing an epic trans-Atlantic voyage.  The *Draken Harald Hårfagre* is 114 feet, with a beam of 27 feet, displacing seventy tons, with a 3,200 square foot sail of pure silk. Helping to maintain the ship is a great way to get up close and personal with this treasure of living maritime history.

From the [Draken Harald Hårfagre Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DrakenHaraldHarfagre/?hc_ref=NEWSFEED&fref=nf):

*Take the chance to get to know the Ship and some of her crew better for a few days in Mystic Seaport, Connecticut, USA:*

*– During the weekend the 6th to 7th of May we’ll be needing about 10 volunteers (for an overall hull and ballast check).*

*– From the 8th to the 10th of May we’ll be needing about 3-5 volunteers (giving some love to the floorboards and wooden details above deck).*

*Basic accommodation will be available in the tent onboard, and food will be provided. During Saturday evening one of the crew will hold a presentation about her experience during the adventurous Atlantic crossing last summer. Interested to join? Send us an e-mail (with volunteer in the subject field) to: info@drakenexpeditionamerica.com*

*We are very thankful for your help!*
