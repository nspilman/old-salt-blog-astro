Yesterday the 7,000 DWT chemical tanker *[YM Uranus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_YM_Uranus)* carrying pyrogas gasoline was in a collision with the 197,000 DWT bulker *[Hanjin Rizhao](http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Hanjin-Rizhao-9490882.html)* off the coast of Brittany.  Contrary to early reports that the chemical tanker was sinking, she remained afloat, despite a significant list, with no loss of cargo.  Her crew abandoned ship and was picked up by the French Navy.  The YM Uranus is now under tow to the port of Brest.
