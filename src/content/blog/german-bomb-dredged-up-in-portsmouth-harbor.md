![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/germanbomb1.jpg)In 2011, a drought lowered the levels of the Rhine River, revealing [unexploded munitions from World War II](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/bombs-along-the-rhine-drought-exposing-wwii-unexploded-munitions/) partially buried in the river banks exposed by the falling waters. Now, in Portsmouth harbor in the UK, World War II bombs are also being uncovered, not due to a drought but from dredging. On Wednesday, one of the dredges discovered what is a believed to be a [German SC250 bomb](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-39049048), weighing 500 lbs, containing 290 lbs of “high explosives.”  The harbor is being dredged to deepen and widen a four-mile channel to allow the the navy’s new 65,000-tonne aircraft carriers to dock. From the [Royal Navy](http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2017/february/22/170222-royal-navy-divers-destroy-500lb-wartime-ordnance) website:

*The entrance to Portsmouth Harbour was closed until around 7.30am as a precaution while the bomb disposal team assessed the swiftest and safest way of removing the device. Divers from the Royal Navy’s Portsmouth-based Southern Diving Unit 2 towed the bomb away from the harbour, lowered it to the seabed, and planted explosive charges for a controlled detonation of the device. Shortly after 11am, it was destroyed in a plume of smoke and spray.*

This is not the first ordnance from World War II discovered in the latest dredging.  A week ago, the bomb disposal divers were called out to blow up up a [British-made Armstrong Whitworth munition](http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2017/february/17/170217-royal-navy-bomb-disposal-experts-detonate--wartime-device-found-in-portsmouth-harbour) which had been found in the excavator head of a barge dredging the harbor.

In [late September](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/30/giant-wartime-bomb-found-in-portsmouth-harbour-to-be-exploded-at/) and [early November](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2194831/portsmouth-harbour-closed-due-to-unexploded-german-bomb-causing-travel-chaos-for-cross-channel-ferries/) of last year, the dredging also uncovered two 500 kg (1,102 lb) World War II bombs, which were also detonated.
