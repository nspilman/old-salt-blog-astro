![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/whiteisland2.jpg)The most up to date information we have now is that there were 47 people on New Zealand’s White Island when the [volcano billed as “one of the world’s most active volcano” erupted.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/12/deadly-volcanic-eruption-on-new-zealands-white-island-5-dead-and-more-than-20-missing/) There are now six confirmed dead, five who died on the island and one person who died on the way to the hospital. Early reports suggested that over 20 people were missing. Fortunately, that number has fallen to eight. The bad news is that all of the missing are presumed to be dead, bringing the current death toll to a likely 14. 

Of the survivors, 31 suffered burns, many of which were serious. [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/asia/new-zealand-white-island-volcano-intl-hnk/index.html) reports that almost all patients who were injured in the deadly New Zealand volcanic eruption have suffered extensive burns to their bodies and lungs, as questions mount over the circumstances surrounding the tragedy that has left at least six people dead.

Every burns unit in the country is at full capacity as medical staff do all they can to treat those with severe injuries from the volcanic ash and gas, Ministry of Health spokesman Pete Watson said Tuesday.

Out of the 31 people still in the hospital, 27 had burns to at least 30% of their bodies and many have inhalation burns that require airway support. Given the extent of survivors’ injuries, the death toll could continue to rise. “It’s possible that not all patients will survive,” Watson said.

A number of passengers on Royal Caribbean’s *Ovation of the Seas* were on an excursion to the island when the eruption took place. The ship has delayed its sailing from nearby Tauranga. The ship had been scheduled to depart for Wellington.

A spokesperson for the Royal Caribbean cruise line told the [Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&objectid=12292334) that the ship will remain in Tauranga overnight.

“We can confirm that a number of our guests were touring the island today. We do not have any additional details to share at this time.

“Ovation of the Seas will remain overnight until we learn more about the situation. We will offer all possible assistance to our guests and local authorities.” 

Continued volcanic eruptions have limited access to the island. Police said they plan to fly drones carrying equipment to test gas levels, though crews were largely kept away from the Island on Tuesday.

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/12/10/new-zealand-volcano/) reports that GeoNet, which monitors geological hazards in New Zealand, [placed the volcano alert level at a three out of a five-point scale](https://www.geonet.org.nz/vabs/2xlBQM4MAMkxUAJSfF48rP), or “minor volcanic eruption.” The alert level had been a two a week before the incident.

New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said “bigger questions” will have to be answered as to why tourists were allowed on the island with the country’s most active volcano.
