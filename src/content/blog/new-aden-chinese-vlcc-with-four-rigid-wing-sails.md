![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/10/newaden.jpg)In 2020, we posted that China Merchants Group had signed a contract with Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company (DSIC) for [two Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) each with four rigid wing sails](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/05/very-large-tankers-sailing-on-wind-and-bubbles-of-air/) to provide wind-assisted propulsion.

The first of the two ships, the [*New Aden*, has now been delivered and features four wing sails](https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-delivers-first-vlcc-equipped-with-four-rigid-sails), each approximately 130 feet tall, totaling nearly 13,000 square feet of sail area, made of carbon fiber composite material. The sails are trimmed by a fully automatic system to maximize their efficiency. The new ship is 1,092 feet long and 300,000 DWT.

The *New Aden* is not the first VLCC to be equipped with wind-assisted propulsion. In 2018, China Merchants took delivery of the [*New Vitality*, a 300,000 DWT tanker with two rigid wing sails.](https://www.bairdmaritime.com/ship-world/tanker-world/vlcc-equipped-with-novel-sail-propulsion-system-completes-sea-trials/) The sail-assist provided on the *New Vitality* must have been successful, as the new ships have double the number of wing sails of their near sister vessel.

According to DSIC and its parent company CSSC, the vessel’s design was designed for operations between the Middle East and the Far East. “The *New Aden* pays more attention to the optimization of the ship’s operating performance, reduces the ship’s operating fuel consumption, and enhances the ship’s sailing performance in wind and waves,” said CSSC. They estimate that the tanker in operation will achieve an annual fuel savings of 9.8 percent and more than 2,900 tons of carbon. The vessel is also fitted with the latest SOx and NOx technologies to reduce emissions, meeting the EEDI and EEXI standards.
