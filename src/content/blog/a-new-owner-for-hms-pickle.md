![HMSPicklereplica2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/HMSPicklereplica2.jpg)We have been following the 1995 built replica of the topsail schooner HMS *Pickle* for some time. In 2008, [she was offered for sale](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/07/hm-schooner-pickel-for-sale-on-ebay/) for £350,000.00 (US$626,640). In July, [she reappeared on the market on E-Bay](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/07/hm-schooner-pickel-for-sale-on-ebay/) where the winning bid was £69,500.00. The Seller’s Notes of Ebay read: “*Pickle is in need of some work to bring her up to scratch*.”  The original [HMS *Pickle*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Pickle_\(1800\)) was the first ship to bring the news of Nelson’s great victory and tragic death at Trafalgar back to England.

An article in [In the Boatshed](http://intheboatshed.net/2014/09/01/malcolm-nicholson-buys-pickle/), identifies the owner as Malcolm Nicholson who also owns the 1926 iron hull Humber sloop [*Spider T*](http://www.spidert.co.uk/about.html).   From [In the Boat Shed](http://intheboatshed.net/2014/09/01/malcolm-nicholson-buys-pickle/):

*The schooner is currently moored in Ocean Village in Gibraltar and is undergoing repairs. After many years of owning and running Spider T, I’m quite certain Mal knows what he’s in for – but great good luck to him and his helpers.*

*Previous owner Robin James’s family has owned Pickle for the past nine years. He said that the decision to sell the ship had been extremely difficult : ‘I have poured my soul into her over the past nine years, and in return she has carried me and many new friends safely through storms and adventures.*

*‘But after a difficult voyage to Gibraltar followed by a failure to get the much needed support to make her a success, this is the best decision to secure her future. The decision to sell Pickle has been made far easier by finding Mal, who I trust to continue to care for her and get her sailing again, while continuing to share her with everybody from her past, present and future.’*

*Mal said that during her time with Robin, Pickle had won many friends and supporters, and achieved amazing things.*

*For information see the [Pickle facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/schoonerpickle)  where he will post information future plans for the vessel, and will be re-developing the website [www.schoonerpickle.com](http://www.schoonerpickle.com/).*
