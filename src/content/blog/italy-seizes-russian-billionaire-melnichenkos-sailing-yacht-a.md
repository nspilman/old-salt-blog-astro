![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sailingyachta1.jpg)Russian billionaire Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko’s superyacht [*Sailing Yacht A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_\(sailing_yacht\)) is nothing if not distinctive. It is one of the largest sail-assisted vessels afloat, with a singularly terrible name, and is arguably the ugliest large yacht in service. It is also the most recent superyacht to be seized as part of international sanctions resulting from Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italy-seizes-russian-oligarch-melnichenkos-sailing-yacht-2022-03-12/?utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A%20Trending%20Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR2h6BsxEeMq83RH_p7V94HsEQO8k67YAy9CS8mJdV2XgcheDQLmB3IUCjo) reports that Italian police have seized the superyacht, valued at $580 million, the prime minister’s office said on Saturday, a few days after Melnichenko was placed on an EU sanctions list following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. *Sailing Yacht A* has been sequestered at the northern port of Trieste, the government said.

At 12,700 tonnes, it is the largest sailing yacht in the world by gross tonnage. At 470 feet, she is the longest sailing yacht in existence. Its 300-foot tall carbon fiber masts are the largest composite freestanding structures in the world. Her 40,330 sq ft three-masted schooner rig is 8,000 sq ft larger than the rig on the tea clipper [*Cutty Sark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark). And the yacht — a slab-sided, eight decked, angular monstrosity — does qualify as perhaps the ugliest sailing vessel in the world.

Since last week Italian police have seized villas and yachts worth more than 700 million euros ($763.63 million) from high-profile Russians who have been placed on the EU sanctions list, Economy Minister Daniele Franco said on Saturday.
