![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/10/oldestshipbaltic.jpg)In the dark and oxygenless waters of the Black Sea two miles below the surface, a team of maritime archaeologists, scientists and surveyors has discovered what it believes to be the world’s oldest intact shipwreck. Carbon dating suggests that the wreck is more than 2,400 years ago. A remote-controlled submarine piloted by British scientists spotted the 75 foot Greek trading lying on its side about 50 miles off the coast of Bulgaria. The vessel was found lying whole with its mast, rudders and rowing benches in place.

The ship is believed to have been a trading vessel of a type that researchers have only seen represented on ancient Greek pottery.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/23/oldest-intact-shipwreck-thought-to-be-ancient-greek-discovered-at-bottom-of-black-sea) quotes Professor Jon Adams, the principal investigator with the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project (MAP), saying, “A ship surviving intact from the classical world, lying in over 2km of water, is something I would never have believed possible. This will change our understanding of shipbuilding and seafaring in the ancient world.”

“It’s when the ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) drops down through the water column, and you see this ship appear in the light at the bottom so perfectly preserved, it feels like you step back in time,” Helen Farr, an archeologist working on the expedition, told [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45951132).
