PT-728

Last April, [we posted that PT-728, a World War II Patrol Torpedo boat, was listed as for sale in the Hammacher Schlemmer catalog](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/01/pt-728-world-war-ii-patrol-torpedo-boat-for-sale-in-hammacher-schlemmer-catalog/).   The vintage PT boat has now been purchased by the newly opened [Liberty Aviation Museum](http://libertyaviationmuseum.org/) in Port Clinton Ohio.  She recently passed through Cleveland on her way to her new berth.   PT-728 will be one of two PT boats at the new museum.  The new museum has also acquired [PT-724](http://libertyaviationmuseum.org/x_pt724.html  ), which has been converted to a private yacht. The museum intends to restore the boat to its World War II configuration.  Thanks to Phil Leon for passing along the news.
