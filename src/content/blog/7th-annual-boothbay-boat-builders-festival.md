![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ship_undersquare_tnail.jpg)We hope everyone has a  great time at today’s [7th Annual Boothbay Boat Builders Festival](http://www.bbrlt.org/bbrlt_boatbuilders.html).   All should keep a a weather eye out as there are rumors of an attack by the [Pirates of the Dark Rose](http://www.darkrosepirates.com/ship.htm), followed by a get-together for the kids with the pirates in the Story & Sing-a-Long tent!  We wish all pirates were as entertaining and well behaved.
