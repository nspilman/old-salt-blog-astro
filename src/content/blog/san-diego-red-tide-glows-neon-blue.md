The surf in San Diego county has been putting on quite a light show on recent evenings. The shore has been hit by a bout of “red tide,”  a bloom of the dinoflagellate *[Lingulodinium polyedrum](http://deepseanews.com/2011/09/the-san-diego-red-tide-faq-from-scripps-professor-dr-peter-franks/).*  The bad news is that this dinoflagellate can be toxic to fish and shellfish. The good news is that it is wildly bio-luminescent turning the Pacific waves a soft neon blue as they break on the beach.  See our [post about red tide in New York harbor](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/09/07/new-york-harbor-weekend-racing-tug-boats-and-red-tide/) around this time last year.
