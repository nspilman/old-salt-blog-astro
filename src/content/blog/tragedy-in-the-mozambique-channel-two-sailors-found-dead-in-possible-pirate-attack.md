![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/sibly.jpg)Australian sailor Deirdre “Cookie” Sibly, 67, and French sailor Pascal Mahe have been found dead on the yacht *[Acteon](https://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Acteon-I2277135.html),* sailing in the Mozambique Channel, around 200 miles north east of Beira, Mozambique.  *Acteon* is a 50-foot sloop registered in France. The pair, both described by relatives and friends as highly capable mariners, had left Reunion Island in June with the intention of reaching South Africa, stopping in Durban before continuing to Cape Town.

A distress signal was transmitted from the yacht on the evening of Nov 26. A nearby cargo vessel responded and notified French authorities after attempting without success to make contact with those on board. The ship’s crew approached the drifting yacht but could not safely board. That ship was then joined by a cargo ship and a maxi yacht to assist. There was no sign of life on the boat when the first responding ship attempted to make contact.

Sailors from one of those vessels eventually managed to get onto the *Acteon* on Nov 28 at 10 a.m., where they discovered the bodies of a man and a woman. 

On Dec 1, the yacht remained adrift under sail and was being monitored, with a last known position: 19°25.58 S 038°55.48 E. Arrangements were made for its recovery and for the continuation of the investigation.

The two sailors met on Réunion Island in June and later set sail down the Mozambique Channel towards Durban, where the 67-year-old Australian had planned to fly home. Sibly had been travelling across the Indian Ocean since June and was well-known among her friends as an adventurous sailor who spent much of her life on the water.

The Mozambique Channel is widely regarded as a dangerous region for maritime travel due to harsh sea conditions influenced by the Agulhas Current, which can generate powerful rogue waves. It also sits within a cyclone-prone area often referred to as “Cyclone Alley”.

Some relatives have suggested to the media that piracy might be a possible explanation, given the region’s history of maritime crime. Authorities, however, have not confirmed any link and say that investigations remain ongoing.

Sibly’s sister noted that the channel was not a safe place to sail and that Sibly had been aware of the risks. Concerns about maritime violence in the region have grown in recent years. Security assessments have previously indicated that South-East African waters have become increasingly attractive to pirate groups searching for poorly defended vessels. These incidents have targeted both recreational and commercial craft moving through areas such as the Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa. Authorities were working to determine how the tragic deaths occurred. Sibly’s family said they are hoping for clarity as the investigation continued.
