The [Hardtackers Shanty Crew](http://www.hardtackers.com/) put out a fine new promotional video just a week or two before the publication of my new novel, [*The Shantyman*](http://www.amazon.com/Shantyman-Rick-Spilman-ebook/dp/B00T57OQYA/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8).  The events are unrelated but feel fortuitous. [See our review](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/08/hardtackers-dont-forget-your-old-shipmates-a-review/) of the Hardtacker’s CD, *[Don’t Forget Your Old Shipmates](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Forget-Your-Old-Shipmates/dp/B00DBIYKCM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1375641597&sr=8-2&keywords=hardtackers++don%27t+forget+your+old+shipmates)*, from about a year and a half ago. The CD and the new video are both well worth a listen.
