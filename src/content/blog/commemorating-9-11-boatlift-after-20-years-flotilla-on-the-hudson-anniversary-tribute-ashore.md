Following the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks") in New York City, more than 500,000 people were unable to leave Lower Manhattan due to the closure of [bridges and tunnels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bridges_and_tunnels_in_New_York_City "List of bridges and tunnels in New York City") throughout the city. Within minutes of the first plane hitting the [first tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Trade_Center#Original_building "One World Trade Center"), multiple [fireboats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireboat "Fireboat") from the [New York City Fire Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Fire_Department "New York City Fire Department") rushed to the scene. The United States Coast Guard coordinated a large [convoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy "Convoy") of [merchant ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_ship "Merchant ship"), [tugboats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tugboats "Tugboats"), and [ferries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ferries_across_the_Hudson_River_to_New_York_City "List of ferries across the Hudson River to New York City") to evacuate the stranded and injured victims.

More than 150 different vessels and 600 sailors helped evacuate victims and delivered supplies in the days following the attacks. According to the [Commandant of the Coast Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandant_of_the_Coast_Guard) [James Loy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Loy "James Loy"), the mass evacuation of more than 500,000 civilians following the attacks “moved more people from the island than the [1940 evacuation of Allied troops from France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation "Dunkirk evacuation").”
