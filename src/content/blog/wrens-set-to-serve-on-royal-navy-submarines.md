![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wrens.jpg)What I found surprising about the headline in the [Mail Online](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1335741/Wrens-serve-Navy-submarines-bunks-avoid-hot-bedding.html?ITO=1490) was not that women would be serving on Royal Navy submarines but that they were still being called [Wrens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Royal_Naval_Service).   Demonstrating my own ignorance, I thought that designation had been phased out sometime after World War II.  Indeed it was, but only seventeen years ago in 1993.   In the US in WWII, Navy [WAVES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAVES) (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) served only until the end of the war.

But returning to submarines, the women serving on Royal Navy submarines will  be provided with separate berthing and showering facilities.  The women will be hot bunking (or hot-bedding as the Brits would say) but only with other women aboard.   Does anyone know if smoking is still allowed on Royal Navy subs?  In the [US Navy smoking on subs will be banned](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/04/27/the-end-of-smoking-on-navy-submarines/) as of 2011.   By 2012 the [first 19 women will be assigned to US Navy four ballistic missile submarines](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/05/15/women-submariners-pioneers-facing-many-challenges/).

[Diving belles! Wrens set to serve on Navy submarines… and they’ll get their own bunks to avoid ‘hot-bedding’ with the men](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1335741/Wrens-serve-Navy-submarines-bunks-avoid-hot-bedding.html?ITO=1490)
