![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rclship.jpg)A 15-year-old girl was allegedly plied with liquor aboard a Royal Caribbean ship by a group of men, before being taken to a cabin and gang-raped. She was on a seven-day cruise with her two sisters and grandparents beginning the day after Christmas in 2015. She alleges that everything but the rape took place in full view of crew and security cameras, yet nobody intervened to prevent the men from buying alcohol for her or leading her away to the cabin.

She alleges that on the first night, in full view of Royal Caribbean crew, a group of men bought multiple alcoholic beverages for her at public bars until she became “highly intoxicated,” “obviously drunk, disoriented, and unstable,” and “obviously incapacitated.” That group of around a dozen men then took her to a cabin where they “brutally assaulted and gang-raped her according to the girl’s claim.

[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/cruise-ship-gang-rape-alcohol-minor-royal-caribbean-1451052) reports that a district court in Florida had dismissed the girl’s negligence lawsuit against Royal Caribbean over the 2015 incident for failure to state a claim, ruling that she had not sufficiently alleged the operator had breached its duty of care and proximately caused her injuries.  But that decision was reversed on Wednesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which concluded her claims were, in fact, sufficient to allege that Royal Caribbean was negligent towards her.

Is this an isolated case or is sexual assault on cruise ships a chronic problem? According to US government data, sex crimes aboard cruise ships far outweigh any other major offense on board.

[NBC reports](https://qz.com/1022245/why-cruise-ships-have-a-sexual-assault-problem/), of the 92 alleged on-board crimes reported by cruise lines in 2016, 62 were sexual assaults. When sexual assaults occur at sea, it may be hard for victims to get justice on land. Some assaults were barely investigated, according to the victims and families who spoke to NBC. Most were never prosecuted.  

[New Times](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/royal-caribbean-cruise-line-knew-of-sexual-assault-epidemic-on-its-ships-court-says-11227454) reports that as of April 2019, 220 sexual assaults on cruises had been reported to the U.S. Department of Transportation since 2016. There were 82 sexual assaults reported in 2018. And 52 people have reported being assaulted on Royal Caribbean cruises, specifically, in the past three years.

[Hanna Kozlowska](https://qz.com/1022245/why-cruise-ships-have-a-sexual-assault-problem/) writing in *Quartz* notes that the problem of sexual assault on cruise lines is a [long-running one](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/29/us/carnival-cruises-raises-its-tally-of-sexual-misconduct-reports.html). The industry and the government have been reporting some data on these crimes for years. Yet the American public has only had a more complete picture [since 2016](http://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/nation-now/2016/10/07/cruise-ship-crime-report/91706664/), after reporting standards were changed. These numbers are still likely smaller than in reality—sex crimes are generally under-reported, and what gets classified as an assault depends on the cruise line’s security officials. Experts point out that incidents are often miscategorized as lesser crimes.

In 1998, the New York Times published “[On Cruise Ships, Silence Shrouds Crimes.](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/111698cruise-ship-crime.html)” In discussing sex crimes on cruise ships they said that in every case, the accusers say, the cruise line’s main concern was to protect its reputation by buying or coercing their silence and shielding the accused.

At least in the case of the gang-raped 15-year-old, Royal Caribbean will have to answer accusations of negligence.  “The scope of Royal Caribbean’s duty to protect its passengers is informed, if not defined, by its knowledge of the dangers they face onboard. And it allegedly knew a lot,” reads [the ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/royal-caribbean-cruise-line-knew-of-sexual-assault-epidemic-on-its-ships-court-says-11227454) for the Eleventh Circuit.
