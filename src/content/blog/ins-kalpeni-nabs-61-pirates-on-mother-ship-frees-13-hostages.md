INS Kalpeni

Last Friday, the Indian Navy picked up as distress call from the container ship *[MV Vancouver Bridge](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?mmsi=356413000),* which was under attack by pirates  in the Indian Ocean, about 600 nautical miles off the Indian coast.  When spotted by an Indian patrol aircraft, the pirates broke off the attack and retreated to a “mother ship,”  the *[Vega 5](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-01/mozambican-fishing-vessel-vega-5-hijacked-by-pirates-eu-says.html)*, a fishing vessel hijacked on December 28, 2010.  On Saturday night, the Indian Navy’s newest fast attack craft, *[INS Kalpeni](http://www.hindu.com/2010/09/21/stories/2010092158190200.htm)*, intercepted the *Vega* and after a brief firefight  captured 61 pirates and freed the *Vega’*s crew of 13 who had been held as hostages since the ship had been hijacked.
