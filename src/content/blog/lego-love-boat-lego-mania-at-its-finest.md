Interior Bow of the LEGO "Love Boat"

A quarter of a million LEGO blocks!   That is what it took to build the model of the *Pacific Princess* “Love Boat”  in LEGOs. The model took six months to construct, is 10.5 feet long and 5 feet high.   It is the work of professional LEGO builder, Ryan McNaugh.   (I was unaware that LEGO building could be a profession.)   The model features both the interior and exterior of the ship.   Very impressive.  Click on the thumbnail for a larger image.
