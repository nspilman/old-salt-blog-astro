![adcover1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/adcover1.jpg)A great event on the [historic ex-Coast Guard Cutter *Lilac*](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/) at Pier 25 in Manhattan on Thursday, September 8th at 6PM. James M. Kendra and Tricia Wachtendorf will discuss and sign copies of their new book, *[American Dunkirk: The Waterborne Evacuation of Manhattan on 9/11](https://www.amazon.com/American-Dunkirk-Waterborne-Evacuation-Manhattan/dp/1439908214/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472940154&sr=8-1&keywords=american+dunkirk)*.  A panel discussion will follow.

From the [Lilac Preservation Project](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/) press release: One of the great untold stories of 9/11 is the impromptu response by mariners that resulted in the biggest evacuation by water in history.

The new book *American Dunkirk: The Waterborne Evacuation of Manhattan on 9/11* examines what lessons can be learned from the mobilization of boats and ships that rescued countless people following the attacks. The authors Tricia Wachtendorf and James Kendra will present a summary of their research and discuss it as part of a panel also featuring Jessica DuLong, chief engineer on the fireboat *John J. Harvey* and author of the forthcoming book *Calling All Boats: Untold Stories from the Maritime Evacuation of September 11th*, and Eddie Rosenstein, Executive Producer/Director at Eyepop Productions, producer of the film *Boatlift*. Captain Patrick Harris, owner and operator of the sailing yacht Ventura, a mariner who participated in the evacuation, will moderate the discussion.

A reception and book signing follows. Paperback copies of *American Dunkirk* will be available at a discounted price of $20.00. Cash only.

Boatlift will be screened and audio recordings of mariners’ reminiscences, courtesy of [PortSide NewYork](http://portsidenewyork.org/), will be available for listening during the reception.

Admission is free but space is limited. [Please register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/american-dunkirk-book-discussion-signing-tickets-27419255732).
