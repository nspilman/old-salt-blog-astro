![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/que2x.jpg)Since being sold by Cunard in 2007, the classic liner [Queen Elizabeth 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_2) has been the locus of many plans and schemes, all of which have come to naught.  Sadly, the ship has remained tied up at a dock in Dubai’s [Port Rashid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Rashid) for the last six years, where she is falling into disrepair.

Purchased by state-run conglomerate, [Dubai World](http://www.dubaiworld.ae/), for about $100 million, the ship was moved to Port Rashid in 2008 to be [converted to a 1,000 room luxury hotel](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/3525963/QE2-arrives-in-Dubai-at-end-of-final-journey.html). After the recession of 2008, Dubai World was staggering under a huge debt load and plans for the QE2 were put on hold. In mid 2012, Dubai announced a [more modest hotel plan for the ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/07/dubai-unveils-more-modest-plans-for-qe2-hotel/), reducing the number of rooms to 300.  By years end, these plans fell apart as well, and it was announced that the [ship was being sold for scrap](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/12/queen-elizabeth-2-sold-for-scrap-dubai-hotel-plans-fall-apart/). In early 2013, the Oceanic Group announced that the ship was not being taken for scrap but would be [converted to a luxury hotel in Asia.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/01/update-qe2-new-plan-announced-for-conversion-to-luxury-hotel-in-asia/)  A year later, these plans seem no closer to fruition than any of the others.

The only recent activity observed aboard the classic liner were [workmen in shorts and T-shirts cooking a pig](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2854836/Rotting-obscurity-workers-spitroasting-PIGS-deck-majesterial-QE2-suffers-languishes-Dubai-plan-turn-400-room-hotel.html) over a barbecue made from half an oil drum.
