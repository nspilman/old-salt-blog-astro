![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dq2x.jpg)Great news. The [Senate has passed a waiver](http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/apr/04/senate-oks-delta-queen-waiver-20170404/?f=news-arkansas) for the historic riverboat steamer [*Delta Queen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Queen) from the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) regulations, moving it one step closer to returning to service.

For several years now, [we have been posting about the struggle to restore the historic riverboat steamer](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/03/will-the-steamboat-delta-queen-sail-again/) *Delta Queen* and to return her to operation on the Mississippi and other inland rivers. The reported $5 million restoration of the 1927-built stern-wheel steamboat has been held up by the need for a Congressional SOLAS waiver. The *Delta Queen* operated with a series of two year waivers from 1966 through 2007. The waiver still needs to approved by the House of Representatives. A similar waiver was passed by the House in 2013, but blocked by the Senate.

The waiver is required because the deck house of the *Delta Queen* is built largely of wood which is not allowed under the structural fire protection regulations established by SOLAS. Supporters of the historic steamer note that the *Delta Queen* has operated safely for over 80 years, 40 of which were under Congressional waivers.
