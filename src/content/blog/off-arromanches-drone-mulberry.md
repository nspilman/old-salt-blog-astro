Here is a lovely drone video by François Monier of what is left of Mulberry B just offshore near the French village of Arromanches.

One of the reasons that the Germans were skeptical of an Allied invasion of Normandy was the lack of a nearby harbor through which to unload men and supplies. The Allies addressed the problem by building [Mulberry harbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulberry_harbour), two massive portable harbors which were fabricated in Britain in modules, towed across the Channel and then reassembled off the coast of Normandy shortly after D-Day, in 1944.  Mulberry A was assembled off Omaha Beach, while Mulberry B was installed off Gold Beach near the French village of Arromanches. During the eight months that it operated, the Mulberry off Arromanches was used to disembark two and a half million men, a half million vehicles, and four million tons of supplies.  To learn more, see our post from June 2016, [The Mulberries Battle the Storm — June 19, 1944](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/06/mulberries-battle-storm-1944/).
