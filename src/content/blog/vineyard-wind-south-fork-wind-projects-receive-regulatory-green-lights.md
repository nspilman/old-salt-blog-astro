### Vineyard Wind

[Vineyard Wind](https://www.vineyardwind.com/), an 800 megawatt (MW) wind farm to be built 15 miles off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, was advised that the [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) had completed its environmental review](https://www.boem.gov/vineyard-wind). The Final Environmental Impact Statement is the second to last step in the federal permitting process for the project. The Interior Department could greenlight the project as early as April.

“We want to thank BOEM for all of the work they’ve done since we submitted the permit application in December of 2017 on this first-in-the-nation project,” said Vineyard Wind CEO Lars T. Pedersen. “More than three years of federal review and public comment is nearing its conclusion and 2021 is poised to be a momentous year for our project and the broader offshore wind industry.”

The project, now expected to begin operation in 2023, will serve the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by providing clean electricity to power more than 400,000 homes, creating thousands of good-paying jobs, and reducing electricity rates by $1.4 billion over the first 20 years of operation. The project is also expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1.68 million metric tons annually, the equivalent of taking 325,000 cars off the road each year.

### South Fork Wind

The New York State Public Service Commission has unanimously voted to grant the [Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need](https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/wind/south-fork-wind-project-receives-critical-vote-20210319) for New York’s [South Fork Wind Farm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Fork_Wind_Farm)  The 130 MW project, to be located 35 miles off the coast of Montauk, New York, is expected to power  70,000 homes. The project is expected to begin operations in 2023.

Currently, the only offshore wind turbines in service off the United States are [five 6MW wind turbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98rsted_US_Offshore_Wind) off Block Island, Rhode Island.

Vineyard Wind plans to use 14 MW [GE Haliade X turbines](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/01/ges-mega-offshore-wind-turbine-when-bigger-may-be-better/), while South Fork Wind is expected to use 12 MW Haliade turbines. The GE Haliade turbines are currently the world’s largest wind turbines in production.
