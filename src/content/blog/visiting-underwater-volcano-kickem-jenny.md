Back in 2011, we posted about [Kick’em Jenny](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/kick-em-jenny-rocking-out-underwater/), which in addition to being the name of a rockabilly singer as well as a [Dutch Celtic Symfo-Folk group](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kick-em-Jenny/62139509979?v=info), is an active underwater volcano in the [Lesser Antilles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Antilles_Volcanic_Arc) about 5 miles north of the island of [Grenada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada).

Kick’em Jenny rises 4,265 ft above the sea floor on the steep inner western slope of the Lesser Antilles ridge.  The volcano has erupted on at least twelve occasions between 1939 and 2001.  The dome of the volcano is approximately 180 meters (590 feet) below the surface of the Caribbean.  Kick’em Jenny was last surveyed in 2003.  Last October, researchers sent an ROV into the volcano to see what had changed over the last decade.   The video below is a fascinating journey into the volcano, with commentary by Dr. Steve Carey, Chief Scientist on the [E/V](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EV_Nautilus) *[Nautilus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EV_Nautilus).*  For more videos of Kick-em-Jenny and other submarine wonders go to [Exploration Now](http://www.explorationnow.org/).
