![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sharkwarning.jpg)The bad news is that there have been three reported shark attacks off New York’s beaches in just over a week. The good news is that the injuries, so far, have been minor. Nevertheless, beaches in New York and along the Jersey Shore are on high alert, flying red flags near beach signs and purple flags in lifeguard areas to alert visitors of the potential danger.  Lifeguards are patrolling on paddle boards and jet skis, while overhead, helicopters and drones are helping to watch for sharks.

Last Thursday, a 17-year-old lifeguard was participating in a training exercise off Ocean Beach on Fire Island, when [he was bitten around the ankle](https://abc7ny.com/shark-attack-long-island-lifeguard-bitten-attacks-ocean-beach/12028972/). The injury required stitches but was not life-threatening. Officials with the Town of Islip say experts told them it was most likely a sand tiger shark about three to five feet in length.

Last Sunday, another lifeguard, also in a training exercise, was [bitten by a shark off Smith Point](https://abc7ny.com/shark-nip-beaches-reopen-lifeguard/12016604/) on Fire Island. 

“I felt pressure in my hand, pulled it back and I just started hammering, punching and I connected with the shark three times, and then on the third time it spun away,” Zachari Gallo said. “Blood was pouring down my hand and arm. I actually didn’t even realize I was nicked in my chest. I guess my adrenaline, survival instincts kicked in.”

He says the shark he encountered was between four and five feet long.

“Thankfully it was a minor situation and just grateful that I walked away with a minor, a minor injury,” Gallo said.

The previous Thursday, a 57-year-old man swimming off Jones Beach “sustained a laceration to his right foot,” Nassau County Police said in a statement. The wound was identified as a possible shark bite.

[The Gothamist](https://gothamist.com/news/another-lifeguard-attacked-by-shark-off-of-fire-island-officials-say) notes that despite the recent incidents, unprovoked shark attacks are still extremely rare. Last year, researchers confirmed 47 unprovoked shark attacks nationwide. Most of those attacks occurred in Florida, and surfers were often the victims.
