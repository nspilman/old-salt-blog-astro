USS Pittsburgh (SSN-720)

The American singer/songwriter, Paul Simon, had a hit in 1975 titled “*[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=298nld4Yfds)*.”  Sending an email to your mistress telling her that you are dead is definitely not on the list.  Commander Michael P. Ward II was recently relieved of command of the  Los Angeles-class submarine, [USS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Pittsburgh_\(SSN-720\)) *[Pittsburgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Pittsburgh_\(SSN-720\)),* after he attempted to end an affair with his mistress by faking his own death.   The submarine commander, who is married with children, attempted to end the affair by sending an e-mail from an apparently fake co-worker named “Bob”  telling the woman that Commander Ward had died unexpectedly.  When the woman showed up at Ward’s previous residence in Virginia to express her condolences, she was told that Ward was indeed alive and that he had just moved to Connecticut to take command of the USS *Pittsburgh.* Ward was found guilty of dereliction of duty, unbecoming conduct and adultery, and received the punitive letter of reprimand.
