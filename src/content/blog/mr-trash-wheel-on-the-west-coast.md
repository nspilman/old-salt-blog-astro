![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mrtrashwheel.jpg)Earlier this year, we posted about Baltimore’s “[Mr. Trash Wheel](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/02/baltimores-mr-trash-wheel-water-solar-powered-harbor-trash-gobbler/),” a water-wheel and solar powered conveyor system which lifts drifting trash from the water of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. Mr. Trash Wheel has been so successful that three other similar trash wheels have been installed around Baltimore harbor.  

Now, a similar water wheel will be installed on the West Coast at Newport Beach, California.  The Orange County Register reports that, on Thursday, Oct. 25, Newport Beach Mayor Duffy Duffield went to Santa Cruz and received a $1.7 million grant from the California Ocean Protection Council to fund the Newport Bay Water Wheel Project. Funding would pay for permits, construction, and installation of the wheel, which should be in place by 2020.

“We are very grateful that the Ocean Protection Council provided us with such a generous grant and are excited to bring our water wheel project to fruition,” Duffield said.
