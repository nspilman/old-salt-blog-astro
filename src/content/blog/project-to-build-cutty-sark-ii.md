![cs11](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cs11-125x125.jpg)A [group of tall ship enthusiasts](http://cutty-sark.org/) are attempting raise money to build and sail an exact replica of the great [composite clipper ship, *Cutty Sark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark).  The goal is to [launch the *Cutty Sark II*](http://cutty-sark.org/)  by November 2019, the 150th anniversary of the launching of the original ship. The group is led by [Vladimir Martus](http://cutty-sark.org/2015/10/31/vladimir-martus/), a naval architect previously involved in two large wooden replica sailing ship projects — the 80′ long schooner *St Peter*  in 1991 and the 110′  long Russian frigate *[Shtandart](http://www.shtandart.com/index.htm)* built in 1999. He also served as the captain of the *Shtandart.*   Vladimir Martus narrates the video about the project:

The original *Cutty Sark* was one of the last great clipper ships, built on the River Clyde in 1869.  The original is preserved as a museum ship in dry dock in Greenwich, UK.  (See our post from 2012 about the historic ship’s refurbishment  — [Cutty Sark – the Good, Bad & the Ugly](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/10/cutty-sark-the-good-bad-the-ugly/).)
