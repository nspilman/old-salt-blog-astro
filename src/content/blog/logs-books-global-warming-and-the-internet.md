![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/adm55_log108_page004.jpg)Last October, we wrote about how researchers are using eighteenth century Royal Navy ship logs to study climate change.  (See [Logbooks may yield climate bounty](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/10/10/logbooks-may-yield-climate-bounty/).)  Now, through the wonder of the internet, many of these log books are on-line.  The logs of over 100 ships are accessible, including  the *Beagle*, the  *Endeavour*, the *Resolution*, the *Pandora*, the *Bounty*, the *Royalist*, the *Terror* and the *Victory* among other notable ships.

The website hosting the logs is the [British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC)](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/home/), which is the Natural Environment Research Council’s (NERC) Designated Data Centre for the Atmospheric Sciences.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for the reference.
