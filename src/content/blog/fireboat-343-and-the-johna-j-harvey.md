![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/343.jpg)When the new [New York City fireboat *343*](http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/General+News/55882/FDNY+Gets+Worlds+Largest+Fireboat+On+Friday.html) arrived in New York harbor yesterday, one of the fleet greeting her was the [fireboat](http://www.fireboat.org/index.asp) *[John J. Harvey](http://www.fireboat.org/index.asp)*.  (Will has some great photos and commentary the [tugster](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/the-343/) blog.)   I am struck by the parallels between the two boats.  
  
The *John J. Harvey* was named for a fireboat pilot who died in an a explosion while fighting a fire on the German Lloyd Lines ship *Muenchen* at North River Pier 42 in 1930.  The fireboat *343* is named in honor of the firefighters lost in the collapse of the World Trade Center on 9/11/01.    The *John J. Harvey* was the largest and most powerful fireboat in the world when built, a honor that can now be claimed by the *343*.    Both boats will also forever be tied the events of 9/11.  The *John J. Harve*y, though retired as a City of New York fireboat, was the first fireboat on scene at the World trade Center on 9/11.  Because water main onshore had been destroyed, the *John J. Harve*y pumped water ashore to firefighters on scene.  She  pumped non-stop for four days.
