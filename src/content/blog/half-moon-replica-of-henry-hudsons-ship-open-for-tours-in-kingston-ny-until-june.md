*It’ll be open to the public from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day, including Memorial Day, for a $10 admission charge that also gets you into the museum. (See www.hrmm.org for more details.)*

*“It’s like going into a time machine,” said Capt. Chip Reynolds, who commands the ship’s volunteer crew of 24.*
