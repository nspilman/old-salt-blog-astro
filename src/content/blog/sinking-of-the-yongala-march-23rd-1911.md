![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/03/SS-Yongala-off-coast-of-Ayr.jpg)Today is the 100th anniversary of the tragic sinking of the passenger ship *[SS Yongala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Yongala)* in a cyclone off Australia with the loss of 122 lives.

[Yongala Centenary Expedition](http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2011/03/22/155335_local-news.html)

*CAIRNS tourism pioneer Charles Woodward is today heading for the shipwreck that claimed the life of his great grandmother Mary – and all her fellow passengers – exactly a century ago.*

*100 years ago tomorrow, the passenger cruiser SS Yongala was approaching Mackay on route from Melbourne to Cairns on its 99th voyage in Australian waters.*

*On March 23, 1911, disaster struck. The Yongala steamed into a cyclone and sank south of Townsville with the loss of all 122 people on board.*

*Tragically, a Marconi wireless that would have alerted the Yongala to the cyclone arrived from England shortly after the disaster.*

*To commemorate this tragic event, Woodward has chartered the M.V Sea Esta to visit the Yongala on the anniversary.*
