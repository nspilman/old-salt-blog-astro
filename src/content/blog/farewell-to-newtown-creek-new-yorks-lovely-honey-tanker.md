The *Newtown Creek* was recently sold at auction. At 324′ long and 49.6′ wide, she is a lovely coastal tanker that traversed New York harbor’s waters for close to a half century.  For a vessel of her size and type, I always found the *Newtown Creek* to be particularly attractive.  With relatively fine lines, a sharp bow, and a grey hull with rub rails that made the ship seem longer and sleeker than she was, it was perhaps even more pleasing that her appearance didn’t give away her job, which was carrying sewage sludge from various points around the harbor. Many of us, however, did not call her a sewage tanker or even a sludge tanker, but preferred the more delicate term “honey tanker.”  The name is adapted from the US Army trucks that used to empty latrines. The trucks were called sarcastically, “[honey wagons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywagon).” So, calling the *Newtown Creek* a “honey tanker” seemed to fit, both for her cargo and because, at least to some eyes, she was a sweet little ship.

Sludge is the residual organic material left after sewage and wastewater is treated. Up until 1992, New York City dumped the sewage sludge into the ocean. Since then the sludge has been converted to fertilizer pellets after being dewatered.  The *Newtown Creek* used to transport 1.2 million gallons of sludge per day, seven days a week. As reported in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/nyregion/for-sale-aging-boat-that-had-an-unenviable-job.html?_r=0): *On a typical day, in its later years, it would load sludge from the Owl’s Head treatment plant, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and take it to the Port Richmond plant on Staten Island. Then it would take another load from the North River plant in West Harlem to the Wards Island plant. Its gray hulls may have dings and scrapes and dents, but its tall cylindrical stacks still stand tall, after serving decades as exhaust methane vents for the sludge tanks.* 

[The tanker sold for $235,000.](http://www.publicsurplus.com/sms/nycdcas,ny/auction/view?auc=1327532) The two rumored bidders were a scrap dealer from Maryland and a town in Florida with plans to sink the ship offshore as an artificial reef.
