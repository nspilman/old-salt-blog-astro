![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dutchsail.jpg)The Netherlands has the largest, still operational, historical sailing fleet in the world, consisting of 400 traditional, authentic sailing vessels. There are real concerns that the historic fleet may be destroyed by the aftermath of COVID-19. With the fleet locked down in port, a significant component of the Netherlands’ maritime heritage is at risk. 

The [Maritime Post](https://themaritimepost.com/2020/05/25/dutch-historical-sailing-fleet-is-seeking-public-support-with-an-online-petition/#:~:text=The%20Netherlands%20has%20the%20largest,her%20cultural%20and%20historical%20value.) reports: *Due to the corona measures being taken in the Netherlands and worldwide the fleet is being threatened with becoming extinct. The owners are facing a revenue loss of up to 90% to 100% in 2020 and the outlook for 2021 is hardly any better. Without further financial support from the government, many businesses will face bankruptcy, which could result in the disappearance of these historical ships from the Dutch and international waters.*

In contrast to historical sailing ships in neighboring countries, Dutch historical sailing passenger ships are not subsidized by the government. They are commercially operated by their owners.

The new requirements of social distancing to slow the spread of the virus, effectively make sailing the traditional craft impossible. 

[Sven Timmann](https://www.facebook.com/sven.timmann), owner of the *Ambiance* – a 112-year-old three-masted schooner told the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/15/sinking-dutchman-worlds-largest-historical-sailing-fleet-threatened-by-covid-19?utm_term=RWRpdG9yaWFsX0d1YXJkaWFuVG9kYXlVUy0yMDA3MTU%3D&utm_source=esp&utm_medium=Email&CMP=GTUS_email&utm_campaign=GuardianTodayUS&fbclid=IwAR0HKirv5D6WMCSMFcVVgpPfzUMrnbuSXaTDQJiLDNHGArPiWwvZwlrA02Y),  “We need five people pulling on one rope to hoist a sail. This cannot be done alone.” In the cabins below deck, it is also impossible to maintain the minimum distances.

Certificates for historical vessels must be renewed every five years, at a cost of thousands of euros. If a certificate expires, the ship must be rebuilt to modern standards – a prohibitive investment for the owners.

Then there is the problem of maintenance. Paul van Ommen, director of the shipowner association BBZ, notes that “A day of sailing means two days of upkeep.” Half of a skipper’s annual income goes to maintenance. The longer the fleet sits idle, the fewer resources are available for necessary repairs and upkeep.  According to the BBZ, the fleet needs €20m just to stay afloat into the new year.

To raise awareness in an attempt to save the Dutch historical fleet, the skippers and owners have started an online petition to [Save the Hollandsche Sail Fleet](https://reddezeilvloot.petities.nl/?locale=nl).
