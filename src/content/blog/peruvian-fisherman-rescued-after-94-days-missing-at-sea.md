![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/03/peruvianfishermanrescue.jpg)A remarkable story of survival against all odds. [A Peruvian fisherman was found alive](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fisherman-found-alive-90-days-at-sea-peru-ate-turtles/) after drifting at sea for 94 days, a navy official said.  Maximo Napa, 61, was rescued in his small fishing boat on Tuesday after being spotted by an Ecuadoran vessel off the coast of Chimbote in northern Peru.

In a tearful interview, he told local media that he had survived at sea by eating cockroaches, birds, and turtles.

“Mr. Napa arrived in good physical condition. He could walk, and wash himself. Shocked, but in good physical condition,” said Peruvian Navy port captain Jorge Gonzalez.  Napa was discharged from the hospital on Saturday.

Maximo Napa set off on a fishing trip from the port of San Juan de Marcona, on the southern Peruvian coast, on December 7. He packed food for a two-week trip but 10 days in, stormy weather threw his boat off course and he ended up adrift. 

“It is a miracle that my father has been found,” his daughter Ines Napa told the [RPP radio station.](https://rpp.pe/peru/actualidad/maximo-napa-castor-dan-de-alta-al-pescador-que-reaparecio-luego-de-95-dias-perdido-en-altamar-noticia-1622100) “We, as a family, never gave up hope of finding him.”
