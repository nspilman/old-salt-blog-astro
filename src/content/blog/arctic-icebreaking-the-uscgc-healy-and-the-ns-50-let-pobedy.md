Also recently in the news, the Russian nuclear powered, [NS 50 Let Pobedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS_50_Years_Since_Victory), is not only the world’s largest icebreaker but also had an enlarged accommodations deck for tourists.  The nuclear powered ship regularly take tourists to the North Pole.   The video below shows some remarkable icebreaking as well as providing commentary on Russia’s checkered history of nuclear waste dumping in Arctic waters. The ship’s name means “50 Years Since Victory.”
