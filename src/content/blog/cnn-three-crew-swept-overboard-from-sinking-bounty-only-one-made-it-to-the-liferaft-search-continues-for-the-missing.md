I just heard an interview on CNN with a US Coast Guard Vice Admiral (I believe it was Vice Adm. Robert Parker, but I didn’t quite catch the name.)   He said that three crew members were swept off the deck of HMS *Bounty* as she sank. All three crew were wearing survival suits. One of the three made it to the life raft.  The other two did not.   The Coast Guard continues searching. Nevertheless, the Vice Admiral noted how difficult it is to locate a person in the high winds and seas in the area where the ship sank.
