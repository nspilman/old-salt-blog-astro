We have previously posted about how [the European drought has lowered the Rhine River](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/26/bombs-along-the-rhine-drought-exposing-wwii-unexploded-munitions/) so that World War II munitions long buried in the riverbank have become exposed.  [Over the weekend, forty five thousand people, roughly half of the population of the city of Koblentz, Germany,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/01/update-bombs-along-the-rhine-half-of-koblentz-evacuated/) at the junction of the Rhine and Moselle Rivers, were evacuated in order to defuse bombs exposed by falling river levels. Initially, it was reported that one British 4,000 pound bomb would be defused. Now, it appears that that bomb, as well as a smaller American high explosive bomb were both defused.   A third non-explosive device was also destroyed, according to the Koblenz fire department.
