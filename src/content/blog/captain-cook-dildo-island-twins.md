![captaindildo](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/captaindildo.jpg)The New York Times recently featured an article, “*[Proud to Live in a Town Called Dildo](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/world/what-in-the-world/proud-to-live-in-a-town-called-dildo.html?_r=0)*” about a Newfoundland fishing village with an odd name. The name was first applied to nearby [Dildo Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dildo,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador) and apparently dates to at least 1711, when it was spelled “Dildoe.”  No one knows the origin of the name, but odds are that the island was not named after a sex toy. One common theory is that “dildoe” was a variation on somewhat phallic shaped “thole-pin” or “dole-pin,” single or double pegs in the gunnel of a dinghy or skiff, used as oarlocks when rowing. In addition to the town and the island, there is also the Dildo Arm of Trinity Bay and a point named Dildo Head.

The town locals, called Dildoians, have an annual waterfront festival, [Dildo Days](https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g644375-i32986258-Dildo_Newfoundland_Newfoundland_and_Labrador.html). This year it will be on July 27-31. According to the reporting in the NY Times, “*a flotilla of boats circles the bay, led by a wooden statue of a certain Capt. Dildo in a rain slicker painted bright yellow. Souvenir-hunting visitors can purchase commemorative apparel, but be forewarned: The “I Survived Dildo Days” T-shirts sell out fast.*”  Fortunately, the wooden carving of Captain Dildo is of a fisherman with a white beard, smoking a pipe, bears no resemblance to a sex toy.

Newfoundland has its share of unusual names, at least some of which may be attributable to [Captain James Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook#Conquest_of_Canada_.281758.E2.80.9363.29). Before he sailed off on his epic voyages to the Pacific, he spent five seasons surveying the Newfoundland and Labrador coasts in the 1760s aboard HMS *Grenville*. On August 25, 1766, he came across two islands on the northern coast between Point Ferolle and the Bay of Islands. [Whimsically, he named the islands “Our Ladies Bubies.”](https://books.google.com/books?id=mIk8x6lsusQC&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=captain+cook+our+ladies+bubies&source=bl&ots=wTjUQt-iRD&sig=pPwLzuIkl2vsen-5i7KQ8PYnwB0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7wpTRy9rNAhUE1oMKHVQeDLgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=captain%20cook%20our%20ladies%20bubies&f=false)  The name also reflected his imagination as the two islands do not appear particularly mammarian.  Sadly, when the islands were engraved on the official chart they were designated as “[The Twins](http://www.earth-3d.com/?eid=6171020_CA_TISLS_05&title=Twin-Islands-Canada).”
