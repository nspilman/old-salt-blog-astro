It looked like a tsunami rolling in from the Atlantic toward the beach at Sea Girt on the Jersey Shore.  Except that it wasn’t rolling in. It just hung there.  It wasn’t a tsunami. It was merely a beautiful if somewhat threatening fog bank.  The National Weather Service later released their own explanation of the fog.
