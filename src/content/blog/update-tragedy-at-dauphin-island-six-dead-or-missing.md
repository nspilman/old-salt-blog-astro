A week ago, [tragedy struck at the Dauphin Island Regatta](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/04/tragedy-on-mobile-bay-2-dead-and-5-missing-in-dauphin-island-regatta/) on Mobile Bay,  when a powerful squall packing winds of almost 70 knots struck the assembled fleet. Six sailors were lost. The [bodies of five sailors have been found](http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2015/05/01/dauphin-island-race-two-more-bodies-recovered/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook).   The Coast Guard has now suspended the search for the sixth sailor who is still missing and presumed dead. Officials said the Coast Guard has spent more than 180 hours searching more than 9,527 miles of water and 164 miles of shoreline.

[The Coast Guard and the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency](http://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/2015/04/30/authorities-investigating-regatta-tragedy/26642347/) are conducting a joint investigation into the circumstances surrounding the events in Mobile Bay on Saturday during the Dauphin Island Regatta.
