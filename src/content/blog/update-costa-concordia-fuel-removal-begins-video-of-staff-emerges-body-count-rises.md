Pumping is expected to begin Saturday.

A [disturbing video has emerged](http://youtu.be/J5UcFcMhGVk) showing  a member of the ship’s staff directing passengers in life jackets to return to their staterooms. A women says that she as an “*announcement from our captain*.” She then says, “*We kindly ask that you return to your cabins or if you prefer you can stay in the lounges*.”  She goes on to say, “*We have finished addressing the  problem that we’ve had. The electrical problem with the generator. Everything is fine*.”  She then asks again for passengers to return to their cabins. The video ends with her saying, “*Everything is fine. OK?*”

The [body count has risen to 16](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/divers-crane-place-italy-ship-fuel-pumping-15426806#.Tx76XG-wyuw), as another body was found this morning. Twenty three people are still missing.
