The US Coast Guard has identified Guillermo Gonzales Losada, 49, as the man found dead in a debris field of parts of a boat, ten life jackets, flares and an oily sheen in the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday, off the coast of Florida, about 22 miles east of the entrance to the St. Johns River. The man was identified through his Venezuelan passport. His last known address was in Miami.  The Coast Guard says that it had not received reports of a missing boat.   Coast Guard boats and planes are searching the area for potential survivors. Thanks to Bob McKane for passing along the news.
