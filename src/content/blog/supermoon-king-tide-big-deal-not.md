Not so big a difference –supermoon vs normal full moon

The media has been full of stories about tonight’s “[supermoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon),” which is the largest in 68 years. Supermoon is the popular term for what astronomers call a moon [perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis)–[syzygy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_\(astronomy\)). This means that the moon is at its closest point to earth in its elliptical orbit and that the earth, moon, and sun are in alignment, resulting in a full moon. The last time the moon was this close to the earth was in 1948, and the next comparable supermoon will be in 2032.

Also associated with the supermoon is the so-called “[king tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_tide).” Tides normally vary with the phase of the moon, being higher or lower on days where the moon is full or there is a new moon. The king tide associated with a supermoon, called a [perigean spring tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perigean_spring_tide), is generally a few inches higher than a normal spring tide.

Is the supermoon a big deal? Opinions vary widely.

The supermoon is about 15% larger and about 16% brighter than the average full moon, which may or may not be noticeable to the average observer. Hayden Planetarium director Neil deGrasse Tyson commented, “if you have a 16 inch pizza, would you call that a super pizza compared with a 15 inch pizza?”

Likewise, the king tide is typically only a few inches higher than a normal spring tide. Typically, tides can vary by a few inches above or below the expected heights due to storms and wind direction. In those low-lying areas where the king tides cause flooding, the real culprit may be rising sea-levels more than the tides.

If you are on the East Coast of the United States, and you want to see the supermoon tonight, you may be out of luck when you step outside. Much of the East Coast sky is expected to be obscured by cloud cover this evening. If you really want to see the supermoon, however, you can catch it [on-line here.](http://www.space.com/34712-closest-supermoon-full-moon-since-1948-webcasts.html)
