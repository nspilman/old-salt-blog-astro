Mark & Scott Kelley

In January 2011, [we posted about Mark and Scott Kelly](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/the-kelly-brothers-starship-sailors/), two “starship sailors” — identical twin brothers who both graduated from merchant marine academies and went on to be astronauts in the US space program. Now, [Scott Kelly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Kelly_\(astronaut\)) is about to embark on a marathon, [year long voyage on the International Space Station](http://www.space.com/28909-one-year-space-mission-scott-kelly.html), while his brother Mark will remain on the ground, yet will still play an important role in the mission.

Identical twins, Mark and Scott were raised in New Jersey and both attended merchant marine academies. Mark graduated from [United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point,](http://www.usmma.edu/) NY, while Scott is a graduate of the State University of [New York Maritime College at Fort Schuyler](http://www.sunymaritime.edu/), only a few miles across Long Island Sound from Kings Point. Both served as naval aviators and then became astronauts.  They are the only siblings and the only twins to ever have flow in space.

Mark Kelley piloted the Space Shuttle in 2001 on STS-108. He piloted STS-121 in 2006 and commanded STS-124 in 2008 and STS-134 in 2011. STS-134 was his final mission and the final mission of Space Shuttle Endeavour.  Mark Kelley is the husband of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and resigned from the Navy in 2011.

Scott Kelley flew as pilot of Space Shuttle Discovery during STS-103 in 1999 and as mission commander of STS-118. Kelly was commander of the International Space Station (ISS) Expedition 26. On Friday, he is scheduled to embark on a year long mission on the International Space Station. The mission will be the first time an American has spent a continuous year in space.

While his brother Scott is in space, Mark Kelley will be living on the ground. Nevertheless, he is still playing a significant part in the mission. When Scott returns from his year long journey, his physical condition will be assessed  and compared to Mark’s to help determine what effect long-term weightlessness and living in space has on the human body. Never before have doctors had a twin brother to use as a control subject in judging an astronaut’s condition.
