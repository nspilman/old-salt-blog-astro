![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amcup35.jpg)After being [postponed for two days](https://www.americascup.com/en/news/2577_Americas-Cup-Opening-Day-postponed-until-Saturday-27th-May.html) by high winds, the [35th America’s Cup](https://www.americascup.com/en/home.html) is scheduled to start this morning. Many consider the races to be the greatest show on the water — a thrilling, high-stakes extravaganza featuring cutting-edge technology and the best sailors in the sport. Others view the races as an ego-fueled billionaire’s extravagance featuring obscenely costly beach-cats, wholly unrelated the rest of the world of sailing. There may be elements of truth in both viewpoints.

The races have certainly changed from the more stately America’s Cups of old, before the competing sailors started wearing crash helmets as part of their uniforms. The 35th competition is a continuation and refinement of the “foiling revolution” introduced in the last running of the races. The 50′ catamarans in this year’s race are among the most advanced sailing vessels ever seen and can sail at 45 knots in a 15-knot breeze, and up to 30 knots upwind.

In addition to the fourteen or so sailors on each of the AC50s, there are many times more support staff — managers, boat-builders, engineers, hydrodynamicists, logisticians, riggers, and sailmakers. The effort looks more like mission control at a moon launch than a traditional sailboat race. The technology is still evolving. Recently Jimmy Spithill, the captain of [Oracle Team USA](http://oracle-team-usa.americascup.com/), was quoted as saying, “We’re still on the steep side of the development slope.” The jargon has shifted from nautical to Silicone Valley. 

But, are all these changes necessarily good? Pat Reynolds writing in the American Sailing Association blog raises the question, “[Is the America’s Cup Good for the Sport of Sailing?](https://asa.com/news/2017/04/18/americas-cup-good-for-sport-of-sailing/)” Commenting on the dizzying rate of change, Reynolds writes: 

*So where does that leave us – the sailing fan? Perhaps not in a place we once called home. We no longer look at the America’s Cup boats as gorgeous designs with cutting edge innovations that will one day trickle down to the very boat we sail. We can no longer look at the racing to watch and take notes, applying what we see to our own local habits. Case and point: One of this year’s AC boats actually has a crewman assigned to a power-generating stationary bicycle. The contemporary America’s Cup is a different beast.*

The changes are also clearly apparent to those sailing the foiling cats. [Christian Kamp, trimmer from the Swedish sailing team Artemis Racing](http://emag.nauticexpo.com/article-long/6477/) commented recently:

*“When it comes to the sailing itself, I must say that this America’s Cup is very different from the previous ones I’ve been involved in. The foiling revolution has changed so much, and not all of it for the better. Most of what we do now is deliver power to the hydraulic systems that run the foils and the wing. We’ve been reduced to grinders, and there is not a lot of trimming any more, in the traditional sense.*

*“Computers are running everything. Software is actually one of the prime parameters and will be a very decisive factor when racing starts in May. I feel like it’s a lot of waste to have all these great sailors here, more or less reduced to hamsters on a spinning wheel. But that’s the direction things are going.*
