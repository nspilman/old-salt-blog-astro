![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/volvoleg2.jpg)On the first leg of the [Volvo Ocean Race](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/home.html), [half the fleet traveled to Cape Town on the deck of cargo ships](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/22/puma-yacht-mar-mostro-dismasted-half-of-volvo-fleet-out-of-race/) following rigging or hull failures. Now in the second leg of the race, the entire fleet was loaded onboard an armed cargo ship on the day after Christmas at a “secret safe haven port in the Indian Ocean.” They will be carried to Sharjah, roughly 80 miles from Abu Dhabi, in order to restart the second leg on January 4th. This rather extraordinary step was taken to avoid the risk of pirate attacks in the Indian Ocean.
