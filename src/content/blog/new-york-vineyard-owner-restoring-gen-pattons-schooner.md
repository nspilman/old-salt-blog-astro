[![wandi1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/10/wandi1.jpg)Back in 2010, we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/10/pattons-schooner-when-and-if-to-be-sold/) that “[*When and If*](https://www.facebook.com/schoonerwhenandif)“, a 1939 Alden schooner built for General George Patton, was for sale, as a result of the then current owner’s divorce. The 63’5” schooner was named “*When and If*” because Patton said that he planned on sailing the world in the schooner, “when the war was over and if I survive.” Ironically, Patton survived the war but died in a traffic accident just as the fighting ended.

The schooner was sold but soon was caught up in bankruptcy proceedings. Recently, New York vineyard owner, Doug Hazlitt, purchased the schooner and is having her rebuilt at Cayuga Wooden Boatworks at the north end of Cayuga Lake. You can follow her restoration on the [yacht’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/schoonerwhenandif).
