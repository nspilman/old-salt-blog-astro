Woodwind – Fastest Overall

In our previous post about the [Great Chesapeake Schooner Race](http://www.schoonerrace.org/results12.htm) we focused on the Class AA schooners, the big boats over 50′. Big boats sail faster, right? Not necessarily.  (Thanks to Paul Caroll for pointing out our oversight.)

This year, the Class A schooners dominated the race. While the *[Summerwind](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Schooner-Summerwind/333891745040)* did indeed take the Class AA honors, the Class A schooner *[Woodwind](http://www.schoonerwoodwind.com/)* won the race both on elapsed and corrected time. *Woodwind* cross the line almost 2 hours ahead of the next fastest boat, [*Heron*](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Schooner-Heron-Charters/203632606316106) and over three hours ahead of the first Class AA boat, *Summerwind*. We offer our belated congratulations to the owners, captain and crew of the *Woodwind*. A remarkable showing.

This was indeed the year for the Class A schooners. The top three Class A schooners racing; *Woodwind*, *Heron* and *Prom Queen*; all beat the elapsed time of the Class AA schooner *Summerwind* and the rest of the Class AA fleet.  [For detailed race results, click here](http://www.schoonerrace.org/pdfs/results12.pdf).
