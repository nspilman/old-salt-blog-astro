![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ghwbushbanner.jpg)Regardless of what one may think of the political career of the late President [George H.W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush) , who died recently at the age of 94, it seems worthwhile to remember his service as one of the youngest pilots in the US Navy during World War II, service for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism under fire. 

When he heard of the attack on Pearl Harbor, George H.W. Bush, a student at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, decided that he wanted to be a Navy pilot.  Immediately after graduation, on his 18th birthday, [George Bush enlisted in the Navy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/12/01/george-hw-bush-pearl-harbor-changed-everything-world-war-ii-made-him-hero/?utm_term=.0168536ec8b4) and began preflight training at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After completing the 10-month course, he was commissioned as an ensign in the US Naval Reserve on 9 June 1943, several days before his 19th birthday, making him one of the youngest naval aviators.  

Ensign and then LTJG George Bush would go on to fly 58 combat missions as part of Torpedo Squadron (VT-51), Air Group 51, based on the carrier [USS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_San_Jacinto_\(CVL-30\)) *San Jacinto.*  In 1944, his squadron suffered a 300 percent casualty rate among its pilots. Bush survived winning three Air Medals as well as a Presidential Unit Citation. 

In September of 1944, Bush’s squadron was conducting a [bombing mission on a Japanese installation on the island of Chi Chi Jima](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/navy-aviator-george-h-w-bush-and-his-squadron-attacked) in the Pacific when they encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire. The engine on Bush’s plane was set ablaze, yet Bush managed to release his bombs and head back toward the aircraft carrier San Jacinto before bailing out over the water. Three other crew members perished in the attack. After floating on a raft for four hours, a submarine crew fished a safe but exhausted Bush out of the water. His bravery in action earned him a Distinguished Flying Cross. 

The [USS *George H.W. Bush*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_George_H.W._Bush), the tenth and final Nimitz-class supercarrier of the United States Navy, was named in honor of the 41st president.  

President George H.W. Bush was known in later years for wearing colorful socks. He will be carried to his final resting place wearing [a pair of socks honoring his service as a Navy pilot](https://www.today.com/news/george-h-w-bush-be-laid-rest-wearing-socks-honoring-t144293) in World War II.
