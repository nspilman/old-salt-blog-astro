![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/04/ussamerica.jpg)The UK Daily Mail’s headline, as shown on Google, read “[USS *America* aircraft carrier steams to intercept Chinese ships…”](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8238899/USS-America-aircraft-carrier-steams-intercept-Chinese-ships-disputed-waters-near-Malaysia.html)

The story behind the headline is that the [*USS America*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_America_\(LHA-6\)) and the guided-missile destroyer [USS *Bun**ker Hill*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bunker_Hill_\(CG-52\)) are being deployed to intercept a Chinese government survey ship and several Chinese Coast Guard vessels in a contested stretch of the South China Sea near Malaysia. US officials have accused China of taking advantage of the distraction posed by the coronavirus outbreak to increase its maritime presence in the region. The deployment of the USS *America* Expeditionary Strike Group is intended as a show of force.

Despite the Google headline, the USS *America* is not, at least according to the US Navy, an aircraft carrier. She is a [Landing Helicopter Assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_helicopter_assault) ship (LHA). Nevertheless, she has a flight deck and can launch and land jet fighters, as well as tiltrotor aircraft and a variety of types of helicopters. In addition to her operating crew of just over a thousand, she can also carry an expeditionary unit of 1,871 Marines.

With the Nimitz class carrier, [USS *Theodore Roosevelt* tied up in Guam](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/04/first-sailor-from-uss-theodore-roosevelt-dies-from-coronavirus/) attempting to cope with an outbreak of the coronavirus, USS *America* is the most powerful US naval vessel available in the Pacific. 

The USS *America* is almost a carrier. She is the same size as the French aircraft carrier *Charles De Gaulle* and India’s *INS Vikramaditya*, although a bit smaller than the RFS *Admiral Kuzetsov* or her Chinese sister, the *Liaoning*. *America* is considerably larger than recent aircraft-carrying ships constructed for the Korean, Japanese, and Australian navies. In most navies around the world, USS *America* would be considered to be an aircraft carrier in her own right. 

To be fair, despite the Google headline, the Daily Mail article distinguishes between an aircraft carrier and a helicopter assault ship. That being said, whether helicopter carriers should be counted as aircraft carriers has been [the topic of some discussion](https://thediplomat.com/2014/04/does-the-us-navy-have-10-or-19-aircraft-carriers/). While the US Navy considers only the 10 Nimitz class ships and the USS *Gerald Ford* to be carriers, [other sources include the 9 US helicopter assault ships](https://www.globalfirepower.com/navy-aircraft-carriers.asp) as carriers in order to fairly compare their capabilities to other national navies around the world.  

Whatever her designation may be, the USS *America* is a formidable ship.
