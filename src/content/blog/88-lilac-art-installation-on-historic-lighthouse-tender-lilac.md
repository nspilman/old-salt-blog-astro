Happy [Coast Guard Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_Guard_Day)! In honor of the day, a post about the former Coast Guard lighthouse tender, [USCGC *Lilac*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Lilac_\(WAGL-227\)), a museum ship located on the Hudson River in New York City. The *Lilac* is America’s only surviving steam-powered lighthouse tender.

At the end of May, we posted “[Celebrating Lighthouse Tender Lilac’s 88th Birthday in Audio and Visual Arts](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/05/celebrating-lighthouse-tender-lilacs-88th-birthday-in-audio-and-visual-arts/)” about a temporary public art installation on the historic ship.  Here is a follow-on video describing [88 Lilac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtEMWZMANi8), the two-part installation, as well as providing a tour and summary of the history of the lighthouse and buoy tender.

The *Lilac* has now reopened for tours at Pier 25 in lower Manhattan. [Click here to learn more](https://www.facebook.com/159428017428876/posts/4322717821099854/?sfnsn=mo).
