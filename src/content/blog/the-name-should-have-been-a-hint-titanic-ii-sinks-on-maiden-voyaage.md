Who in their right mind would name a boat *Titanic II* in the first place?   Fortunately there was no loss of life.   Prophetically enough, there is already a movie, [Titanic II](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1640571/).  It sank at the box office over a year before the cabin cruiser.

*When Mark Wilkinson took ownership of a cabin cruiser called Titanic II, perhaps he should have realised the omens were not good.*

*When he took his new 16ft boat out for its maiden voyage, it lived up to its namesake, and sank.   Mr Wilkinson was left floundering as the vessel sprang a leak and began taking on water before disappearing beneath the waves. Holidaymakers looked on while Mr Wilkinson, from Birmingham, was pulled out of the sea by the local harbour master.*

*Titanic II was was later towed out of West Bay harbour in Dorset.  Mr Wilkinson, aged in his 40s, said afterwards: “If it wasn’t for the harbour master I would have gone down with the Titanic. “It’s all a bit embarrassing and I got pretty fed up with people asking me if I had hit an iceberg.”*

Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for passing on this tale of woe.
