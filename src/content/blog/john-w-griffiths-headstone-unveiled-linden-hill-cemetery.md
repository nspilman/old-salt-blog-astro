![griffithdtombstone](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/griffithdtombstone.jpg)Yesterday, one hundred and thirty four year after his death, a headstone was unveiled at the grave of [John Willis Griffiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Griffiths), a gifted American naval architect who is often referred to as the “Father of the Clipper Ship.”  Although Griffiths was a brilliant engineer, designer, writer, editor and publisher; he died poor and was buried in an unmarked grave in the Linden Hill United Methodist Cemetery in Queens, NY.  The effort to provide a headstone for Griffith’s grave was spearheaded by Matt Carmel and Melbourne Smith with the sponsorship of the [National Maritime Historical Society](http://www.seahistory.org/), assisted by Dr. Larrie D. Ferreiro and Adam Brodsky of the New York Post.  Bruce Johnson, yacht designer and Director of Business Development  for the ‎Brooklin Boat Yard, Front Street Shipyard & Rockport Marine, provided major financial support for the project.

The headstone was designed by Melbourne Smith and is of black marble with a profile of the design considered to be Griffith’s masterpiece, the clipper ship [*Sea Witch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Witch_\(clipper\)). Below John Willis Griffiths name, profession and dates is a quote from his fellow designer and shipbuilder, [Donald McKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_McKay). It reads, “*You are a Master of your Profession, have no Superior in it.*”
