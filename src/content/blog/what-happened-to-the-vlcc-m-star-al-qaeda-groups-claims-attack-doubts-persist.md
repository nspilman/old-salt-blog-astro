![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mstar2.jpg)Over the last week, there have been no shortage of theories and often contradictory claims about what caused the damage to the hull and deck house of the MOL tanker *M. Star* while transiting the Straits of Hormuz.   The initial suggestion by a port official in the United Arab Emirates that the [](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-10786215)[ship was hit by a freak wave](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-10786215) has been largely discounted.    Likewise the claim by an Iranian marine authority that the explosion was do [“tank overheating”](http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=136931&sectionid=351020205), does not appear consistent with the damage to the ship.  Other theories have included a collision, possibly with a submarine, a grenade and sea mine.  Recently there has been speculation that the damage was caused by a waterborne improvised explosive device.

Recently, [Abdullah Azzam Brigades, a group associated with Al Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for an attack on  the ship](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6730IB20100804).   Some analysts have expressed skepticism as the group has made questionable claims in the past.   The investigation continues.
