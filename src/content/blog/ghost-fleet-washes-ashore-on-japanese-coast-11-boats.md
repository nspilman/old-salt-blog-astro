![ghostship](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/11/ghostship.jpg)In the last two months, [eleven wooden fishing vessels have drifted ashore](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/news/japanindepth/20151126.html) from the Sea of Japan on the Japanese coast. On board were 25 badly decomposed bodies. The vessels contained nets and fishing gear and are believed to have come from the Korean peninsula. A scrap of cloth secured to a mast might have been part of a North Korean flag and markings on one vessel in Hangul read, **“**Korean People’s Army.”  It is unclear whether the boats and the bodies are related to a new fishing initiative by Kim Jong-un, or whether the boats were used in a failed attempt to defect from North Korea.
