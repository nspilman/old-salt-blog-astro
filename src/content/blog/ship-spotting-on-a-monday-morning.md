Will, over at the [Tugster blog](http://tugster.wordpress.com/), is no doubt the preeminent New York harbor ship-spotter.  If one is so inclined, it is easy to spent far more time than one might have planned browsing his thousands of photographs – all well organized and accompanied by fascinating commentary.  On the other side of the Atlantic,  Fred Vloo’s Ship-spotting channel on You-tube is extremely well done.  His [Shipspotting Rotterdam 15 mei](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5QiBkaEow4&feature=related) features great footage of tankers, bulker carriers, tugs, pilot boat, launches and container ships of all sizes, including the 8,000 TEU *Anna Maersk.*
