[![diana-portrait](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/09/diana-portrait.jpg)Diana Nyad](http://www.diananyad.com/) is nearing the five mile countdown to Key West on her epic 112 statute mile swim from Cuba to Florida. If she completes the swim, she will be the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a cage, wet suit or flippers.  Nyad is 64 years old.  This is her fifth attempt to swim across the Florida Straits.  The last several attempts have been thwarted by jellyfish stings to her face and mouth.  In this attempt, Nyad is using a special mask to prevent jellyfish stings to her tongue — a key factor in her failed attempt in August 2012.

[John Bartlett, Nyad’s navigator,](http://www.diananyad.com/blog) who has been on the escort boat Voyager throughout the swim, comments “*Diana has stopped numerous times to tread water trying to restore herself….The greatest variable here is the extension of human endurance; how long will it take her to make those last 100 strokes at the end, and all the ones from here to then?*”

The last miles could be the most difficult.  Dr. Kot, one of Diana’s two team doctors, [reported this morning](http://www.diananyad.com/blog/doctor-report-715am) at around 7:30 AM that Diana’s tongue and lips are swollen causing her speech to be slurred. He and Dr. Covington are concerned about Diana’s airways, but did not intervene.

Diana has said this is her final attempt. She posted on her website that she wants to prove “it’s never too late to chase your dream.”
