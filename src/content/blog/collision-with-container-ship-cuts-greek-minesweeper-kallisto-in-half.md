![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kallista.jpg)The Greek Navy minesweeper [HS *Kallisto* was cut in half](https://www.fleetmon.com/maritime-news/2020/31401/container-ship-maersk-launceston-cut-two-greek-nav/) following a collision with the containership [*Maersk Launceston*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/MAERSK-LAUNCESTON-IMO-9294408-MMSI-255805664). The stern of the minesweeper apparently sank following the collision while the bow was taken under tow by salvors. The minesweeper’s crew was evacuated. Two of the crew were reported to be injured.  

The *Maersk Launceston* was leaving Piraeus, Greece, bound for Canakkale, Turkey when the collision took place at 0740 UTC, today.  The container ship was ordered to return to Piraeus pending an investigation. The ship’s captain has been arrested. The container ship is reported to have sustained slight damage to her bow.

The HS *Kallisto* was originally the [HMS *Berkeley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Berkeley_\(M40\)), a Royal Navy Hunt-class mine countermeasures vessel built in 1987. She was sold to Greece in 2001. The minesweeper was 60 meters long with a 9.8-meter beam.

*Maersk Launceston* is a 4,045 TEU Portuguese registered container ship. She is 266 meters long and 38 meters wide.
