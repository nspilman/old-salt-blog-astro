](https://youtu.be/IfOieWw249c)

From [NBC4](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Fleet-Week-2019-Ships-New-York-Harbor-510250901.html): The signature Parade of Ships kicked off the festivities Wednesday morning as Naval and Coast Guard ships sailed up the Hudson River into New York City, traveling past the Museum’s Pier 86 before docking around the city.

The ships were seen along the Hudson River from Battery Park to just south of the George Washington Bridge. Fort Hamilton also conducted an 11-gun salute to the flagship, USS New York, as the ship passes by.

The week-long event gives the public the opportunity to meet Sailors, Marines and Coast Guardsmen, as well as witness firsthand the latest capabilities of maritime services.

This year marks the 31st annual event that features a week filled of of activities, themed events and live demonstrations.

Numerous ships are participating in this year’s event around New York City and will be docked in Pier 88 and Pier 86 in Manhattan, as well as in Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, Homeport Pier on Staten Island, Kings Point and SUNY Maritime College in the Bronx.
