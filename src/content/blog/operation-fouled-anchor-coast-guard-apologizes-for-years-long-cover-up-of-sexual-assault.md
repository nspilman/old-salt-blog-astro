![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/uscglogo.jpg)[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/30/politics/coast-guard-academy-secret-sexual-assault-investigation-invs/index.html) reports that a secret investigation into alleged sexual abuse at the US Coast Guard Academy uncovered a dark history of rapes, assaults, and other serious misconduct being ignored and, at times, covered up by high-ranking officials.

The findings of the probe, dubbed “Operation Fouled Anchor,” were kept confidential by the agency’s top leadership for several years. Coast Guard officials briefed members of Congress this month after inquiries from CNN, which had reviewed internal documents from the probe.

Despite credible evidence of assaults dating back to the late 1980s, investigators found that most of the alleged perpetrators were not criminally investigated at the time. Instead, the incidents were handled as administrative violations, and punishments, if they happened at all, were as minor as extra homework or lowered class standings. Sometimes, even those pushed out of the academy were still able to serve in the US military.

In a statement, a Coast Guard spokesman apologized to the victims, saying that “by not having taken appropriate action at the time of the sexual assaults, the Coast Guard may have further traumatized the victims, delayed access to their care and recovery, and prevented some cases from being referred to the military justice system for appropriate accountability.”

“This investigation made clear that the \[school’s\] leadership was more concerned at that time about organizational and \[Coast Guard Academy\] reputation than about the victims of crimes who were members of our service,” a draft of the Fouled Anchor final report from 2019 said.

[In a press release on Friday,](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2023/6/cantwell-baldwin-want-more-answers-accountability-from-coast-guard-following-disclosure-of-operation-fouled-anchor-and-decades-long-hidden-reports-of-sexual-assault) U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, and Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Chair of the Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries, Climate Change and Manufacturing, which oversees the Coast Guard, sent a letter to the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Linda Fagan, seeking answers and accountability for the mishandling of a previously undisclosed, years-long investigation into sexual assault allegations in connection to the Coast Guard Academy. The Committee learned of these reports that had previously been withheld from Congress and the public through its routine oversight role during a briefing from the Coast Guard.

“We write to express our grave concern regarding the reports of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment at the United States Coast Guard Academy between 1988 and 2006 and the Coast Guard’s lack of action to properly and timely investigate, prosecute, and report these criminal acts,” wrote the senators in their letter. “We are also concerned about the Coast Guard’s failure to disclose its investigation that began in 2014 and ended in 2020, the withholding of which some have described as intentional.”
