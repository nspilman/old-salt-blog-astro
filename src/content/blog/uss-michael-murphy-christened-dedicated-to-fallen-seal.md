*Under clear, blue skies, a ship dedicated to fallen Medal of Honor recipient and Navy SEAL Lt. Michael Murphy was christened Saturday by his mother, Maureen, at Bath Iron Works shipyard in Maine.*

*“I feel not only Michael’s presence, but that ship embodies the spirits of Michael and his teammates,” Murphy’s father, Daniel, told CNN.*

*Following tradition, Murphy’s mother cracked a bottle of champagne against the hull of the USS Michael Murphy.*

*“Happy Birthday, son!” Murphy’s mom said on what would have been her son’s 35th birthday. His life was cut short in the mountains of Afghanistan in 2005.*

*Dr. Josh Appel, an Air Force Reserve flight surgeon, helped retrieve Murphy’s body after a firefight that claimed the lives of 18 other troops, including 2 SEALs from Murphy’s team.*

*Appel called the christening “a symbolic gesture that brings Michael’s spirit into the ship.”*
