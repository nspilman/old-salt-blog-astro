Gabart Arriving in Brest

Congratulations to [Francois Gabart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Gabart) who just [set a new record](http://www.wionews.com/world/around-the-world-in-42-days-frenchman-smashes-solo-sailing-record-26977) for sailing around the world single-handed. The 34-year old Gabart sailed his 30 meter (98 foot) long MACIF maxi-trimaran around the globe alone in a remarkable 42 days, 16 hours, 40 minutes and 35 seconds, breaking the previous record set by Thomas Coville last year by six days and 10 hours.  Over the 27,860-mile journey, Gabart achieved an amazing average speed of 27.2 knots. 

Francois Gabart is not new to setting records. In November, we [posted about Gabart setting a new solo 24-hour speed record](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/11/solo-sailor-francois-gabart-sets-new-record-851-miles-24-hours/) of 851 miles sailed in 24 hours. In 2013, [Gabar won the Vendée Globe round-the-world single-handed race in 78 days](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/01/around-the-world-in-78-days-francois-gabart-sets-new-record-winning-vendee-globe/) and two hours, shattering the previous record of 84 days and three hours.
