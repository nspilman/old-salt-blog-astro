The site of the “lost fleet” was discovered in the 1970s, while the wreckage of the lost fleet was located in 2000.   Maritime archaeologist Jim Delgado wrote about the discovery in his book, *[Khubilai Khan’s Lost Fleet: In Search of a Legendary Armada,](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520265858/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0520265858)* in 2008.  The paperback edition was published last summer.   It is a fascinating story.
