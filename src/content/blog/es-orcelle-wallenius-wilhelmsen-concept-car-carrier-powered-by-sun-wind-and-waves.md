In a recent Working Harbor Committee presentation, “[Sailing Ships at Work – Past, Present and Future](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/03/sailing-ships-at-work-then-and-now-working-harbor-committee-presentation-april-10th/),” we included the [E/S *Orcelle*, a Wallenius Wilhelmsen concept car carrier design](http://www.2wglobal.com/www/environment/orcelleGreenFlagship/), as an example of an innovative design that featured wing sails, as one part of its hybrid propulsion system.  While the wing sails, which also include solar cells, are interesting, the overall design is also worth a closer look.  The car carrier concept design is intended to produce zero emissions beyond heat and water vapor and to be propelled by fuel cells, wave energy, solar and wind power.  The radical hull form also requires no ballast water for stability and provides greater car carrying capacity that conventional ships.  First unveiled at the [Nordic Pavilion at the World Expo 2005](http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/apr2005/2005-04-06-03.asp), it is a fascinating design from stem to stern.
