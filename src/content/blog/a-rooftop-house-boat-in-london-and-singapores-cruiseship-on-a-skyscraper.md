Roi des Belges

A quick look at two quirky structures that look like a boat and a ship left high and dry.

What appears to be a modest houseboat is perched above the Purcell Room of Queen Elizabeth Hall at the Southbank Centre in London. Described as an “*instant landmark that melds a boat (with room for two) with a view of the Thames*,” the art installation/boat will remain in place through the end of 2012.” [Living Architecture](http://www.living-architecture.co.uk/the-houses/aroomforlondon/overview/), the organization that oversees [the one-bedroom boat, named the *Roi des Belges*,](http://aroomforlondon.co.uk/the-boat/the-design) rents it out by the night and reports that it is fully booked for the year. The perched houseboat was designed by David Kohn Architects in collaboration with Fiona Banner.

SkyPark - a cruise ship on a skyscraper

On the other side of the globe, the SkyPark at the 55 story [Marina Bay Sands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Bay_Sands) in Singapore is often referred to as a “cruise ship on a skyscraper.”  Actually, three skyscrapers. The complex was developed by Las Vegas Sands, and is it is billed as the world’s most expensive standalone casino property at S$8 billion, (US$6.3 billion) including real estate costs. The “cruise ship” portion of the development is the 340 m-long SkyPark with a capacity of 3,900 people and a 150m infinity swimming pool, set on top of the world’s largest public cantilevered platform, which overhangs the north tower by 67m. The SkyPark opened on 24 June 2010.
