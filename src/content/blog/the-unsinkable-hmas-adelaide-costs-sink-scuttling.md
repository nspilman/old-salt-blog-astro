As difficult as it is to keep ships afloat, sometimes they can be devilishly hard to sink as well.   At least that has been the experience of a group trying to scuttle the decommissioned [HMAS *Adelaide*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Adelaide_\(FFG_01\)) as an artificial reef and recreational diving site off the central coast of Australia.  After years of lawsuits, the project is over budget by several million dollars and is facing even further delays.
