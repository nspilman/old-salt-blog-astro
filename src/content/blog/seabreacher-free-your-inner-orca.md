We recently posted about [personal submarines](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/09/28/you-boat-your-own-personal-submarine-a-quick-look-at-whats-going-down/). In browsing around in that market, we came across the [“Seabreacher”](http://www.seabreacher.com/) and thought that it deserved a separate look.   The Seabreachers by Innerspace are definitely the most brilliant, crazy, or perhaps a bit of both, personal  watercraft out there.  They are snorkel fed  submersibles which can travel at up to 55 mph on the the surface and around 20 mph just below it.  And just for the fun of it, or perhaps merely to mess with the minds of nearby whale watchers, one model looks rather like an orca.  Additionally,  the “orca” model, Seabreacher Y, can be outfitted with riding pegs and a handlebar attachment to allow a stunt man to ride on the back and perform tricks. The Seabreacher X looks a bit like a shark. The non-orca or shark Seabreachers look like something from a James Bond movie. They also have a “Dolphin” Seabreacher  which  Innerspace has used as a “a research and development platform ” but is not in commercial production.  Prices start at US$ 65,000 for a standard model and at US$ 81,000 for the orca-like Model Y.

Seabreachers are Coast Guard approved as personal watercraft.  The manufacturers  “*strongly recommend that a support boat is present whenever you operate a Seabreacher. This is not as much for the Seabreacher but more to help keep other boaters or water users from coming too close to the vessel when it is operating. We also recommend having radio communication between the vessel and chase boat as an added precaution. We continue to use a support boat every time we go out, even after ten years of operation*.”
