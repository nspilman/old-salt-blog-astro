Herman Melville’s grave

[Herman Melville](http://melvillesociety.org/) died September 28, 1891.  He was indeed a great American writer, some would argue the great American writer. He was also the greatest failed writer of his day. When he died all of his books had been out of print for more than 30 years. When he died, many commented that they thought that he had been dead for years. The book that would ruin his career was *Moby Dick*, which we know call his greatest masterpiece.

Melville is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx in New York City.  The grave is distinctive because it features a blank scroll.  It is said that Melville designed the memorial, some say out of bitterness for the way his life’s work as a writer had come to naught.  Whether there is any truth to the story may be unknowable. Nevertheless, every writer understands both the opportunity and the terror of the blank page.

Melville’s grave has become a shrine of sorts for writers.  Many leave pens behind in homage. Some leave all or parts of manuscripts weighted down by rocks or pebbles. The cemetery park rangers say that when the rains come, the sheets of paper soften then melt away until they seem to blend into the stone.

It just so happens that tonight I am in London at the Historical Novel Society Conference, which begins in about an hour  with a cocktail party.  I will be sure to raise a class to Herman Melville and to all writers who daily must face the blank page.
