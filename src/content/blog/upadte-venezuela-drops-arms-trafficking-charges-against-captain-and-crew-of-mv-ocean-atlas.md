![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/09/ocean-atlas-large.jpg)Good news.  On Friday, we posted that [the captain of the U.S. flag heavy lift ship, MV *Ocean Atlas,* had been arrested](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/09/07/venezuela-detains-u-s-flag-mv-ocean-atlas-arrests-captain-and-detains-crew/) in Maracaibo, Venezuela after three rifles were found aboard the ship. The rifles had reportedly been listed in the ship’s manifest.  Reports are that Venezuelan authorities had raided the ship, acting on a tip that illegal drugs were onboard.  When no drugs were found,  Captain Jeffrey Raider was arrested for arms trafficking based on the three locked-away rifles. There were reports that the rest of the 14 man crew would also be charged.  A U.S. State Department official confirmed Sunday that the charges had been dropped.  The ship is expected to sail today or tomorrow.

The M/V [*Ocean Atlas*](http://www.intermarineusa.com/fleet/pdfs/Ocean%20vessels%20description.pdf) is an 8,000 DWT multipurpose ship with a 400 tonne lifting capacity. One of four heavy-lift vessels of [Intermarine’s U.S.-flag heavy-lift affiliate, U.S. Ocean](http://www.intermarineusa.com/fleet/ocean-atlas.php), the ship is operated by [Crowley](http://www.crowley.com/).
