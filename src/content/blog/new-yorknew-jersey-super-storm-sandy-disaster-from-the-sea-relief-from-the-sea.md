USS Wasp

The super-storm Sandy swept in from the Atlantic on Monday night, leaving millions without power, destroying thousands of homes, killing scores and dramatically rearranging the landscape of the Jersey shore. Many New York subways went underwater. Fuel supplies are extremely low as gas stations initially lacked power to pump fuel and now lack supplies. Two of the three local refineries are shut-down due to the storm.

While relief is being sent from all over the country, much is coming by sea.  [New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that a flotilla of ships and barges](http://gma.yahoo.com/relief-sandys-gas-pains-061645645--abc-news-topstories.html) began unloading gasoline in New York to help ease the shortages. The U.S. government also issued a [Jones Act waiver](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/02/us-storm-sandy-oil-waivers-new-idUSBRE8A11C620121102) on Friday allowing foreign tankers in the Gulf of Mexico to supply the Northeast with fuel after Hurricane Sandy.

The US Navy is also sending ships. The first to arrive is the helicopter carrier [USS *Wasp*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Wasp_\(LHD-1\)) (LHD-1) which was originally sent out to sea to escape Hurricane Sandy and how has been sent to the New Jersey coast to help survivors. Also on their way are the amphibious transport dock ships, [USS *San Antonio* (LPD-17)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_San_Antonio_\(LPD-17\)) and [USS *Carter Hall* (LSD-50)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Carter_Hall_\(LSD-50\)).  [Massachusetts Maritime Academy](http://www.maritime.edu/) is also dispatching the 576 foot training ship, [T.S. *Kennedy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TS_Kennedy), to serve as temporary housing for relief workers.
