![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/newarkfire.jpg)Last Wednesday night at 9:38 PM, a fire broke out on the 10th deck of the ro-ro/container ship, [*Grande Costa D’Avorio*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:281391/mmsi:247311200/imo:9465382/vessel:GRANDE_COSTA_D_AVORIO), docked at Port Newark, as vehicle loading operations were underway. The fire broke out in five to seven cars and spread quickly to the 11th and 12th decks of the ship. The crew of the vessel immediately activated the on-board fire suppression procedures while the local firefighters were alerted. 

Tragically, [two firefighters](https://www.nj.com/essex/2023/07/2-firefighters-killed-battling-ship-cargo-fire-in-newark.html?e=5c33e11c52ff0787a33082b461be8a62&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2-ff-killed&utm_term=Newsletter_breaking_news), Augusto Acabou, 45, and Wayne Brooks Jr., 49, died after becoming trapped while fighting the fire. Several other firefighters were injured. The fire burned for several days and was finally brought under control on Sunday. Fortunately, the ship owner reported that there were no electric cars or hazardous cargo on board.

Shipboard fires at ports are relatively rare and difficult to train for, given the range of ship types and sizes. Initial reports suggest a certain level of confusion as to roles and responsibilities in responding to the fire. 

[NJ.com](https://www.nj.com/news/2023/07/hoses-deployed-to-tackle-fatal-ship-fire-were-not-big-enough-firefighter-official-says.html) reports that according to city officials, a fire brigade from Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was already at Port Newark trying to extinguish the blaze on the *Grande Costa d’Avori* when Newark firefighters arrived at the scene late Wednesday night, they said at a press conference on Thursday.

“Obviously this became an issue where they (the Port Authority) just didn’t have the capacity at all to deal with what was going on, so we had to take full control,” said Newark Fire Chief Rufus Jackson.

The Port Authority said Thursday evening, however, there was no agency fire brigade. Officials there said that at all non-airport facilities, firefighting is handled by the local municipality with jurisdictional responsibility.”

In the aftermath of the fire, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is considering [creating its own firefighting force](https://www.nj.com/essex/2023/07/port-authority-to-consider-creating-its-own-firefighting-force-at-port-newark-after-fatal-blaze.html).

Shawn Balcomb, a spokesman for the Washington-based American Association of Port Authorities observed, “Most port authorities do not have dedicated fire departments, but instead work closely with local authorities and coast guard offices to train and prepare for emergencies.”

“Shipboard firefighting is a unique skill,” Chief Jackson said, “and this is not a common fire for the city of Newark and the Newark firefighters.”

Jackson, meanwhile, called the circumstances of the fire “unique,” and could not recall how long ago the department trained on shipboard firefighting. But even that training, he said, involved firefighting aboard a vessel with living quarters and various compartments. This was a cargo ship.

The fire chief also suggested a lack of experienced firefighters may have contributed.

There is also some apparent confusion regarding the size of the ship’s fire hoses. Reports say that the shipboard fire hoses were only 1 inch in diameter and that standard, 2.5-inch hose lines would not connect to the equipment on the European-built ship. 

What is unclear is that SOLAS regs mandate a minimum 38mm (1.5-inch) fire hose. Also, an international shore connection (ISC) is required by IMO SOLAS to be available on all ships. The ISC provides connections for 2.5-inch hose lines.

By Thursday, the Coast Guard, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Newark Fire Department, and Gallagher Marine Systems, the representative for the ship operator, established a [Unified Command](https://www.news.uscg.mil/Press-Releases/Article/3450658/unified-command-established-for-vessel-fire-in-newark-new-jersey/) in Port Newark, supported by a host of federal, state and local emergency response agencies. 

As of 5 PM yesterday, the Port Newark Channel has reopened. The Port of New York and New Jersey remains open and operational.
