In June, we posted [drone footage](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/06/a-drone-visit-to-gradually-reopening-mystic-seaport-museum/) of [Mystic Seaport](https://www.mysticseaport.org/) as it was gradually reopening after being shut down by the pandemic. The grass was summer green, the river was shimmering deep blue, and the masts and spars of historic ships rose against a pale sky and billowing clouds. 

Here is a very different view of the seaport, capturing the solitude of winter.
