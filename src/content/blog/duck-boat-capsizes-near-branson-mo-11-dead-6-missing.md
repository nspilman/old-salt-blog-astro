![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/bransonduckboat.jpg)At least 11 people died on Thursday when an [amphibious duck boat capsized in Table Rock Lake](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/us/branson-boat-capsize-missouri.html) near Branson, Mo. Six people are still missing. The boat capsized in a thunderstorm in winds reported to be 70 or 80 mph. Of the 31 people on the boat, 29 were passengers and two were crew members. Seven people were taken to a hospital, and two people are reported to be in critical condition at Cox Medical Center Branson. Two duck boats were on the lake when the storm hit. One boat was able to make it to shore.

This may be the worst duck boat tragedy in history. In 1999, 13 died when a [duck boat sank in Arkansas](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/13-dead-in-boat-accident/) after a mechanical failure. Two duck boat passengers also died in 2010 when a [duck boat was run down by a barge](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/philadelphia-duck-boat-overturns-in-collision-with-barge-in-delaware-river/) in the Delaware River.  

In recent years, the duck boat fatalities have been onshore. In 2016, a [woman on a motor scooter died](https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/24/us/seattle-tour-bus-duck-tour-fatal-accident/index.html) after being struck by a duck boat in Boston. [Four died when a duck boat collided with a tour bus](https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/24/us/seattle-tour-bus-duck-tour-fatal-accident/index.html) in Seattle in 2015.

As noted by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44895391): *There are hundreds of so-called duck boats in use around the world. The amphibious vehicles are popular with tourists and have been providing tours for decades.*

*While duck boats have been involved in a number of fatal accidents over the years, such incidents are relatively rare. In the past two decades, more fatalities have been recorded in connection with golf courses than duck boats, according to US statistics.*
