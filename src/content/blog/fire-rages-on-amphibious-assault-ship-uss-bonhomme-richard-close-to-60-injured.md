![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/firebhr.jpg)On Sunday at around 8 AM Pacific Time, an [explosion and fire were reported](https://news.usni.org/2020/07/13/fire-fight-intensifies-on-uss-bonhomme-richard-5-sailors-still-hospitalized) aboard the amphibious assault ship [USS *Bonhomme Richard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bonhomme_Richard_\(LHD-6\)) dockside at the Naval Base San Diego. More than 24 hours later, the fire is still raging. Fifty-seven sailors, firefighters, and contractors are reported to have been injured in fighting the fire. Most of those injured suffered from heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation. Five are reported to be still hospitalized in stable condition. Of the approximately 1,000 crew, only around 160 were aboard the ship when the fire broke out.

The ship was undergoing maintenance when the fire broke out. All crew members have been accounted for. The cause of the fire is still unknown, although it is believed to have started in the lower cargo hold of the ship, known as the “Deep V,” according to a [statement to reporters by Rear Adm. Philip Sobeck](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2020/07/12/amphibious-assault-ship-ablaze-in-port-san-diego/), commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 3.

The fire is reported to have [spread to the ship’s island superstructure and bridge](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/34772/uss-bonhomme-richards-bridge-engulfed-in-flames-as-fire-rages-into-the-night). It’s unclear how long it will take to control the fire and whether the ship is repairable or whether it will be declared a constructive total loss.

[Thick plumes of smoke continue to billow](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/smell-that-smoke-ongoing-navy-ship-fire-prompts-concerns-of-air-quality/2364314/) from the burning ship and local residents are advised to remain indoors over air-quality concerns.

The *Bonhomme Richard* is one of eight [Wasp Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasp-class_amphibious_assault_ship) landing helicopter dock (LHD) commissioned in 1988. The ships are capable of transporting almost the full strength of a United States Marine Corps Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), and landing them in hostile territory via landing craft or helicopters, as well as providing air support via AV-8B Harrier II attack aircraft or F-35B Lightning II stealth strike-fighters.
