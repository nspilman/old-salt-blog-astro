![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ChadBaybayan.jpg)Chad Kālepa Baybayan, a revered Hawaiian navigator and captain of the Polynesian voyaging canoe *[Hōkūleʻa](http://www.hokulea.com/voyages/our-story/)*, died on April 8 while visiting family in Seattle. He was 64. His daughter Kala Tanaka said the cause was a heart attack.

Chad Kalepa Baybayan, part of the Hawaiian renaissance of Polynesian voyaging, was [one of only five Hawaiians](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2021/04/09/breaking-news/master-navigator-chad-kalepa-baybayan-dies/) along with 11 Micronesians initiated in 2007 into Pwo, a 2,000-year-old society of deep-sea navigators, by Master Navigator Mau Piailug of Satawal.

Beginning in the late 1970s, Baybayan sailed on *Hokule’a* for more than 40 years. He also served as captain and navigator on the voyaging canoes [*Hawaiiloa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawai%CA%BBiloa#Canoe) and [*Hokualakai*](http://archive.hokulea.com/ike/kalai_waa/hokualakai.html). He sailed on major voyages in the South Pacific, the West Coast of North America, Micronesia, and Japan.

I was fortunate enough to have briefly crossed paths with Chad Kālepa Baybayan when he and apprentice navigator Celeste Manuia Haʻo introduced the [art of wayfinding the ocean](http://www.hokulea.com/event/he-lani-ko-luna/) with non-instrument navigation at the Hayden Planetarium when the *Hokule’a* called in New York on its epic circumnavigation in 2016. One of the messages of the evening was that “in losing sight of the land, you discover stars.”
