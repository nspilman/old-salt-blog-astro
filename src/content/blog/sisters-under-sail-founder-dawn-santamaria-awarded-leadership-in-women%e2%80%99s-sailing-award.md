![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Leadership-in-Womens-Saili.gif)On a hazy summer’s morning I happened to see the topsail schooner *[Unicorn](http://www.tallshipunicorn.com/index.html)* leave the gas dock at Liberty Landing marina on the Hudson River.   The *Unicorn* is a particularly lovely topsail schooner converted from a  North Sea fishing vessel.  As I admired the well balanced and robust lines of the *Unicorn*, I noticed that everyone aboard appeared to be female.  I didn’t know then that Dawn Santamaria, one of the owners of the Unicorn, had founded “[Sisters Under Sail](http://www.sistersundersail.org/),”  a program to introduce girls to tall ship sailing.  Last Saturday, Dawn Santamaria, was honored with the [2011 Leadership In Women’s Sailing Award](http://www.sistersundersail.org/sus2011/inthenews.html) at the [National Women’s Sailing Association](http://www.womensailing.org/) Conference, in Marblehead, MA.  Congratulations to Ms. Santamaria.   See also our post from last August, [“Sisters Under Sail” – Schooner Unicorn at Tall Ships Chicago](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/27/sisters-under-sail-schooner-unicorn-at-tall-ships-chicago/) .
