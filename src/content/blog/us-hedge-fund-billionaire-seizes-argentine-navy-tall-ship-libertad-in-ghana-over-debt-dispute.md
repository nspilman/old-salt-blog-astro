![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Q2ARALibertad.jpg)The [Argentine Navy training ship *Libertad*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_Libertad_\(Q-2\)) and her crew of over 200, docked in port of Tema, Ghana, were seized by a court order obtained by NML Capital Ltd., a subsidiary of Elliot Capital Management, a hedge fund run by the [US billionaire Paul Singer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Singer_\(businessman\)).  Argentina’s Foreign Ministry accused the Ghanaian court of violating rules of diplomatic immunity.

The conflict is over a more than a decade long legal battle between Argentina and hold-out creditors. In 2001 and 2002 Argentina defaulted on more than $100bn of debt, the biggest default in history. About 94% of these loans were restructured in 2005 and 2010, returning creditors roughly 30 cents on their dollar. Elliot Capital was among the 6% who did not participate in the restructuring and continued with legal action against Argentina.

Paul Singer is well known as a “vulture capitalist” whose business model is to buy distressed debt cheaply and to sell it at a profit or to sue for full payment.  Singer is a major donor to the Republican Party.   Reportedly, the ship and crew will be released on the payment of a bond.

*The Libertad and its 200 strong crew of Naval cadets on their graduation tour can only leave port if the Argentine government posts a bond with the court in Ghana, which the hedge fund could then seek to recover.*

In this case, at least, the tactics used by Somali pirates and vulture capitalists seem remarkably similar.
