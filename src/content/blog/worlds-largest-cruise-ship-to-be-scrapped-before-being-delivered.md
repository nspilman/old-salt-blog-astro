![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/goldendream.jpg)A cruise ship that would have ranked as one of the world’s largest is going straight from the shipyard building ways to the scrappers. 

Cruise and resort business operator, Genting HK, contracted with its own shipyard in 2016 to build [two 9,000-passenger cruise ships.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global-class_cruise_ship) The ships were to be the world’s largest, by number of passengers if not quite in tonnage. 

The first ship, the *Global Dream* was about 80% complete when Genting HK collapsed into bankruptcy last February. The shipyard, MV Werften, owned by Genting, also filed for bankruptcy.

The second vessel, unnamed but often referred to as the *Global Dream II*, was roughly half-finished when work stopped.  Most of the ship’s machinery and equipment had already been delivered to the shipyard. 

[An bord](https://anbord-de.translate.goog/global-dream-ii-wird-verschrottet/?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp), a German maritime publication, reports that insolvency administrator, Christoph Morgen, recently announced at a press conference that attempts are now being made to resell some of the systems and engines. The half-finished *Global Dream II* hull is then to be sold at scrap prices.

The shipyard’s new owner wants the building ways cleared. ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems purchased the shipyard and ants to build submarines, corvettes and frigates in the yard in Wismar.

The disposition of the *Golden Dream* has yet to be determined.
