![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/03/status6.jpg)In a speech yesterday, [Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened the United States](http://www.businessinsider.com/putin-confirms-russian-doomsday-nuclear-weapon-in-annual-speech-2018-3?r=UK&IR=T) with a new generation of nuclear weapons. Putin showed video animations of nuclear warheads raining down on Florida from a new design of an intercontinental cruise missile that he described as  [“invincible.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/world/europe/russia-putin-speech.html) Perhaps even more disturbing was the presentation of a [“doomsday” torpedo](http://www.news.com.au/technology/pentagon-confirms-existence-of-russian-doomsday-weapon/news-story/16ef0f8642b1699f805f324489942345) designed to create a 500-meter tsunami that could contaminate a large section of coastline with radiation, making the area unlivable for up to a century.

The new weapon, called [Status-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status-6_Oceanic_Multipurpose_System) by the Russians and dubbed Kanyon by the CIA, is described as an unmanned nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed underwater vehicle able to deliver a thermonuclear cobalt bomb of up to 100 megatonnes. It is said to have a top speed of 100 km/h (54 kn), with a range of 10,000 km (5,400 NM.)  Russian Oscar Class submarines are said to be capable of carrying up to four of the torpedoes secured externally.

The Status-6 was [first revealed on Russian television](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/12/putins-doomsday-machine-nuclear-weapon-us-russia/) when a program showed images of President Vladimir Putin visiting naval commanders in Sochi, with one shot showing an officer looking at what appeared to be plans for a Status-6 torpedo. 

Last month, the Pentagon included the [Status-6 in its Nuclear Posture Review,](https://www.defensenews.com/space/2018/01/12/russias-nuclear-underwater-drone-is-real-and-in-the-nuclear-posture-review/) suggesting that it is taking the development of the weapon seriously.  Some [experts doubt the weapon is being developed](http://www.newsweek.com/russia-develops-doomsday-nuclear-torpedo-designed-wipe-out-us-coastal-cities-798946) while others claim that it is already [being tested in the Arctic](https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/security/2016/12/did-russia-test-doomsday-weapon-arctic-waters).  

If the Status-6 is operational, the [US Navy may not currently have any way to counter the threat](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-navy-may-have-no-way-counter-russias-status-6-nuclear-24193).
