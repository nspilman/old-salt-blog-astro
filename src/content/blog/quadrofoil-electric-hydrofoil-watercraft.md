![Quadrafoilq2](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/08/Quadrafoilq2.jpg)I hate jet-skis. They are noisy, exhaust-spewing and dangerous. I am amazed that more people don’t get killed by running them into other boats or seawalls, or just [by falling off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_watercraft-related_accidents#Internal_Orifice_Injuries). I recently came across a potential alternative to these noxious beasts — the [Quadrafoil](https://quadrofoil.com/en/), the first all-electric hydrofoiling personal watercraft.  As reported by [Gizmag](http://www.gizmag.com/quadrofoil-hydrofoil-electric-personal-watercraft/34528/):

*The radically finned Quadrofoil is described as a hydrofoiling personal watercraft (PWC), but unlike other [PWCs](http://www.gizmag.com/belassi-b3r-sport-worlds-most-powerful-pwc-jet-ski/34342/) the Quadrofoil produces marginal noise pollution, zero emissions, and creates only the tiniest of waves. As a result, the company claims the quad-finned watercraft could in theory access more environmentally sensitive areas where noise and wave disturbances are prohibited.* (Video after the page break.)

*Available in two models and capable of carrying two adults, the Quadrofoil, without foils attached, takes up 1.5 m (5 ft) from side to side, while standing 1.2 m tall (4 ft) and measuring just under 3 m (10 ft) in length.*

*The Q2S has a 5.5 kW motor and longer lasting 10 kWh batteries and is said to be good for a top speed of 40 km/h (21 knots) above the water. The cheaper Q2A gets its power from a QE 3.7 kW electric motor and 4.5 kWh batteries and tops out at 30 km/h (16 knots).*

The one downside is cost. The average cost of a gasoline powered jet ski is around $12,000, while the most expensive run over $18,000.  The limited edition Q2S is available for US$28,000 on pre-order now, with the Q2A version costing $18,700. While the Quadrofoils are somewhat more expensive to purchase, they are incredibly cheap to operate.

The first run of the Quadrofoil Q2S has sold out. The Q2A is expected to start shipping in the first quarter of 2016.
