![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ssus2.jpg)After decades of working to save the historic ocean liner [SS *United States*](https://www.ssusc.org/the-ship), the [SS United States Conservancy](https://www.ssusc.org/) has made the difficult choice to sell the old liner to be sunk to create the world’s largest artificial reef, off the coast of Destin-Fort Walton Beach in the Gulf of Mexico.

According to Okaloosa County, FL documents, the Tourist Development Department is requesting approval for a budget allocation of up to $9 million for the acquisition, remediation, transport, and deployment of the SS *United States*. This project also includes plans for a land-based museum dedicated to the ship according to [getthecoast.com](https://www.getthecoast.com/okaloosa-county-to-acquire-ss-united-states-for-worlds-largest-artificial-reef-off-destin-fort-walton-beach/).

The SS *United States*, a 990-foot vessel launched in 1952, still holds the Blue Riband for the fastest transatlantic crossing by an ocean liner. Currently docked in Philadelphia, the ship faced legal challenges when a federal judge ruled on June 14, 2024, that it must vacate its location within 90 days. 

The county has identified three active permitted areas that can accommodate the SS *United States*, all less than 25 miles from shore. These sites offer depths and clearance requirements suitable for divers of various skill levels, from beginners to technical divers.

Of the $9 million budget, $1 million is allocated for the ship’s purchase. The county has until September 12 to complete due diligence, which began in early August. Closing is set to occur on or before October 4, 2024. 

The SS United States Conservancy, the current owner, has committed to developing a land-based museum in conjunction with the artificial reef, which would serve to continue the iconic vessel’s legacy and provide non-divers the opportunity to learn about “America’s Flagship” and its rich history. 

Okaloosa County will provide up to $1 million for museum-related costs, including property purchase, construction, or renovation of an existing building/property for the museum and its exhibits.

At 990 feet, the SS *United States* would surpass the [USS *Oriskany*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Oriskany#2004_%E2%80%93_artificial_reef) (888 feet) as the world’s largest intentional artificial reef. The *Oriskany*, sunk off Panama City, FL in 2006, continues to attract divers and generate economic benefits nearly two decades later.

The presence of two of the world’s largest artificial reefs in northwest Florida is expected to solidify the region’s status as a top destination for scuba diving and fishing activities.

As we [posted in 2023](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2023/01/ss-united-states-exploration-of-the-abandoned-ocean-liner/), the [SS *United States*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States) is a ship from another era. One of the last great ocean liners, very different from modern cruise ships, she was designed to carry passengers across oceans.  On her maiden voyage in 1952, she set speed records crossing the Atlantic in both directions, earning the coveted [Blue Riband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Riband).

Nevertheless, from the start, her days in liner service were numbered. Only five years after entering service, Boeing introduced the [Model 707](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_707), the first widely adopted long-range commercial jetliner. The 707 ushered in the [Jet Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Age) and marked the end of the [Golden age of ocean liners](https://www.throughouthistory.com/?p=416).

*United States* maintained an uninterrupted schedule of transatlantic passenger service until 1969 when she was laid up. The ship was sold several times since the 1970s, with each new owner trying unsuccessfully to make the liner profitable. Eventually, the ship’s fittings were sold at auction, and hazardous wastes, including asbestos panels throughout the ship, were removed, leaving her almost completely stripped by 1994. Two years later, she was towed to Pier 82 on the Delaware River, in Philadelphia, where she spent close to 30 years, [until threatened with eviction](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2023/06/retired-passenger-liner-ss-united-states-threatened-by-eviction-from-philadelphia-pier/).
