Star*, confirming that it was the target of a terrorist attack.    The ship  was struck by an explosion just after midnight on July 28, as the vessel was traveling through the Strait of Hormuz.   A group with ties to Al-Qaida has claimed responsibility for the attack.

*“An examination carried out by specialised teams has confirmed that the tanker has been the subject of a terrorist attack,” the official WAM news agency said, quoting a UAE coastguard. “UAE explosives experts who collected and examined samples found a dent on the starboard side above the waterline and remains of homemade explosives on the hull. Probably the tanker had encountered a terrorist attack from a boat laden with explosives.”*

*The report comes two days after a militant group known as the Brigades of Abdullah Azzam, which has links to al-Qaida, claimed responsibility for the attack. Al-Qaida has identified the area, through which 40% of the world’s seaborne oil passes, as a potential target.*
