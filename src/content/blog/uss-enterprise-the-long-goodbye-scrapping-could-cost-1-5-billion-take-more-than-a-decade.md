![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bige.jpg)We recently posted about how the US Navy’s [last two non-nuclear carriers were sold for scrap](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/10/last-conventionally-powered-carriers-kitty-hawk-john-f-kennedy-sold-for-a-penny-each/) for the modest sum of one cent each. By some standards, that was not such a bad deal.  A recent report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) says that it could cost the Navy more than $1.5 billion to fully dispose of the retired ex-[USS *Enterprise*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_\(CVN-65\)), a complete process that could take more than an additional decade to finish.

The *Enterprise* (CVN-65), nicknamed the Big ‘E,’ was the world’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier when it was commissioned on November 25, 1961.  Likewise, the ship is the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to be scrapped. The Navy is still weighing its options as to what to do with the Big ‘E.’

[The Navy is assessing two options](https://www.wtkr.com/2018/08/07/getting-rid-of-the-former-uss-enterprise-could-cost-the-navy-more-than-1-5-billion/). The first would involve the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Washington state dismantling the section of the ship that contains the eight defueled reactors and all other nuclear-related material.

The shipyard would prepare that material for disposal at a facility in Hanford, Washington. The non-nuclear parts of the Enterprise would then be handled by a commercial company.

Under this plan, the preliminary cost estimates range from $1.05 billion to $1.55 billion, with a 10 year span for the work that wouldn’t begin until 2034.

The second option would involve a commercial company, or several companies, handling the entire process. The cost estimates for that range from $750 million to $1.4 billion, with a five-year span for the work starting in 2024.

The problem is not just the *Enterprise*. When the Navy finally works out the technical issues with the [Ford-class carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_R._Ford-class_aircraft_carrier), it will begin to retire the [Nimitz-class carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier) and will face the same challenges encountered with the *Enterprise*.

“At approximately 76,000 tons, [CVN-65 will require an unprecedented level of work](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/22607/the-navy-could-need-more-than-15-years-and-over-1-5b-to-scrap-uss-enterprise) to dismantle and dispose of as compared to previous ships,” [GAO’s review](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-523), which the congressional office published publicly on Aug. 2, 2018, said. “Regardless of the approach the Navy chooses, CVN-65 will set precedents for the processes, costs, and oversight that may be used to dismantle and dispose of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the future, such as the Nimitz-class carriers which the Navy will begin to retire in the mid-2020s.”
