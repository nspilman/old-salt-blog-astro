Yacht Eos, reported to be similar but smaller than Bezos’ new yacht.

[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-05-07/jeff-bezos-s-new-superyacht-heralds-roaring-market-for-big-boats) is reporting that Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos is spending upwards of $500 million to have a 417 feet (127-meter) long three-masted superyacht built at [Oceano](https://www.oceancoyacht.com/) in the Netherlands.

Few details are available on the newbuilding, but reports are that it will have a second yacht as a tender and that the tender will be large enough to have its own helipad. (It has been suggested that the rigging on the superyacht would interfere with landing a helicopter.)

In terms of size, the new yacht will be roughly twice as long as the [clipper ship *Cutty Sark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark), and, in financial terms, will cost twice what Bezos paid when he purchased the Washington Post newspaper in 2013.

Bezos has an estimated net worth of over $200 billion. Spending half a billion dollars on a superyacht represents one-fourth of one percent of that.

What will Bezos’ superyacht look like? Bloomberg reports that in 2019, Bezos got a taste for the yachting life, vacationing on [*Eos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eos_\(yacht\)), the sailing yacht of friend Barry Diller and his wife, fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg. … Bezos’s sailing yacht will be similar to Diller’s.

The *Eos* is a 305 feet (92.92m) long three-masted Bermuda rigged schooner.
