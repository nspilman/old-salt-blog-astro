On Friday, the “[Christmas Tree Ship](http://christmasship.org/)” arrived again on the Chicago docks, bringing Christmas trees to needy families. The arrival of the ship has become a Chicago holiday tradition, honoring of the memory of Capt Herman Schuenemann and his three masted schooner, the *Rouse Simmons*, known to many as the “Christmas Tree ship,” which delivered Christmas trees to the Chicago Docks for over 30 years around the turn of the 20th century. Starting in 2000, the maritime community of Chicago has revived the tradition. This year, the [US Coast Guard Cutter *Alder*](http://www.uscg.mil/d9/cgcAlder/) arrived at the dock, her decks loaded with trees, which are being distributed to local families over the weekend.
