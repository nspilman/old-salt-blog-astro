![googleseaview](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/11/googleseaview.jpg)Google has now extended its “Street View” imagery to well beyond where the streets and even the dry land ends.  Its new “[Street View – Oceans](https://www.google.com/maps/views/streetview/oceans?gl=us)” lets you virtually dive on the coral reefs of the Bahamas, explore the wreck of the Civil War steamer *Mary Celeste*, swim with Galapagos sea lions, or chase sea turtles off Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef, all without squeezing into a wet suit or even getting wet.  Check it out – but be warned it is easy to get lost in the underwater panoramas.
