The National Park Service has decided to dismantle the 96-year-old steam lumber schooner, *[Wapama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wapama_\(steam_schooner\))*, a [National Historic Landmark](http://www.noehill.com/sf/landmarks/nat1973000228.asp). The ship is the last of  of some 225 steam schooners that served the lumber trade and other coastal services along the Pacific Coast.

*The Wapama, which had a long career carrying lumber on the so-called Redwood Coast of California and Oregon, had been a museum ship at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, but old age and dry rot have apparently brought the vessel to the end of the line.* 

*“She held on pretty well for a long time, but then she started to go, like an elderly relative that took a turn for the worse,” said Robyn Jackson, chief of cultural resources for the maritime park. “But now it’s become terminal.”*

*The 200-foot-long vessel was popular with the public when it first went on display as a museum ship public under auspices of the California State Park system at the Hyde Street pier in 1963.*
