On April 1, [Sarah Young was swept from the cockpit](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/04/second-fatality-clipper-round-world-race/) of the yacht *IchorCoal* sailing in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in the [Clipper Round the Word Race](https://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/). By the time the crew reached her, she had died. She was wearing a life-jacket with an AIS locator device but she had not been tethered to the boat. Many have commented that being tethered might have saved her life.

On the other hand, going overboard without being clipped in is not necessarily a death sentence. In the previous Clipper Race in 2014, [Andrew Taylor, 46, from London, a crew member on *Derry–Londonderry–Doire* yacht fell overboard](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/04/clipper-round-the-world-race-dramatic-man-overboard/) in the Pacific, untethered, and was rescued safely after ninety minutes in the water.

What was different between the two cases? No doubt, many things, including luck. The devil is in the details, as the saying goes, and small differences in conditions and circumstances can mean the difference between life and death.

Unfortunately, being clipped in doesn’t necessarily guarantee safety either. In 2011, [Christopher Reddish, captain of the Reflex 38′*Lion* died](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/sailing/8584195/Yachtsman-dies-after-falling-overboard-in-cross-Channel-race.html) after being washed overboard while working on the foredeck. He was tethered to a jackstay and wore a life jacket. The crew got Reddish back aboard within about 16 minutes, by which time, he had drowned.

[Ben Meakins writing in *Practical Boat Owner*](http://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/is-it-safe-to-use-a-tether-25125) notes, “*The tragic drowning of the skipper of the Reflex 38 Lion 15 miles south of Selsey Bill in 2011 shocked the sailing world. But the subsequent [Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB)](https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/56b4c611e5274a036900000f/MAIBInv4-2012.pdf) report was truly chilling because it emerged that Mr. Christopher Reddish (47) had done everything by the book. He was wearing a lifejacket and he was clipped on with a tether, or safety, line – but when he went overboard from the foredeck on a dark night he was dead by the time the crew could recover him.*”

Unfortunately, the events of the *Lion* are not entirely unique. The MAIB report noted four other cases where sailors tethered to their boats were incapable of getting back aboard, even with crew assistance. In one case, two sailors and the captain were washed off a 35′ yacht after being hit by a swell while entering port.  The sailors were tethered to the boat and subsequently drowned. The captain who was wearing neither a life jacket nor a safety harness survived.

Returning to the tragedy on the *Lion,* if the captain and crew were doing everything right, why did the captain drown? The MAIB noted that the captain was wearing a 1.8-meter long tether. If he had been wearing a shorter tether, he may not have been washed over the side.

Once the captain was washed overboard, why didn’t the tether save him? It appears, tragically, that the tether may have contributed to the drowning.

In August 2015, [Robin Knox-Johnston, Chairman and Founder of the Clipper Round the World Race, invited MAIB and Yachting Monthly](http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/sailing-skills/mob-lifesaving-lessons-learned-at-sea-32278) aboard one of his Clipper 60 cutters, *Black Adder*, to test man-overboard procedures using a life-size dummy.  In a simulation similar to what happened on the *Lion*, the results were grim.

*The dummy was heaved overboard from the foredeck while the boat was sailing at around 4 knots through the water. The tether held the dummy’s head face down, into the boat’s oncoming bow wave. Water would be funnelled directly down the throat, drowning the casualty in a few minutes.*

The situation was not markedly better if the dummy went overboard from the cockpit.

*When the dummy went overboard from the cockpit while the boat was sailing downwind, it was dragged through the boat’s wake, which would soon have caused drowning in a real-life situation.*

The MOB tests done on *Black Adder* are described by Yachting World in *[MOB lifesaving lessons learned at sea](http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/sailing-skills/mob-lifesaving-lessons-learned-at-sea-32278).*  It is well worth reading.

Is all this to say that safety harnesses with tethers should not be used? Of course not. The immediate lessons appear to be that one should keep clipped to the high side when moving about and try to keep the tether as short as is practical.  The goal is to stay aboard the boat at all costs.

The longer term lessons seem to be that more work is needed on man-overboard procedures and training, as well as improved safety gear overall. When sailing offshore, we are not as safe as we might think we are or as we need to be.
