![hmyBritannia](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/hmyBritannia.jpg)[HMY *Britannia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMY_Britannia_\(Royal_Cutter_Yacht\)) was the personal sailing yacht of two British kings. Built in 1893 for Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VII, the *Britannia* would also be sailed by his son, King George V. Designed by the Scottish designer, [George Lennox Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lennox_Watson), the yacht won 231 races and took another 129 flags over her long racing career. The *Britannia* followed King George V to his grave. In accordance with his dying wish, on 10 July 1936, the yacht was stripped of her spars and fittings and her hull towed out to St Catherines Deep near the Isle of Wight where she was scuttled. *Britannia*‘s burgee and racing flag were presented to the [Royal Dorset Yacht Club](http://www.royal-dorset.com/history/4584423947), where they are still on display.
