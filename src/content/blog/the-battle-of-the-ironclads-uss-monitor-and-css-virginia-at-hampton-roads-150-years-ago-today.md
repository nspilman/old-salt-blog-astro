![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/03/monitor-merrimac.jpg)The *[USS Monitor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Monitor)* and the *[CSS Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Virginia)* were not the first iron-clad war ships, but they were the first to face each other in battle. One hundred and fifty years ago today, the two ironclads met in [Hampton Roads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hampton_Roads), VA and fought each other to a draw.  After hours of close range fighting, the *CSS Virginia* retired, having failed to break the Union blockade.  
  
The *CSS Virginia* was built from the scuttled hull of the steam frigate, *USS Merrimack*, which was burned to the waterline at her berth in the Norfolk to prevent her from falling into rebel hands.  From the burned hull, the Confederates fabricated new iron-clad upper works featuring a sloping armored casement, pierced for 12 guns. Renamed the *CSS Virginia*, her construction caused near panic in the Union government and navy.

On March 8, 1962, the fears surrounding the *CSS Virginia* appeared well founded.  The Confederate ironclad rammed and sank the sloop-of-war, *USS Cumberland*, and destroyed the frigate *USS* *Congress* by gun fire. Return fire from the *Cumberland* and the *Congress* bounced off the ironclad’s armored plating*.*

That night the *USS Monitor* arrived in Hampton Roads. The ship was a radical design developed by Swedish engineer and inventor John Ericsson.  Described as looking like a cheese box on a raft,  the *Monitor* featured a steam powered rotating armored gun turret  mounting two 11″ Dalhgren guns.  The ship was low in the water and heavily armored.  The fire from the Virginia never breached the *Monitor*‘s plates. Part way through the battle *Virginia* ceased firing and attempted to ram the *Monitor.*  The *Monitor* however was more maneuverable and  avoided the *Virginia*.  While neither ship was able to defeat the other, fire from the *Monitor* did considerable damage to the *Virginia*‘s armor plate.

This would be the first and last battle for each ship.  In early May, 1862 the *Virginia* was burned by its crew when the city of Norfolk fell. The *Monitor* also was short lived, sinking on December 31, 1862 while under tow off Cape Hatteras in heavy seas.
