![rtxr0ep-1-522x293](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rtxr0ep-1-522x293.jpg)It is being reported that two American security guards, both former Navy SEALs, have been found dead on the *Maersk Alabama* while in Port Victoria, in the Seychelles. The men have been identified as Jeffrey Reynolds and Mark Kennedy, both 44, employees for the Trident Security Firm.  Police said the cause of death will be determined by autopsies.

The *Maersk Alabama* was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. The hijacking and subsequent rescue of the captain by Navy SEALs inspired the movie “*Captain Phillips*,”  starring Tom Hanks. The [*Maersk Alabama*  has been attacked two other times since the hijacking](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/maersk-alabama-attacked-for-the-third-time-will-armed-guards-on-merchant-ships-become-the-norm/), but in both cases the pirates were driven off by security guards on the ship.  Thanks to Phil Leon for contributing to this post.
