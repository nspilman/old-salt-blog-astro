![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sunkennorfrigate.jpg)Overnight, the Norwegian frigate [*Helge Ingstad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNoMS_Helge_Ingstad_\(F313\)) slipped beneath the waters of Hjeltefjord near Bergen, Norway. Last Thursday, [the frigate was intentionally grounded to prevent it from sinking](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/11/tanker-collides-with-norwegian-frigate-frigate-loses/) after it collided with the tanker *Sola TS*. Despite efforts to stabilize the ship with steel cables bolted to rocks on shore, photos issued by the Norwegian Defense show the sunken warship with just her radar mast rising from the water. The frigate was returning from a NATO exercise when she collided with the tanker near a major oil terminal and still has all weapons on board.

KNM *Helge Ingstad* is one of five 5,290 tonne [Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fridtjof_Nansen-class_frigate) built in Spain for the Royal Norwegian Navy. Built in Spain, the *Helge Ingstad* was commissioned in 2009.
