The cruise industry continues to change.  While Boston reported a record number of cruise passengers traveling through its cruise terminal in 2010, the city of Philadelphia is planning on turning its cruise terminal into an an Urban Outfitters retail store, having only two cruise ships scheduled to call on the city during 2011.   Farther south, European and British cruise ships are returning to Cuba after the lifting of a ban on cruise ships by Fidel Castro.   Thanks to [Alaric Brown](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) and Irwin Bryan for passing the article along.
