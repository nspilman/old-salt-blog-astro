Shark attacks are rare. Shark attacks on live television are virtually unprecedented, which is why the video of an encounter between Australian champion surfer, Mick Fanning, and a large shark in the waters off South Africa caught on live TV spread so rapidly across the internet, like chum on the virtual ocean. While competing in the J-Bay Open, viewers were horrified to see a large shark fin suddenly appear next to Fanning, who then a few seconds later appears to be dragged underwater. Amazingly, Fanning fought off the shark and escaped unscathed.  While suffering emotional trauma, Mick Fanning is OK.  If the shark had bitten Fanning, it easily could have been otherwise. When asked what he would say to the shark, Fanning replied, “[Thanks for not eating me!](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/21/mick-fanning-shark-thanks-for-not-eating-me)”

A UK satire site put a slightly took spin on the events, as they reported: [Shark survives attack by Australian surfer](http://newsthump.com/2015/07/20/shark-survives-attack-by-australian-surfer/).

*Shark Simon Williams has spoken of his relief at surviving a potentially life-threatening  encounter with Australian surfer, Mick Fanning.*

*Williams was minding his own business at Jeffreys Bay off the coast of South African, when a chance encounter with professional surfer and full-time Aussie Mick Fanning left him facing a series of potentially lethal blows.*

*He told us, “I was just swimming along thinking about stopping for something to eat when the next thing I know I’m being sucker-punched by this Aussie – right in the small of the back.”*
