Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have spotted [a translucent white octopod](http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/noaa-scientists-find-ghostlike-octopod-hawaii-believe-it-s-new-n532346) at a depth of 4,300 meters while collecting geological samples with a remote-operated vehicle on Necker Ridge in the Hawaiian Archipelago.  Described as a “remarkable little octopod,” the creature which apparently lacks pigment cells, unlike most cephalopods, is believed to be a previously unknown species.
