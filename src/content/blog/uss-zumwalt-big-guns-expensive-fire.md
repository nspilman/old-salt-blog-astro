![zumwalt3](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/11/zumwalt3.jpg)The destroyer [USS *Zumwalt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Zumwalt) was commissioned about three weeks ago. It is the latest and greatest, most high tech destroyer in the fleet. At a cost of around $4 billion dollars, it is also the most expensive destroyer ever built. The ship has two primary guns, 155 mm [Advanced Gun System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Gun_System "Advanced Gun System") howitzers, intended to support ground forces in land attacks. These guns fire a [Long Range Land Attack Projectile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Land_Attack_Projectile) (LRLAP), a GPS guided round with a range of 60 nautical miles.  

The only problem is that the Navy just announced that they are cancelling the high-tech ammunition because each LRLAP is simply too expensive to fire. Each LRLAP costs around $800,000, and quite possibly more. According to [Popular Mechanics](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a23738/uss-zumwalt-ammo-too-expensive/): *The two Advanced Gun System howitzers are fed by a magazine containing 600 rounds of ammunition, making it capable destroying hundreds of targets at a rate of up to ten per minute.* 

If you do the math the numbers get scary. If the guns fire 10 LRLAP rounds per minute from a 600 round magazine, the ammunition alone would cost $480,000,000 per hour, or almost a half billion dollars. One source suggests that the ship could carry up to 1,500 rounds, which would represent roughly 30% of the construction cost of the ship itself, just for ammunition.

The Navy blames this exorbitant cost on the earlier budget cuts. Originally, the Navy planned on building 32 Zumwalt class destroyers, a number that they have now cut to 3.  The smaller ship order also meant fewer LRLAPs on order and presumably dramatically decreased economies of scale. Even so, the cost appear to have escalated extremely rapidly. In 2001, the director of Lockheed’s guided projectiles division claimed the LRLAP would cost “[less than $50,000 each](http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2001/March/Pages/Naval_Guns7095.aspx).”

So the new ship has big guns, but no bullets. The Navy is now looking for new ammunition. 

[Defense News](http://www.defensenews.com/articles/new-warships-big-guns-have-no-bullets) reports: *“We are looking at multiple different rounds for that gun,” the Navy official said, adding that “three or four different rounds” have been looked at, including the Army’s Excalibur munition from Raytheon, and the Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP), a project under development by the Office of Naval Research and BAE Systems.*

*“There are multiple companies that have looked at alternatives to get the cost down and use that delivery system,” the Navy official said.*

*But the likelihood is that there will be no LRLAP replacement before the Zumwalt enters operational service.*
