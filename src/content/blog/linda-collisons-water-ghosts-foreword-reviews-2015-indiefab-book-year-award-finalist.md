In our [review from last May](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/05/water-ghosts-by-linda-collison-a-review/) we wrote: In Linda Collison’s new novel, *Water Ghosts*, seven troubled teenagers embark on a vintage Chinese junk on a Pacific “adventure-therapy” voyage, to either help them work out their problems or just possibly to get them out of their parents’ hair. …

*Water Ghosts* is an absolutely gripping paranormal nautical adventure. While intended for young adults, it can be enjoyed by readers of all ages. Highly recommended.
