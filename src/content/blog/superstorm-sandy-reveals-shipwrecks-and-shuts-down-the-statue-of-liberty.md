In New York harbor, the [Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are closed](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-storm-sandy-libertybre8ab16k-20121112,0,2559396.story) while storm damage is being assessed.   Fortunately the statue itself suffered no damage but the facilities, including docks, offices and even brick walkways were significantly damaged. The Statue of Liberty had been closed for a year for renovations prior to the storm and had only been opened for six hours prior to Sandy sweeping into the harbor.  Ellis Island’s invaluable cache of historical documents and records was not harmed by the storm, but there was considerable damage to docks and buildings reported.
