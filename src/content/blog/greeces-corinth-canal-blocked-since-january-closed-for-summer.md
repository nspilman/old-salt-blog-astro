![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/corinthcanal.jpg)The [Corinth Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth_Canal) that connects the Gulf of Corinth in the Ionian Sea with the Saronic Gulf in the Aegean Sea, was closed by a landslide in January. It was recently announced that the [canal will remain closed to marine traffic](https://www.theca.org.uk/news/med/corinth-canal-closure-2021-season) until the end of the summer 2021 season with a probable extension. 

With the four-mile-long sea-level canal through the Isthmus of Corinth closed, vessels that would otherwise use the canal must travel 185 nautical miles around the Peloponnese. 

The canal is too small for most modern cargo vessels with a maximum allowed beam of 58 feet and a maximum draft of 24 feet. 

The idea to dig a canal across the Isthmus of Corinth dates back to at least 700 BCE. The Roman emperors Julius Caesar, Caligula, and Nero were each involved in failed projects to build the canal. The modern canal was begun in 1881 and was officially opened in July of 1893. 

The canal’s steep limestone walls have resulted in chronic landslides. Although the canal was opened in July 1893, it was not opened to navigation until the following November, due to falling rocks. 

Here is a short video showing the extent of the recent canal blockage.
