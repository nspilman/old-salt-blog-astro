![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/09/bluenoseiilaunch.jpg)The schooner Bluenose II has been launched in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia.  The local news outlets referred to the event as the “relaunching” of the schooner though as the hull was completely replaced and only some portion of the Douglas fir deck was re-used, it is effectively a newly built vessel.  The Bluenose II is a replica of the original Bluenose, a Grand Banks fishing schooner famous for its graceful lines and speed under sail.   See our previous post, *[The Schooner Bluenose II and the Ax that Never Wears Out](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/05/19/the-ax-that-never-wears-out-and-the-schooner-bluenose-ii/)*

*Some are calling her Bluenose 2½.* 

*Its two masts, canvas sails and rigging – to be installed after the vessel is launched – were taken from the first version of Bluenose II, built in 1963 by the Oland family of Halifax to promote sales of Schooner beer.*

*Even though the rebuilt vessel shares the same name and overall look as the Olands’ reproduction, it is a substantially different craft.*

*While the hull of the Oland Bluenose was made from red oak and pine – as was the original Bluenose – the newer edition is sheathed in angelique imported from South America.* 

*The russet-coloured wood is renowned for its strength and resistance to rot and termite-like creatures known as marine borers. It is also very dense and can be difficult to work with.*

Thanks to Phil Leon for passing along the news.
