*One of the UK’ss most important historic steam ships has launched and appeal for survival, amid ongoing concerns that Britain’s maritime heritage is in decline.*

*Registered charity The Solent Steam Packet today launched an emergency appeal for £80,000 to secure the future of SS Shieldhall, a unique and historic steam-driven cargo and passenger ship based at the port of Southampton UK. SS Shieldhall is one of a small number of vessels forming the UK’s National Historic Ships Fleet and was named ‘Flagship of the National Historic Ships Fleet’ in 2009 by the National Historic Ships Unit, making her officially recognised as being of preeminent national or regional importance.*

*In spring 2011, the hugely popular heritage steamship Shieldhall, owned by charity preservation group The Solent Steam Packet Ltd, must undertake dry-docking at an estimated cost of £80,000 to £100,000. Without this she cannot continue to sail and would be at risk of being scrapped in the near future. SS Shieldhall is operated entirely by unpaid volunteers who are now looking for help funding this essential work which will allow the vessel to keep a valid passenger certificate and continue to delight the thousands of people who visit and travel on her each year.*
