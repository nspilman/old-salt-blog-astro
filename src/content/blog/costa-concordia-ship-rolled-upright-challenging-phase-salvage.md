This was the most perilous phase of the salvage of the wrecked cruise ship, [*Costa Concordia*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/thousands-evacuated-as-cruise-ship-costa-concordia-strikes-reef-off-italy-at-least-three-dead/).  The parbuckle rolling of the ship upright was where everything could go wrong.  The biggest concern was that the stress would break the already damaged ship apart. Nevertheless, despite going somewhat slower than originally planned, the operation was a success.  The ship is upright again.  It will take several months before the ship is ready to be towed away to the scrap yard.  Below, a time-lapse video of the salvage, the 19 hour process reduced to about a minute.
