Lieutenant-Commander Tony Bentley-Buckle, who died at the end of May at the age of 88, had a valiant and varied career in the Royal Navy during World War II.  After the war, he established two shipping lines and an airline in Africa and competed in the Olympics for Kenya.  Despite this impressive career, he may be best remembered for his time spent in a German POW camp as one of the creators of  “Albert RN,”  a life sized dummy, used to facilitate prisoner escapes.

*Bentley-Buckle was the camp’s watch repairer and lock picker, and he made the mechanism which enabled Albert’s eyes to blink and move, giving added realism to the dummy. In 1953 a highly fictionalised version of the episode was made into a film, Albert RN, but Bentley-Buckle’s true wartime adventures, behind enemy lines in Italy and Yugoslavia, were even stranger than fiction.* [Read the rest of the obituary](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/naval-obituaries/7982962/Lieutenant-Commander-Tony-Bentley-Buckle.html).
