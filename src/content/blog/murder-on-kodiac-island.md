![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Kodiakislandmap.jpg)This sounds like the teaser from a thriller or murder mystery. Unfortunately, it is all too real.  Last Thursday, shortly after 7 AM, coworkers found the bodies of [US Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Jim Hopkins and retired Boatswain Mate Chief Rich Belisle](http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-coast-guard-shooting-20120413,0,3449272.story), working as a civilian contractor, at their stations at Coast Guard Communications Station Kodiak on Kodiak Island, Alaska.  Both men had been shot dead. The station is a high security area, responsible for radio communications across the North Pacific and Bering Sea.

As the killings took place on federal property, the FBI has jurisdiction and is being assisted by military police, the Coast Guard Investigative Service and the Alaska State Troopers.  Beyond ruling the deaths as homicides, the FBI has said very little about the case thus far.  
  
Day before yesterday, there was a memorial service for for the victims.  [According to press reports](http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/6b02314bc18b4479829b58a857fc2294/AK--Coast-Guard-Shooting/), over 900 people attended, an impressive turnout for an island with 6,000 civilians and 7,000 military personnel.
