![Windmills](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Windmills.jpg)New energy is coming to Fukushima, the region in Japan best known for a nuclear disaster following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of 11 March 2011. The [nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster) was largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl meltdown of 1986, and only the second to measure Level 7 on the [International Nuclear Event Scale.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale)   Now, the world’s largest wind farm is set to begin construction this July, 16 kilometers off the coast of Fukushima.  The offshore wind farm will comprise 143 wind turbines capable of generating 1 gigawatt of electrical power.  The wind farm is part of Fukushima’s plan to become completely energy self-sufficient by 2040, using renewable sources alone.  The  prefecture also plans to build [Japan’s largest solar energy park](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528764.800-japan-could-become-second-biggest-solar-power-nation.html).

The [Greater Gabbard farm off the coast of Suffolk, UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Gabbard_wind_farm) is currently the world’s largest offshore wind farm with 140 turbines generating 540 megawatts of power.
