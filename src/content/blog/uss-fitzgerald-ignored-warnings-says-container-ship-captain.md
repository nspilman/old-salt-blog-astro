![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fitzgerald2.jpg)The [captain of *ACX Crystal* has said that the USS *Fitzgerald*](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-navy-asia-exclusive-idUSKBN19H13C) “suddenly” steamed on to a course to cross the path of the container ship and then failed to respond to warning signals or take evasive action to avoid the collision, which killed seven of the *Fitzgerald*‘s crew. The container ship steered hard to starboard to avoid the warship, but hit the *Fitzgerald* 10 minutes later at 1:30 a.m., according to a copy of Captain Ronald Advincula’s report to Japanese ship owner Dainichi Investment Corporation that was [seen by Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-navy-asia-exclusive-idUSKBN19H13C). 

The U.S. Navy declined to comment and there is no independent confirmation of the account. There are now at least six ongoing  investigations into the [collision which took place in clear weather south of Tokyo Bay](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/06/destroyer-uss-fitzgerald-collides-container-ship-seven-missing/) in the early hours of June 17.  The [U.S. Navy has announced that Rear Adm. Brian Fort](https://news.usni.org/2017/06/23/former-destroyer-commander-to-lead-uss-fitzgerald-collision-investigation?utm_source=USNI+News&utm_campaign=3b06b93e01-USNI_NEWS_DAILY&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0dd4a1450b-3b06b93e01-231629009&ct=t\(USNI_NEWS_DAILY\)&mc_cid=3b06b93e01&mc_eid=6b13337ad4), formerly the commander of USS *Gonzalez* (DDG-66) and Destroyer Squadron 26, will head up one of the two Navy investigations into the collision.
