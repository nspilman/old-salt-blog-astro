![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/moby-dick-full-3.jpg)The New York Marathon was cancelled after Superstorm Sandy swept through New York two weeks ago. The New York Moby Dick Marathon is on, however.

What is a Moby Dick Marathon, you might ask?  It is ” *the first-ever marathon-style reading in New York City of Herman Melville’s American classic, Moby-Dick, Or, the Whale. Celebrating the anniversary of the novel’s publication in the United States on November 14, 1851, the inaugural NYC marathon will span three days, three bookstores, and two boroughs, featuring over 100 readers*.”

The Marathon kicks off at 5PM on Friday, November 16 and runs through 4PM Sunday, November 18.  Click here to learn more – [Moby Dick Marathon NYC](http://mobydickmarathonnyc.org/).

The Moby Dick Marathon NYC should not be confused with the [Moby Dick Big Read](http://www.mobydickbigread.com/), in which actors and writers have been reading a chapter a day from Moby Dick and posting the chapters on-line as pod casts.
