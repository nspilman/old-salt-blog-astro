![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/12/cuttysarknew_pa.jpg)After being gutted by fire in 2007, the 1869 composite tea clipper *[Cutty Sark](http://www.cuttysark.org.uk/)* has been undergoing a methodical reconstruction.  She reached a milestone recently when her foremast was restepped in the ship.  The main and mizzen masts are expected to be stepped this weekend. The *Cutty Sark* is a composite ship in that she has wooden planking but iron frames and keel.  Ironically, the ship was almost destroyed during a restoration project when an industrial vacuum cleaner caught fire. The *Cutty Sark* will be officially reopened by the Queen in late April.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.php) for passing the news along.
