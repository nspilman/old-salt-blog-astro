![ohpstern](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/01/ohpstern.jpg)It doesn’t feel very much like summer right now, but at least we are on the far side of the winter solstice, so each day brings spring a bit closer.  And this spring, the Oliver Hazard Perry, the first ocean-going full-rigged ship to be built in America in over a century will begin sailing. The OHPRI organization has announced summer camp programs on the new sailing school ship.  From their [press release](http://www.ohpri.org/news-details/summer-camps-for-teens-aboard-an-extraordinary-tall-ship-200-foot-sailing-school-vessel-provides-edu):

*Teens from around the country and the world will board in July and August for thrilling one- and two-week Education at Sea camps. The 200-foot Sailing School Vessel (SSV) Oliver Hazard Perry, hailing from Newport, R.I., has a 500-ton steel hull and a 130-foot tall rig with square sails on all three masts. She will have a captain, officers, a cook, an engineer and a dozen other professional crew members, but the balance of her crew will be none other than the students themselves – after all, she is a Sailing School Vessel.*

*[Registration for camp is now open to the public](http://www.ohpri.org/teen-summer-camp). The seven weeks of camp will take place this summer, allowing teens to become part of the exciting and highly-structured environment of a sailing ship. (For the remainder of the year, SSV Oliver Hazard Perry will serve as the platform for programs with schools, universities, scientists, and other partners.)*

*“They’ll learn to haul lines, hoist yards, climb the rigging, tie knots, keep lookout, and even steer at the helm, along with other seamanship skills,” says Captain Richard Bailey, who has been commanding Tall Ships and working with youth aboard them for decades, “but most important, they’ll learn to be good shipmates, and good citizens of their greater world.”*
