More than 4,000 people have climbed Mount Everest. More than 600 people have been in outer space. Yet fewer than 100 people have sailed solo non-stop around the world.

What does it take to race around the globe alone? Skill, obviously. Physical strength, absolutely. Mental stamina, however, may be the most difficult part of the voyage. In the video below [Alex Thomson](https://www.alexthomsonracing.com/) describes the techniques he uses to stay focused in racing around the world in the Vendee Globe. Fascinating and useful even for those of who do not race at 40 knots across the Southern Ocean.
