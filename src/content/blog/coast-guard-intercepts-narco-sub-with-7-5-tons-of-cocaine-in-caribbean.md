*The Coast Guard caught a narco submarine trying to smuggle $180 million worth of cocaine into the U.S., intercepting the drug vessel as her own crew tried to sink her off the coast of Honduras.*

*Coast Guard video shows the crew of the semi-submersible craft jumping off the boat and into a yellow life raft. As a Coast Guard boat comes alongside, the submarine can be seen quickly sinking into the Caribbean.*
