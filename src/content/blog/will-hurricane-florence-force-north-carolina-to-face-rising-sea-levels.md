![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hflorence.jpg)In 2010, a North Carolina state commission report predicted that sea levels on the state’s coast could rise as much as 39 inches by the year 2100, flooding billions of dollars’ worth of real estate and crippling much of the state’s economy. Instead of taking action to mitigate the damage, the [state legislature passed laws in 2012](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-florence-north-carolina-passed-law-in-2012-climate-change-storms-more-damaging/) saying that the new predictions could not be used for public planning. Only historical data could be used, seriously underestimating the effects of climate change. The [politicians effectively chose to support development rather than science](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/us/north-carolina-coast-hurricane.html). In the meantime, the population on the North Carolina coast is growing rapidly, increasing by half in the last two decades. 

North Carolina is not alone. The administration of Gov. Rick Scott of Florida has discouraged even the use of terms like “climate change” and “global warming” in official communications. The current occupant of the Oval Office calls climate change a “hoax.”

Orrin H. Pilkey, a retired Duke University coastal geologist, wrote in an essay titled, “Sea-level rise is here. North Carolina needs to act” in the [News & Observer](https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/article217954910.html), “We must take the long view and respond now to the rising sea in a planned fashion. Currently, the unspoken plan is to wait until the situation is catastrophic and then respond.” 

Now, Hurricane Florence is battering the Carolina coast. Major, perhaps catastrophic, flooding is expected. The extent of the damage from the storm could be historically horrific. Will Hurricane Florence be enough to force North Carolinian politicians to face the reality of climate change and take action?
