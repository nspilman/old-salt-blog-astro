*Olson’s tall ship for San Francisco will embrace the design and construction methods developed by Matthew Turner, a founding member of the San Francisco Yacht Club. Considered the most prolific boat builder on the Pacific coast and the San Francisco area, Turner built 228 sailing ships between 1864 and 1908, partnering with companies like Spreckels Sugar, C&H Sugar and Matson Lines.* 

*They weren’t clunky old boats but highly sophisticated, fast and able commercial vessels capable of making trips to Hawaii in just nine days.*

*“There’s an historical connection and we want to show how shipping and boat building of that era was very significant,” Olson said.* 

*With sustainability in mind, Bauer described the unique “green” propulsion system that will be used. It can produce the majority of the ship’s propulsion and electrical needs through electric motors that turn into generators once under sail.*

*“It’ll have twin propellers and electric motors that propel it,” Bauer said. “Under sail, when water passes by the props, it generates electricity. At high speeds we can generate significant amounts of energy that can be stored in batteries on board. We don’t believe anyone else has really done this before.”*
