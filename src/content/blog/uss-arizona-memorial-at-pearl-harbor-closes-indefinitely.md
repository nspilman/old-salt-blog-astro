The monument is only accessible by shuttle boats and averages over one million visitors per year. The [National Park Service issued a statement](https://www.facebook.com/ValorNPS/posts/1805621372828424):

*Due to a critical structural and safety issue impacting the USS Arizona Memorial dock and visitor loading ramp, the Memorial will remain closed to visitation for an undetermined period of time while repairs are made*….

*Following several weeks of analysis and continued consultation with structural engineers, the NPS has determined that what originally seemed to be a minor repair process, is, in fact, more significant than originally anticipated. The amount of time needed to implement the repairs is unknown, but the NPS will continue to provide information to the public as our team of specialists works together to restore access as soon as possible.*

While the repairs are underway, other programs and services will still be available to guests including a 25-minute documentary film and a harbor tour of Battleship Row in close proximity to the USS Arizona Memorial.

The memorial marks the resting place of 1,102 of the 1,177 sailors and Marines killed on USS Arizona (BB-39) during the [Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor) on December 7, 1941.
