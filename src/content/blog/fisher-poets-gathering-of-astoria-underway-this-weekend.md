![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/02/fisherpoets.jpg)The [15th Annual Fisher Poets Gathering](http://www.clatsopcc.edu/about-ccc/press-releases/2012-fisherpoets-gathering) is underway in Astoria, Oregon.  As the name suggests, it is a gathering where poets of the sea swap verse, music and stories.  Men and women tied to the fishing industry share original poems, stories, songs, memoirs, essays and art in celebration of the work, its people and their concerns.  The gathering runs through tomorrow at [Clatsop Community College](http://www.clatsopcc.edu/community/fisherpoets-gathering).  Thanks to Darren O’Brien for pointing it out.
