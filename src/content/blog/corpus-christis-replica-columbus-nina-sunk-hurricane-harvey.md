![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ninasunk.jpg)The last of Corpus Christi’s Columbus replica ships has sunk. In 1992, the quincentenary of Columbus’ first voyage, replicas of his ships; the [*Niña*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C3%B1a), [*Pinta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinta_\(ship\)) and the [Santa Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Mar%C3%ADa_\(ship\)); arrived in Corpus Christi, Texas after sailing from Spain and touring the US East Coast. The ships were donated to the city. The *Santa Maria* and the *Pinta* were [broken up in 2014](http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Columbus-replica-ships-torn-up-5683531.php). The *Niña* remained afloat at a dock behind [behind Joe’s Crab Shack](http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/25690). Or at least she was afloat until Hurricane Harvey came calling, when the [*Niña* began taking on water](http://www.kristv.com/story/36237354/nina-taking-on-water-in-corpus-christi-bay) and sank.  [Click here for more photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/jwQnQ). 

Corpus Christi’s *Niña* is not the only replica of the ship now sailing. The [Michigan Maritime Museum](http://www.michiganmaritimemuseum.org/) in South Haven, MI will be hosting [The Columbus Society](http://www.thenina.com/index.html)‘s replica *Niña* and [*Pinta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinta_\(ship\)) over the Labor Day Weekend.
