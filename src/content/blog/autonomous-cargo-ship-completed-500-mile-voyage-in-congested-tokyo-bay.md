![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/orcaai.jpg)In January, we [posted about the successful test demonstration](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/01/nippon-foundations-meguri-2040-project-demonstrates-autonomous-car-ferry/) of the world’s first fully autonomous ship navigation systems on a large car ferry on a 240-km route from Shinmoji (Northern Kyushu) to Iyonada, Japan.

Now, [​​Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha](https://www.nyk.com/english/profile/) (NYK Line), partnering with Israeli based software platform designers, [Orca AI](https://www.orca-ai.io/), has demonstrated an autonomous 750 gross-ton commercial cargo ship, *Suzaka*, on a 40 hour, 500-mile voyage in the congested waters of Tokyo Bay, traveling without human intervention for 99% of the trip.   

During *Suzaka*’s 500-mile voyage, [the autonomous cargo ship performed 107 collision avoidance maneuvers](https://electrek.co/2022/05/13/autonomous-cargo-ship-completes-500-mile-voyage-avoiding-hundreds-of-collisions/) without the help of a human. The program director suggests that Suzaka avoided between 400-500 other vessels on the water during its outbound trip alone.

According to Orca AI, its safety navigation system was set up on the cargo ship to operate as a “human watchkeeper,” providing real-time detection, tracking, classification, and range estimation on eighteen onboard cameras, combined to provide a 360° view, day and night.
