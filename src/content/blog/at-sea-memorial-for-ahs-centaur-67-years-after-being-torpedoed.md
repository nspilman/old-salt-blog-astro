*One is the day when, at age 10, he was told two of his brothers were missing presumed drowned after the Centaur hospital ship was torpedoed off the Queensland coast during World War II.*

*And yesterday, for the first time in 67 years, he and his family could pay a proper farewell to Paul and John Bracken by joining an at-sea memorial service at the exact location where the hospital ship lay more than 2000 metres beneath.*
