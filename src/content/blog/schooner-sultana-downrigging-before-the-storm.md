![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sultanadownrigging.jpg)The annual [Sultana Projects](http://sultanaprojects.org/) [Downrigging Weekend](http://sultanaprojects.org/downrigging/), now in its twelfth year, is one of the largest annual tall ship and wooden boat festivals on the East Coast.  The [Downrigging Weekend](http://sultanaprojects.org/downrigging/) is described as “a celebration of maritime culture, wooden boats, and everything else that makes the Chesapeake Bay great.”  A fleet of tall ships is  participating in addition to the schooner [*Sultana*](http://sultanaprojects.org/schoonersultana.htm) including the schooner [*Pride of Baltimore*](http://www.pride2.org/), the historical replica [*Kalmar Nyckel*](http://www.kalmarnyckel.org/), the schooner [*Lady Maryland*](http://www.livingclassrooms.org/Facilities/LadyMD.html), the skipjack [*Elsworth*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsworth_\(skipjack\)), the schooner [*A.J. Meerwald*](http://www.ajmeerwald.org/) and the skipjack [*Sigsbee.*](http://www.livingclassrooms.org/Facilities/Sigsbee.html)

Adding a bit of spice to the weekend is [Tropical Storm Sandy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/sandy-a-hurricane-on-approach-to-jamaica-odds-of-east-coast-impact-grow/2012/10/24/6c35755a-1de7-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_blog.html) which is making its way north.  So far the forecasts suggest that the Downrigging Weekend will be fine, though no doubt everyone will be keeping an eye out to weather.
