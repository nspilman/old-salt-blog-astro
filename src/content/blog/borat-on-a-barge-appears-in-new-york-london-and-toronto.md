![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/boratbarge.jpg)Back in 2013, we posted about a [large inflatable rubber duck](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/06/spreading-joy-around-the-world-aka-rubber-duck-inflated-deflated-revived-censored/) that was visiting ports around the globe. It was created by the Dutch artist [Florentijn Hofman](http://www.florentijnhofman.nl/dev/)  and was named “Spreading Joy Around the World.”  Nevertheless, it was universally known simply as “Rubber Duck.”

Seven years later, we have [Borat on a barge](https://screenrant.com/borat-2-movie-40-foot-naked-inflatables/), an inflatable 40′ long scantily-clad figure of Sacha Baron Cohen’s character, Borat, reclining on a deck barge. And there is not one inflated Borat, but three. Last Thursday and Friday, inflatable nearly-naked Borats appeared reclining on deck barges on [New York City’s Hudson River](https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMediaBoat/photos/pcb.3590875034292504/3590874944292513/), at [Toronto’s Harborfront](https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/inflatable-borat-takes-over-torontos-harbourfont) and in the [Thames River near London Bridge](https://screenrant.com/borat-2-movie-40-foot-naked-inflatables/).

If the inflatable Rubber Duck was a honey bee meant to spread joy, Borat on a barge is a murder hornet meant to promote a movie. All so perfectly emblematic of the year 2020.
