![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/03/kayakcollision.jpg)On August 30, 2016, just before 6PM, [a commuter ferry collided with a group of nine kayakers](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/08/ferry-collides-group-kayakers-hudson-river/), shortly after departing from the [NY Waterway](http://www.nywaterway.com/) terminal at 39th Street on the Hudson River in Manhattan. Four of the kayakers were injured included the group guide who suffered a nearly severed arm. Now, the Coast Guard’s report on the accident concludes that blame for the accident was shared by all parties.

The Coast Guard faulted the kayakers, a group organized and led by Manhattan Kayak Company, for a lack of communication with the ferry operators, NY Waterway. The Coast Guard determined that Manhattan Kayak Company acted negligently “by not taking action early in the trip to avoid collision and not notifying ferry operator they would be traveling in the area.” The leader of the group of kayakers did not have a marine radio, so did not have the means to make the ferry captain aware of their presence. 

The Coast Guard also faulted the captain of the ferry, *Jersey City*, who was blinded by sun glare at the time of the accident and could not see the group of kayakers. The report concluded that “the vessel captain did not maintain a safe speed or a lookout once the sun glare existed and was also at fault in the incident.”

The area in which the collision took place is particularly congested. The West Midtown Ferry Terminal at Piers 78 and 79 is used by NY Waterway ferries and is one of the busier terminals on the Hudson, while three block away, Circle line boats operate from Pier 83. Pier 84, only one block away, is the largest public pier on the Hudson and was designed to allow for human powered craft — kayaks and rowboats. Manhattan Kayak Company operates from Pier 84.
