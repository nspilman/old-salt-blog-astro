I am a big fan of cormorants. The ones I am most familiar with are the double crested cormorants common in North America.  The [imperial shag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Shag) cormorant, the double crested cormorants’ larger South American and Antarctic cousin, has been causing quite a stir of late. Scientists in Argentina recently attached a lipstick-size video camera to an imperial cormorant’s back and recorded footage of the bird diving 150 feet (46 meters) to the seafloor to catch a fish. No one thought that cormorants could dive that deep.  Some researchers are now calling the imperial shag – “superbirds.”
