As the problem of trash and plastic in our waters gets worse, new (and a few older technologies) are being used to respond. They range from small and functional, like the [Seabin](http://seabinproject.com/the-product/), a sort of high tech floating bucket designed to collect floating trash in marinas, to [RanMarine](https://www.ranmarine.io/aquadrones)‘s [Waste Shark](https://www.popsci.com/waste-shark-is-garbage-collecting-sea-drone), an autonomous surface drone which the developers describe as “trash-eating, data-collecting, carbon-zero and safe.”

“With our system all sizes of rubbish, from huge fishing nets to deadly micro particles, can be swept or sucked up, ground down and stored in SeaVax’s tanks,” explains [project director Chris Close](https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/638166/New-cleaner-SeaVax-has-solution-to-ocean-plastic-waste?platform=hootsuite).

The Waste Shark and the SeaVax are both catamaran designs intended to scoop up plastic and debris from harbors and oceans. Both are relatively high tech and sophisticated. Nevertheless, the concept is not new. In New York harbor, a 100′ long catamaran vessel has been scooping up debris from the water around 70 years.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Drift Collection Vessel DCV *Driftmaster* has helped keep New York harbor and the Hudson River navigable by removing all manner of flotsam and jetsom which would otherwise threaten vessels operating on the waterway. *Driftmaster* has been operating in the harbor since 1948 and is still going strong.
