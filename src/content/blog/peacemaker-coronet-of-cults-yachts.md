[![peacemaker](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/peacemaker.jpg)](Peacemaker)For the past fifteen years, the three masted barquentine motorsailer *[Peacemaker](http://www.peacemakermarine.com/)* has been owned by the [Twelve Tribes](http://twelvetribes.com/), a religious community, often referred to as a cult. The 158′ Class A “tall ship” served as floating ambassador for the fundamentalist group, which has 50 or so communities in North and South America, Europe, and Australia. *Peacemaker* is now [for sale for around $3 million](http://www.northropandjohnson.com/yachts-for-sale/3122-peacemaker/). (Please, do not contact us. We have no involvement in the vessel. )

Originally named *Avany*, the ship was built by the Maccarini shipyard in southern Brazil using traditional methods and tropical ironwood, and was launched in 1989. In 2000, the ship was purchased by the Twelve Tribes and rigged as a barquentine. The refit vessel set sail for the first time in the spring of 2007, under the name *Peacemaker.*

Coronet 1885

The [broker for Northrop and Johnson](http://www.northropandjohnson.com/yachts-for-sale/3122-peacemaker/), the group handling the sale, is based in Newport, Rhode Island. Also in Newport, the classic 131-foot schooner *[Coronet](http://iyrs.edu/our-boats/coronet/)* is now being restored at the International Yacht Restoration School,  [IYRS](http://iyrs.edu/).  *Coronet* also has a long history of ownership by a religious cult.

Launched in 1885, the *Coronet* was one of the most elegant sailing yachts of her day featuring a marble staircase, stained glass doors, mahogany paneled staterooms, and a piano in the main salon.  She was also well known as a successful ocean racer.  *Coronet* was designed by William Townsend and built for Rufus T. Bush by the [C. & R. Poillon shipyard](http://www.aquanaut.plus.com/html/the_boatyard.html) in Brooklyn.

After Rufus Bush’s death in 1890, *Coronet* passed through six owners before being purchased in 1905 for $10,000 by [The Kingdom](http://strangemaine.blogspot.com/2008/05/maines-cult-history-kingdom.html), a religious organization founded by [Frank Sandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sandford).  The Kingdom was an apocalyptic Christian sect and Sanford identified himself with the biblical Elijah and David.  With a crew of thirty, Sandford circumnavigated the globe on *Coronet.*  The intent was to spread the message of the group and yet, strangely, no one went ashore.  Sandford attempted to “subdue the world for Christ” by prayer and to claim nations for Christ by sounding brass instruments as they passed by the shores.  The voyage of the *Coronet* ended badly when Sandford listened to divine instruction to keep sailing, even after supplies had run out. Six crew members died of scurvy and Sandford was sent to prison for manslaughter.

After the voyage, The Kingdom kept the yacht moored at Portland, Maine and owned her until 1995, when she was acquired by the International Yacht Restoration School.

While the Twelve Tribes community has been charged with being a [cult in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Tribes_communities#Police_raids_in_Germany) and France and has battled charges of [child abuse and violating child labor laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Tribes_communities#Commentary_on_the_Island_Pond_raid) in the United States, the reports on the operation of *Peacemaker* have been generally positive.  At least, no one is known to have died of scurvy.
