The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is increasing the size of the [Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary](http://thunderbay.noaa.gov/) in Lake Huron from 448 square miles to 4,300 square miles, doubling the number the number of shipwrecks protected to 200. Located in northwestern Lake Huron, Thunder Bay is adjacent to one of the most treacherous stretches of water within the Great Lakes system. Unpredictable weather, murky fog banks, sudden gales, and rocky shoals earned the area the name “Shipwreck Alley.”  Thunder Bay is the only Marine Sanctuary in fresh water.

[From the NOAA press reelase](http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/news/press/2014/pr090514.html): *Designated in 2000, Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, headquartered in Alpena, Michigan, is one of 14 sites managed by NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, and the only one in the Great Lakes. Co-managed by NOAA and the state of Michigan, Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary has become an important part of the regional economy. Through increased tourism and related business development, the sanctuary is working with various partners to encourage sustainable tourism and foster greater awareness of the Great Lakes and their rich maritime heritage.*

*Thunder Bay features some of the world’s best-preserved shipwrecks, and visitors can explore these underwater sites first-hand through diving, snorkeling and kayaking. Drawing more than 80,000 visitors annually, the sanctuary’s Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Center, also in Alpena, features more than 10,000 square feet of interactive exhibits and has become a major tourism destination in the region.*
