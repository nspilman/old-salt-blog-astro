It is remarkable how little we really know about orcas, also known as killer whales. In January, a team of NOAA scientists located and began to study a likely new species of orca about 60 miles off the coast of Cape Horn, Chile, at the very tip of South America. The species referred to as Type D, looks quite different from other orcas, with a more rounded head, a pointier and narrower dorsal fin, and a very small white eye patch.

The Type D was type D killer whales, were previously known from amateur photographs, fishermen’s descriptions, and one mass stranding—but never encountered in their natural state by cetacean experts.
