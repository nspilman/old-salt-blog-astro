Rendering of the USS Hornet

The [Naval Heritage Society](http://www.navalheritage.org/) is attempting to to build a full-scale, fully functional replica of of the *[USS Hornet](http://www.navalheritage.org/hornets_history.aspx),* a sloop of war built in 1805, which had a successful career in the War of 1812 and beyond, before being lost in a hurricane in 1829.  NHS is endeavoring to raise $12.6 million to fund the project and hopes to lay the keel for replica on July 4th of 2012.  [Melbourne Smith](http://www.navalheritage.org/msmith.aspx), the lead designer for the project, was involved in the design of the [1812 privateer *Lynx*](http://www.privateerlynx.com/) and the [brig *Niagara*](http://flagshipniagara.org/flagship_niagara/index.htm), as well as *[Pride of Baltimore](http://www.pride2.org/index.php)*, *[Spirit of Massachusetts](http://www.oceanclassroom.org/index.php?Itemid=42&id=19&option=com_content&task=view)* and as an advisor to the replica of Captain Cook’s [bark Endeavor](http://www.hmbarkendeavour.co.uk/).  The project Master Shipbuilder, [William Elliott](http://www.navalheritage.org/welliott.aspx), is widely experienced in wooden ship construction and repair including the  the complete reconstruction of the three masted schooner [CA Thayer](http://www.nps.gov/safr/historyculture/c-a-thayer.htm) for the National Park Service, construction of the [brig Niagara](http://flagshipniagara.org/flagship_niagara/index.htm) for the State of Pennsylvania, and construction of the schooner *[Californian](http://www.sdmaritime.org/californian/)*. He also conducted major planking and caulking overhauls of six wooden [MSO class minesweepers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggressive_class_minesweeper) for the U.S. Navy.

*During the War of 1812 this “vicious little ship” gained a reputation for “speedily running her challengers under”. In the entire conflict, she is one of only two vessels whose commanders were awarded Congressional Gold Medals for multiple victories – the other being the legendary USS Constitution herself.* 

*But victory at sea is only a part of this ship’s amazing story. Through feats of seamanship, daring and perseverance, Hornet’s crew built a heritage of excellence that has resonated through two centuries and remains ingrained in the US Navy today.*

*Today, the Naval Heritage Society is on a mission to build a full-scale, fully functional replica of this incredible ship. The completed vessel will serve as home of a revolutionary series of teamwork and leadership programs based on naval discipline and tradition.*

There have been eight ships named *Hornet* in the US Navy, including two [World war II aircraft carriers, one of which is now a museum ship in Alemeda, CA.](http://www.uss-hornet.org/)
