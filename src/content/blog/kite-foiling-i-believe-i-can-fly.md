Here is a good video to start the week. Kite foiling is an amazing new niche in the world of sailing.  To be fair, kite boarders have sticking foils on the the bottom of their boards for years. Now, however, it looks like the sport is really taking off, so to speak. The first [Kite Foil Gold Cup](http://www.kitefoilgoldcup.com/) is now ongoing in La Ventana, Mexico and will be moving on to Switzerland, Austria and France during the year.

(By the way — the still below, which features a woman in a bikini, oddly enough, never appears in the video itself.  Still worth watching, despite the false advertising.)
