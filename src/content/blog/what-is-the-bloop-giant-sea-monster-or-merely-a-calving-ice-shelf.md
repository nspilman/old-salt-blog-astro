![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/monster.jpg)In 2009, [we posted about the “bloop.”](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/09/the-bloop-and-the-sea-serpent/)   What is the “bloop,” you well may ask?  The “[bloop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloop)” was an mysterious [ultra-low frequency underwater sound](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/sounds/bloop.html) detected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) several times during the summer of 1997.

NOAA was using an acoustic hydrophone array in the Pacific ocean originally developed by the US Navy to track Russian submarines.  The ”bloop” was heard on multiple sensors over a range greater than 5,000 km.  The sound appeared to be somewhere around 50° S 100° W (in the Pacific of the southwest coat of South American).  Scientists agreed that the bloop matches the audio profile of a living animal, but no known animal could have produced the sound.  Also given the range across which the sound was heard, any animal that created such a sound would have to be significantly larger than a blue whale, the largest creature ever know to have lived on the planet.  Was the bloop caused by a giant sea monster?

A more recent theory is somewhat more prosaic.  NOAA now thinks that the “bloop” may have been the massive calving of an ice shelf.  The video explains.
