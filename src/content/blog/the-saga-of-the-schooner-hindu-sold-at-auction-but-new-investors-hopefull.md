![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/hindu.jpg)For years the schooner *[Hindu](http://www.theschoonerhindu.com/)* has been a favorite in Provincetown, MA.  The classic schooner is credited in helping to establish the summer whale watching trade in the port.   Sadly, after several years of battles between her investors over the ownership and operation of the schooner, she was sold at auction yesterday for $500 to the only bidder, Fairwinds Credit Union of Orlando, Fla., to whom the previous owners of the schooner owe $336,000.  An unnamed group of investors in talks with the credit union to buy the Hindu and return it to New England.    According to [Schoonerman](http://www.schoonerman.com/sailing_ships_h.htm), “*Hindu* was designed by William Hand and built in 1925 by Hodgkin Bros., Boothbay, Maine.”   Thanks to Tom Russell of the [Traditional Sail Professionals Linked-In Group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=2041742) for the heads-up about the auction.
