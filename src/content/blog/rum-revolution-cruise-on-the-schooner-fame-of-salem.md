Schooner Fame

Some traditions should be honored.  I would certainly include rum drinking in that list. Tomorrow the [Schooner *Fame*](http://www.schoonerfame.com/main.html)  of Salem, Massachusetts is hosting a [Rum and Revolution Cruise](http://www.zerve.com/schoonerfame/rum), departing from Pickering Wharf Marina, in Salem at 4:00 PM.  After all, “*rum and sailors have always gotten along like wind and water!”*   The 1.75 hour long cruise features sailing on a traditional gaff-rigged wooden schooner, seeing lighthouses, forts, and beautiful waterfront homes, and the opportunity to purchase revolutionary beverages based on rum and wine.   Revolutionary beverages will be available for $5 to those of age.   The *Fame* of Salem, a replica of the privateer from the War of 1812.
