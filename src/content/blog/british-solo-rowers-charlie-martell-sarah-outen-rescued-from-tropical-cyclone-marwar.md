[](http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/tropical-cyclone-mawar-forces/66279)[Tropical cyclone Marwar](http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/tropical-cyclone-mawar-forces/66279) ended attempts by two solo British rowers to row across the Pacific this week.  [Sarah Outen,](http://www.sarahouten.com/) 27, was attempting to traverse the globe using only human power, by either rowing, kayaking or cycling.   She began her attempt from London in April of 2011.  Her quest ended on Thursday, roughly 575 miles off Japan, when tropical Cyclone Marwar capsized her seven-metre (23ft) boat *Gulliver*.  The boat was damaged in the capsize and was taking on water.  The car carrier *[Texas Highway](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?mmsi=432440000)* was the first to reach the stricken boat and stood by until the Japanese Coast Guard arrived.

[Charlie Martell,](http://www.pacific2012.com/) 41, a Royal Engineer Commando, was attempting to row from Choshi, Japan, to San Francisco, California, when his boat was also caught in tropical cyclone Marwar.  In 50 foot waves, his boat, *Blossum*, was rolled several times, damaging a bulkhead.  Martell was picked up by the bulk carrier *[MV Last Tycoon.](http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=1479356)*  
  
At peak intensity, Marwar had wind gusts over 130 mph. Fortunately, the storm was weakening as it passed near Outen and Martell to the northeast of Japan.  Both rowers issued distress calls on Thursday which were picked up by Falmouth Coast Coastguard and passed on to the coast guard in Japan.

Sarah Outen has earned three Three Guinness World Records and was the first woman and youngest person to row solo across the Indian Ocean.

Lieutenant Martell, who is mine clearing expert,  has previously rowed successfully across the Atlantic Ocean, a feat which earned two Guinness World Records.
