![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/11/johnbrownliberty2.jpg)As we have [previously posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/11/update-liberty-ship-ss-john-w-brown-still-looking-for-a-new-berth/), the restored Liberty ship, [*John W. Brown*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_John_W._Brown), was at risk of becoming homeless when its five-year agreement for berthing at Rukert Terminals’ Pier C in Canton, Maryland expired last September. Now, if all goes well, the historic ship may find a new home at the site of the [Bethlehem Fairfield Shipyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem_Fairfield_Shipyard) in Baltimore, where she was built in 1942.

In a [press release](https://www.ssjohnwbrown.org/new-page-2) from earlier in the week:

*[Project Liberty Ship Inc.](https://www.ssjohnwbrown.org/), owner and operator of the World War II museum ship SS JOHN W. BROWN, and [Maritime Applied Physics Corp. (MAPC)](http://www.mapcorp.com/) today announced an $18 million plan to revitalize a portion of the former Bethlehem Steel Fairfield Shipyard and provide a home base for the ship’s education and cruise activities as well as support for MAPC’s growing shipbuilding and maritime technology operations.*

*The proposal would utilize federal and state funding, augmented by corporate and individual donations, to rebuild a fitting-out pier at the former yard in South Baltimore. The pier would be owned and administered by a non-profit entity.*

That is the plan, at least. As Michael Barnes of Project Liberty Ship Inc., the all-volunteer group that owns and operates the *John W. Brown,* told the [Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bs-fe-john-w-brown-ship-20191230-pycdmnqfandd3g7fabs75jgyme-story.html)*,* no funding is yet in place to support the project. The group hopes that federal and state grants will cover some 60% to 70% of the cost, with the rest coming from corporate and private donations.

Barnes estimated the cost of the project at $10 million to $11 million for installation of a floating pier, which would have to be augmented to be strong enough to hold the *John W. Brown*, or $18 million to replace the structure with a “heavy-duty commercial pier” that could accommodate both the Brown and MAPC’s operations.

The [proposal is still at the conceptual design stage](https://chesapeakebaymagazine.com/baltimore-liberty-ship-to-find-home-at-former-beth-steel-shipyard/). Once a final design is chosen, permitting, demolition and construction must take place. The permitting process involves the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, the Maryland Port Administration, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Maryland Historical Trust, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Coast Guard, and others, but Barnes is optimistic that things will go smoothly because the project calls for replacing an existing pier, and because no dredging is required.

With an estimated completion goal of about two years, Project Liberty Ship is still working on a solution for interim docking.

*John W. Brown* is one of two remaining operational World War II Liberty Ships out of 2,710 built in an emergency shipbuilding program to carry troops and cargo. More than 350 were mass-produced at the Bethlehem-Fairfield shipyard.
