![ohprendering](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ohprendering.jpg)I recently booked a berth on the [SSV *Oliver Hazard Perry*](http://www.ohpri.org/)  on a passage next September from Newport to Bermuda under the command of Captain Richard Bailey.  I find it hard to believe that it was so long ago, but nevertheless, 17 years ago, I sailed aboard the replica frigate [*HMS Rose*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Surprise_\(replica_ship\)) from New York York to Bermuda with a group of Patrick O’Brian aficionados. Captain Richard Bailey was in command and he and his capable crew did a fine job managing the enthusiastic, but often clueless volunteers with skill and grace. (Who would have thought that herding cats would be a skill required of professional mariners.).  I am very much looking forward to the upcoming voyage.

In January, [w](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/01/ssv-oliver-hazard-perry-to-set-sail-in-2014-adventure-at-sea-berths-available/)[e posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/01/ssv-oliver-hazard-perry-to-set-sail-in-2014-adventure-at-sea-berths-available/) about the upcoming [Youth Adventure Summer Camp](http://www.ohpri.org/youth-summer-camp) on board the sail training vessel [Oliver Hazard Perry](http://www.ohpri.org/) for students between students between the ages of 13 -18 this August.  [Click here to learn more.](http://www.ohpri.org/teen-summer-camp)
