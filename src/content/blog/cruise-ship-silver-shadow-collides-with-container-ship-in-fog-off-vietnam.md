The luxury cruise ship *[Silver Shadow](http://www.silversea.com/ships/silver-shadow/)*  may have lived up to its name on Friday morning when it collided with a container ship in Ha Long Bay, Vietnam.  There were no reported injuries on the cruise ship, though passengers reported being knocked off their feet. The *Silver Shadow’*s bow damaged the bridge of the Vietnamese container ship.   *Silver Shadow* is owned and operated by [Silverseas Cruises](http://www.silversea.com/).

In 1956, the passenger ships, [*Andrea Doria* and the](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Andrea_Doria) *[Stockholm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Andrea_Doria)* collided in dense fog off Nantucket.  Both vessels were equipped with radar and radios.  The collision and subsequent sinking of the *Andrea Doria* is often referred to as a “radar assisted casualty.”   It appears that after fifty six years, nothing has necessarily changed. Fortunately, in the case of the *Silver Shadow* there were no reported injuries among the passengers. There is currently no information on possible injuries to the crew of the container ship.
