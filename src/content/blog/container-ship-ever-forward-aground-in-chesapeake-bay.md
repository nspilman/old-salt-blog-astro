![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/everforward.jpg)Almost one year ago, the container ship [*Ever Given* ran aground](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/03/suez-canal-still-blocked-by-ultra-large-container-ship-ever-given/), blocking the Suez Canal for six days. Now, another ship operated by the same shipping company, Evergreen Marine Corporation, has run hard aground. The [*Ever Forward*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:6378710/mmsi:477624800/imo:9850551/vessel:EVER_FORWARD), a 1,095-foot, 12,000 TEU, container ship, ran aground around 9PM on Sunday night after leaving Baltimore, a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard said.

The ship grounded outside the shipping channel off Gibson Island in the Chesapeake Bay. The ship, reported to have a draft of 42′ feet, ran aground in approximately 25′ feet of water while traveling at over 13 knots. The ship apparently failed to make a turn in the channel. It is unclear whether human error or a mechanical failure caused the casualty. The *Ever Forward* had a pilot aboard at the time of the grounding.

The Coast Guard said the cargo ship is outside the main shipping channel and is not a hazard to navigation. Ships in the area have been instructed to slow down and use a one-way traffic pattern. There are no reports of damage, injuries, or pollution as a result of the incident.
