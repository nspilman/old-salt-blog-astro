At least [Sir Cloudesley Shovell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudesley_Shovell) had an excuse, not that he really needed one. He drowned with the other 1,400 sailors in the [Scilly naval disaster of 1707](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scilly_naval_disaster_of_1707).  The navigators on the four warships that hit the Scilly’s Western Rocks lacked the tools to accurately calculate longitude.  The disaster is credited with inspiring the Longitude Act in 1714, which established the Board of Longitude and offered a large money prize for anyone who could find a method of determining longitude accurately at sea.

Recently, the [Team Vestas Wind](http://www.teamvestaswind.vestas.com/) racing in the Volvo Ocean Race ran aground on the Cargados Carajos Shoals in the Indian Ocean.  In a recent blog post, Elaine Bunting in [Yachting World asks the obvious question](http://www.yachtingworld.com/blogs/elaine-bunting/volvo-ocean-race-yacht-bristling-technology-hit-well-known-reef/): *How is it possible for a yacht bristling with the latest technology to hit a well-known reef, as Volvo Ocean Race crew Team Vestas Wind did, with catastrophic consequences? How can it happen to one of the world’s top navigators?* 

Obviously, someone made a mistake.  To err is human and all that.  Fortunately, in this case, no one died. All that the mistake cost was the sponsor’s money. The crew has now been safely repatriated to Mauritius.

There is a larger question here. Do our wonderful high tech electronics systems lull us into complacency? A sextant at seas is usually accurate to within a couple of miles. GPS can be accurate to within 15 meters.  Where once a navigator would allow several miles of “sea room” off a dangerous shoal, perhaps the perception of accuracy tempts navigators to be less cautious.

***Radar Assisted Collision***

It is not just GPS. The collision in fog between the passenger ships [Andrea Doria and the Stockholm](http://www.titanicology.com/AndreaDoria/Stockholm-Andrea_Doria_Collision_Analysis.pdf) in 1956 is often described as the first “radar assisted collision.”  Both ships had and used the most modern radars available. Because of the technology, officers on both ships knew the location of the other ship, yet using their electronics, both ships steered into each other, killing 51 passengers and crew. Would the ships have collided without radar? Quite possibly. Ships have been colliding in fog for all of time. On the other hand, the over confidence resulting from being able plot the other other ship on radar, led to very bad decision making, with tragic consequences.

***GPS Assisted Collision***

One of the more famous “GPS assisted groundings” occurred when the cruise ship [*Royal Majesty*](http://www.cruise-ships.com/majesty-cruise-line/transferred/royal-majesty/) hit the [Rose and Crown Shoal](https://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/1997/nantucket_ma/index.html) about 10 miles east of Nantucket Island in 1995. No lives were lost and the damage to the ship was relatively minor.  The question raised at time was “how could a ship equipped with GPS, Loran C, and radar run aground on a well charted shoal in a heavily trafficked seaway?”

The answer was that the GPS antenna on the *Royal Majesty* failed, yet the officers navigating the ship continued to rely of GPS. The GPS had shifted to a “dead reckoning” mode, which did not account for wind or current. They could have caught the error if they had consulted either their radar, Loran C, or used visual bearings.  When they ran aground, they were 17 miles off the track predicted by the faulty GPS.

***Innaccurate Charts***

Even if all electronics are working, there is no guarantee that the islands and shoals are where they are indicated on the charts. In the 2101 Clipper Round the World Race the yacht *Cork* was wrecked on the Gosong Mampango reef in the Java Sea. (Yes, the only yacht to sink on any of the Clipper Races was named “Cork.”) The reef is roughly a half mile off where it is shown on the chart.  Whether a half mile is sufficient sea room to put between a boat and a dangerous reef is a separate question.

On the night of January 17, 2013, the Navy mine countermeasures ship [USS *Guardian*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Guardian_\(MCM-5\)) ran hard aground on [Tubbataha Reef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubbataha_Reef) in the Sulu Sea.  The ship was a total loss and was later broken up on-site and hauled away.  Fortunately, no one was injured but the ship did considerable damage to the reef.  The reef is part of the Philippines’ [Tubbataha Reefs National Park](http://www.tubbatahareef.org/home).  In 1993, the [UNESCO declared the Tubbataha Reefs National Park](http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1058/) as a World Heritage Site as a unique example of an atoll reef with a very high density of marine species.

Although there were accurate charts aboard the ship, the electronic chart being used at the time of the grounding had an eight mile error in the position of the reef.  Even with this error it is still unclear why the *Guardian*  was anywhere near the reef.  The waters around the reef are a restricted zone which is off-limits to ships without prior approval. Nevertheless, the [Navy investigation](http://www.cpf.navy.mil/foia/reading-room/2013/06/uss-guardian-grounding.pdf) found that the voyage plan, referred to as the “*Plan of Intended Movement (PIM) \[passed\] over the northwest corner of the South Islet of Tubbataha Reefs, nearly the exact location where USS GUARDIAN ran aground. The PIM also passed through the middle of a clearly depicted Restricted Area encompassing the Tubbataha Reefs.*”

Why the ship intentionally steamed through the restricted area so close to the reefs is unclear. The commanding officer of ex-*Guardian*, the executive officer/navigator, the assistant navigator, and the officer of the deck at the time of the grounding were all relieved of their duties.  The statement by the Navy says, in part, “*USS Guardian leadership and watch teams failed to adhere to prudent, safe, and sound navigation principles which would have alerted them to approaching dangers with sufficient time to take mitigating action.*”  No other insight is provided into why the questionable navigational choices were made.

***Trust & GPS***

The underlying problem is that we all seem to place more faith than we should in the magic of GPS.  GPS provides the illusion of precision, which makes the independent confirmation of one’s position seem superfluous.  Old concepts like maintaining adequate sea-room seem antiquated and unnecessary.

Dr. Chris. W. Johnson of University of Glasgow; Dr. Christine Shea of ESR Technology Ltd, Cheshire, UK; and Dr. C. Michael Holloway, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, wrote a fascinating paper titled, [The Role of Trust and Interaction in GPS Related Accidents:](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~johnson/papers/GPS/Johnson_Shea_Holloway_GPS.pdf) [A Human Factors Safety Assessment of the Global Positioning System](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~johnson/papers/GPS/Johnson_Shea_Holloway_GPS.pdf).  In their conclusions they note:

“*The availability of accurate real-time navigation systems is no longer viewed as an additional enhancement to existing operational practices. Instead, these applications can be seen as capacity enablers. Users will erode safety margins providing that they can call upon the information provided by GPS technology. They will travel faster at closer distances from known hazards. This exposes operators and members of the public to even greater hazards when problems do occur with positioning systems….*

*It seems clear that trust in the services provided by navigational systems contributes to a form of over-confidence. Many accident reports describe the sense of surprise that operators express when they realise that there may have been a problem with navigation systems…*”

Elaine Bunting, writing about the [Vestas Wind grounding for Yachting World](http://www.yachtingworld.com/blogs/elaine-bunting/volvo-ocean-race-yacht-bristling-technology-hit-well-known-reef/), echoes these conclusions. She ends her comments succinctly: “*The biggest danger is certainty.”*
