![square1resized](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/square1resized.jpg)I am never sure what to make of the yearly “[World Oceans Day](http://www.worldoceansday.org/).” On a world where 71% of the globe is covered by oceans and where oceans contain 99 percent of the living space on the planet, shouldn’t every day be “World Ocean’s Day”?

Also, should this be a day for celebrating or mourning? Around the world coral reefs are dying. A recent scientific survey found that [93% of the Great Barrier Reef is now bleaching](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/the_democratic_nomination_process_is_fine.html) and in risk of being destroyed. Likewise, a report from the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that [the oceans will contain more plastic than fish by 2050](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oceans-plastic-fish-2050_us_569e9963e4b00f3e986327a0).  [Ocean acidification](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/What+is+Ocean+Acidification%3F) and [rising water temperatures threaten mass extinctions](http://www.livescience.com/6788-oceans-peril-primed-mass-extinction.html). [Rising sea levels](https://weather.com/science/environment/news/rising-sea-levels-threaten-millions-us-coastal-cities-climate-central) due to melting ice caps threaten major cities and coastal regions around the world. Climate change is even shifting the location of the [North Magnetic Pole](http://www.iflscience.com/environment/climate-change-causing-north-pole-move-towards-europe/).

It is clearly time to take the damage that we are doing to our oceans seriously. That doesn’t mean however that we should not also be celebrating the wonder and the glory of the seas and oceans that give us all life.  Part of the celebration, however, must be a commitment to act, to change, to save ourselves and this watery planet of ours.  The situation if dire, but it is still not too late.
