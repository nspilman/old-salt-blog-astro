![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/horatio_nelson.jpg)On April 2, 1801 at a key moment at the [Battle of Copenhagen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Copenhagen), Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, in overall command of the British forces, sent a signal to Vice-Admiral [Horatio Nelson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Nelson,_1st_Viscount_Nelson) to withdraw.  Nelson is said to have lifted his telescope to his blind eye and to have remarked, “I really do not see the signal.”  He carried on and won a great victory.   The phrase to [“turn a blind eye”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_a_blind_eye) is attributed to this moment in what was Nelsen’s most hard fought victory, two hundred and ten years ago today.
