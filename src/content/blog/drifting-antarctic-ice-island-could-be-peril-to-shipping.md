Most of the media is referring to the massive slab of ice that has broken off the Western Antarctic Pine Island glacier as an “iceberg.”  At 277 square miles of solid ice, I think an ice island is a more accurate designation.  [British scientists from Sheffield and Southampton universities](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24912233) have been awarded a £50,000 grant for a six-month study to track the iceberg as it drifts northward. They will track it and try to predict its path using satellite data. There is real concern that the the ice island could be hazardous to shipping in the Southern Ocean.
