![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Peking_ship_combined.jpg)[German media is reporting](http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/hamburg/Peking-kommt-erst-im-Fruehjahr-nach-Hamburg,peking1200.html) that sometime next spring, the historic Laeisz [Flying P-Liner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner) [*Peking*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_\(ship\)) is expected to leave New York harbor, where she has been a museum ship at the [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/) for over 40 years. She will be returning to her home port of Hamburg, where she was built, 105 years ago. In no condition to travel on her own bottom, [the grand old windjammer will be carried across the Atlantic](http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/hamburg/Peking-kommt-erst-im-Fruehjahr-nach-Hamburg,peking1200.html) on the deck of a heavy lift ship. Prior to her trans-Atlantic passage, she will move from the South Street Seaport to a local shipyard to be made ready for the voyage.

The *Peking*‘s new owner is the [Hamburg Maritime Foundation](http://www.stiftung-hamburg-maritim.de/). The ship will be part of the a new Hamburg maritime museum, which is under construction.

On August 26th, as part of their “[Free Fridays](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/free-fridays/)” program, the [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/) will be honoring the *Peking* with participatory sail-raising aboard the barque, printing demonstrations at Bowne Printers with *Peking* themed take-aways, and a special screening of [*Around Cape Horn*](http://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/event?oeidk=a07ed3q3g4mc96214b0&llr=4pcqx8iab).

The four-masted steel-hulled barque *Peking* was built in 1911 at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg for the German ship owner, F. Laeisz.  Laeisz operated a series of sailing ships whose name began with the letter P, which were know as the [Flying P Liners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner).  They were among the last generation of windjammers used in the nitrate trade and wheat trade around the often treacherous Cape Horn.

*Peking* made voyages from Europe to the west coast of South America with general cargo and returned filled with nitrates for use in the making of fertilizer and explosives. The windjammer was made famous by the Irving Johnson film *Around Cape Horn* which documented her 1929 passage around the southern tip of South America in hurricane conditions.

After 1933, the *Peking* served as the school ship, *Arethusa II*, mooring on the River Medway in Great Britain.  She was purchased as museum ship by the South Street Seaport Museum in 1975.

Remarkably, including *Peking*, four of the original Flying-P Liners survive today. The [*Pommern*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommern_\(ship\)) is a museum ship in Mariehamn, Finland. The [*Passat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passat_\(ship\)) is a museum ship in Lübeck’s sea resort Travemünde, Germany and the *Padua*, renamed [*Kruzenshtern*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruzenshtern_\(ship\)), is still sailing as a school ship under the Russian flag.
