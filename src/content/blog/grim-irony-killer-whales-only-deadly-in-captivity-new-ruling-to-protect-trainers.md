![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/orca.jpg)A recent ruling by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, determined that orca trainers must either remain at a greater distance from the orcas, stand behind a physical barrier or use other devices to keep them safer during performances. This ruling comes two years after the [death of Dawn Brancheau](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/02/24/orca-tilikum-kills-trainer-at-sea-world/), a trainer who was dragged underwater and killed by an orca at the SeaWorld park in Orlando.

Ironically, the whales that are called “killer” are not dangerous to humans in the wild.  Only once they are split from their family groups and held in small tanks to entertain ticket buyers, do they live up to the name.  There are no documented cases of a wild orca killing a human.  There is only one documented case of a wild orca ever actually biting a human.  By contrast, there have been at least two dozen cases of orcas attacking humans since the 1970s, exclusively perpetrated by captive animals. Four of these attacks have resulted in deaths.

[Killer whale attacks on humans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale_attacks_on_humans)  
  
[One site](http://www.orcahome.de/incidents.htm) lists 104 cases where captive orcas have acted aggressively toward their trainers. These range from bumping by the orca to attacks which resulted in the death of the trainers. Tillikum, the orca involved in Dawn Brancheau’s death was also involved in two other previous deaths.

Many blame the aggressive behavior of captive orcas in captivity due to stress.  Even the largest aquarium tanks are very small to an animal that can grow to over 20 feet long and can, in the wild, swim up to a hundred miles a day. Orcas also live in close family units in nature.  Captive orcas have been separated from their families usually at an early age.  In their own pods, wild female orcas typically live into their 50s or beyond and the males at least into their 30s. In captivity, most orcas do not live past twenty years, though there are exceptions.

This is not the case with all marine mammals. Bottlenose dolphins often live longer in captivity than in the wild.

While we think that it is worthwhile that trainers are receiving additional protection from captive orcas, it should also raise the question – who will protect the orcas from their captors?  Should these magnificent animals be kept in captivity at all?
