[Dog skeleton from Mary Rose displayed in Portsmouth](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/hampshire/8564209.stm)

*A dog which sailed aboard the Mary Rose ship 465 years ago is to take up residence in the Mary Rose Museum at the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.*  
  
*The animal’s skeleton, which has been reconstructed by staff at the Mary Rose Trust, will go on display from Friday 26 March.*

*The dog was discovered trapped in the sliding door of the carpenter’s cabin of the Mary Rose, which sank in 1545.*

*The dog, named Hatch by museum staff, was probably used as a ratter.*
