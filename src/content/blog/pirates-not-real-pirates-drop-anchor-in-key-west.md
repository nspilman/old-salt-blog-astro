![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/11/piratesinparadise.jpg)In my grumpier moments, I object to celebrating Disneyfied pirates, especially given that piracy is, after all, still a serious problem and not merely a quaint relic of the 16th and 17th centuries.  Then again, I can’t be grumpy all the time.   [“Pirates in Paradise”](http://www.piratesinparadise.com/), the ten days of “pure piratical escapades celebrating Key West’s rich & colorful maritime heritage” sounds like lots of fun, particularly if enough rum is involved.

*Celebrating the city’s rich and colorful maritime history and heritage, you can learn more about the ghosts that once walked these streets with Pirate Tours of Key West’s salty Pirate Walking Tours or Pub Strolls.*

*Learn WWII history by touring the historic submarine hunter — the USS MOHAWK CGC which signaled the start of the D-Day Invasion and the USCGC INGHAM, the country’s most decorated war ship.*

*These maritime museum ships are docked at Truman Watefront and wil also serve as the backdrop for the Festival’s annual Official End of America’s Hurricane Season Celebration which includes the Ceremonial Burning of the Hurricane Flags, live entertainment with Rich In Spirit and Mary Spear and Pyrates of the Coast; and a Sneak Preview of the Village Thieves Market, Pirate Pub & Holiday Bazaar that will open Friday, December 3.*

*The Key West Maritime Historical Society invites one and all to join them for author & historian Robert N. Macomber’s Key West Reader Rendezvous (November 29-December 3) which is part of the Festival’s annual Literature & the Sea Retreat. The public is invited to join Macomber for cocktails and a spectacular view of Key West’s fabulous sunset at the top of the Crown Plaza La Concha on Monday, November 29 and stay on for his Historic Glimpses presentation – GROG…A Drinking Story! On Tuesday, November 30, Bob will lead a Walking Tour of Historic Old Town Key West (departs from Ambrosia Key West’s Historic Pink House) and highlights those locations visited by Honor Series hero, Peter Wake. The tour concludes with a Book Signing at Voltaire Books.   Other Literature & the Sea events include Literature & the Sea Author’s Luncheon at Kelly’s Caribbean Bar, Grill & Brewery o(12/1); and the WOLF’s Authors & Historians Sail and El Meson de Pepe’s Caribbean Pirates Buffet (both 12/2.) Throughout the week you can also mingle with other well known artists, writers and entertainers who have helped create and keep alive the pirate lore of days gone by and the mystique of Key West, including John Viele, Christine Lampe, Don Maitz, Janny Wurts and the ‘Queen of Swing’ Norma Miller.*
