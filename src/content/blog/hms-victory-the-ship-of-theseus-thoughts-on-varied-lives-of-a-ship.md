![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/victory-stern3.jpg)We recently [posted about an announcement](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/01/on-100th-year-anniversary-of-drydocking-35m-committed-to-ongoing-restoration-of-hms-victory/) that an additional £35m is being committed for continued repairs to the [HMS *Victory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Victory), specifically to replace rotting planking and frames and to complete the rerigging of the ship. As it has been 256 years since the ship was launched and 244 years since the ship was commissioned, how much of the original ship remains after over two centuries of active service, repairs, and rebuilding? Depending on which source one uses, estimates range from 17% to 20%. The new funds for restoring the ship will no doubt reduce the percentage.

Is there a point at which HMS *Victory* is no longer the same ship whose decks were trod by Nelson at [Trafalgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar)? Or will HMS *Victory* always be the same historic ship no matter how often she is restored and repaired?

These are not new questions. They were discussed by the Greek philosophers Heraclitus and Plato by c. 500–400 BC in a thought experiment called the [Ship of Theseus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)

As later articulated by the historian Plutarch, a famous ship sailed by the hero Theseus, on his return from Crete, was kept in a harbor as a museum piece, and as the years went by, some of the wooden parts began to rot and were replaced by new ones; then, after a century or so, every part had been replaced. The question became whether the “restored” ship is still the same object as the original.

So, is HMS *Victory* an example of an almost Ship of Theseus, having been more than 80% reconstructed from the original ship? In *Victory*‘s case, it is not a straightforward question as after two centuries it is hard to determine what is original to the ship and whether “original” is a meaningful term.

The *Victory* was commissioned in 1785 and saw service in four significant battles. By 1797, she  was declared unfit for active service and left anchored off Chatham Dockyard. In December 1798 she was ordered to be converted to a hospital ship to hold wounded French and Spanish prisoners of war. With the loss of the 98 gun *Impregnable* in 1799, it was decided instead to keep her sailing and she was sent for a major rebuild at Chatham.

Between 1800 & 1803 *Victory* underwent a large repair at Chatham. At the same time, she was updated according to the latest instructions from the Navy Board. Her external appearance changed dramatically.

In the Battle of Trafalgar, *Victory* was seriously damaged and would require significant repairs over several decades. In 1831 the Admiralty issued orders for *Victory* to be broken up and her timbers reused in other vessels. A public outcry against the destruction of so famous a ship led to the order being held in abeyance and *Victory* was left, largely forgotten, at a Portsmouth mooring.

By 1922 the ship’s condition was so poor that she would no longer stay afloat and had to be moved into No. 2 dock at Portsmouth, the oldest dry dock in the world still in use, to avoid sinking. And in No. 2 dock she remains today, still under repair and restoration.

Does the long and varied history of HMS *Victory* answer the questions raised by the ancient Ship of Theseus thought experiment? I think it does. A ship, whether *Victory* or the Ship of Theseus, is more than a finite assemblage of its parts. Ships are complex machines that often can be made to evolve to fit the needs of their service. Perhaps, rather than being the sum total of its pieces, the venerable *Victory* is a synthesis of its varied lives and the sum total of its history.
