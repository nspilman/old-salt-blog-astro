Nevertheless there are moments when the idea of chucking it all and making a living on a sailboat or saling ship does have a certain appeal.

The two boats for sale are the [Rachel B. Jackson](http://www.boats.com/listing/boat_details.jsp?entityid=15656561&srh_prev=&srh_next=No%3d1%26rt%3dboat%26ro%3d1%26r%3d1959037%26entityid%3d19590371%26rs%3dyachtworld.com&rev_srh=bdi%3dtrue%26uom%3d126%26bcint%3d4%26sm%3d3%26duom%3d126%26wuom%3d126%26luom%3d126%26currencyid%3d100%26sfm%3dfalse%26Ntt%3dschooner%26slim%3dquick%26psdistance%3d1%26pszipcode%3dZipCode%26bn%3dhomepage%26zip%3dZipCode%26is%3dfalse%26Ntk%3dboatsEN%26Ntt%3dschooner) and the venerable [Victory Chimes](http://www.boats.com/listing/boat_details.jsp?entityid=19590371&srh_prev=No%3d0%26rt%3dboat%26ro%3d1%26r%3d1565656%26entityid%3d15656561%26rs%3dyachtworld.com&srh_next=No%3d2%26rt%3dboat%26ro%3d1%26r%3d1576406%26entityid%3d15764061%26rs%3dyachtworld.com&rev_srh=bdi%3dtrue%26uom%3d126%26bcint%3d4%26sm%3d3%26duom%3d126%26wuom%3d126%26luom%3d126%26currencyid%3d100%26sfm%3dfalse%26Ntt%3dschooner%26slim%3dquick%26psdistance%3d1%26pszipcode%3dZipCode%26bn%3dhomepage%26zip%3dZipCode%26is%3dfalse%26Ntk%3dboatsEN%26Ntt%3dschooner). The Rachel B. Jackson is a 1982 built replica of an 1890s coastal schooner. She is a 67’LOA and 52’LOD gaff rigged topsail schooner, Coast Guard Inspected, and Certified to carry 30 passengers, presumably on daysails.  She is offered for sale for $350,000.00.

To say that she is an icon may be understating things. The Victory Chimes is listed as a Federal [National Historic Landmark](http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=130263&ResourceType=Structure) and shows up on the [Maine State Quarter](http://www.netstate.com/states/quarters/me_qtr.htm).   She is the only existing vessel that I am am aware of that is represented on US currency or coinage.

This musing about Maine Windjammers slightly less theoretical after reading a wonderful article in the Augsut 21, 2008 [Down East](http://www.downeast.com/) magazine  – [The Business of Raising Sails on a Maine Windjammer](http://www.downeast.com/Berth-of-Cool/August-2008/The-Business-of-Raising-Sails-on-a-Maine-Windjammer/) by Ben McCanna.  He describes a trip on the *Lewis R. French*  with Captain Garth and looks briefly into the economics of windjammer sailing.

 “As a schooner bum, Garth wasn’t making enough money to put a down payment on the boat; he’d have to borrow 100% of the selling price. The First National Bank of Damariscotta was quick to lend 75% of the money—after all, the *Lewis R. French* was essentially a turnkey business — and, luckily, Garth was able to borrow the rest from a few private investors (one of whom was a regular *Lewis R. French* passenger).

Garth won’t discuss what the selling price was, but the rumor is a windjammer will cost you somewhere between $400K and $800K depending on the number of guests she’ll carry.”

I am not sure about  the economics of the Victory Chimes but suddenly the Rachel B. Jackson looks remarkably reasonable.
