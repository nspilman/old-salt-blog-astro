Team Hallin Held the Record for One Day

On Monday, the six British rowers of [Team Hallin have set a new world record](http://explorersweb.com/oceans/news.php?id=19943) for rowing the Atlantic Ocean.  The five men and one woman landed in Barbados after completing the 3,000 mile course from Tenerife in 31days and 23hours and 31 minutes.   Then on Tuesday, the 2011 Ocean rowing boat [‘*Sara G*’ shaved 10 hours 36 minutes off the record](http://explorersweb.com/oceans/news.php?id=19946) set by Team Hallin the day before.  How long the new record will stand is unclear. A third rowing team on the [*Britannia III*](http://www.thisissouthdevon.co.uk/news/South-Devon-s-Atlantic-rowers-switch-start-Gran-Canaria/article-3103596-detail/article.html) left the Canary nine days ago intent on setting a new record of their own.
