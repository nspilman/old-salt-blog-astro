Here is a short video by the [Harbor School](https://www.newyorkharborschool.org/), a public high school located on Governors Island in New York harbor.  The school’s mission is to “*provide a college-preparatory education built upon New York City’s maritime experience that instills in students the ethics of environmental stewardship and the skills associated with careers on the water.*” In the video they are doing just that sailing on the [*Lettie G. Howard*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettie_G._Howard), a Fredonia schooner built in 1893 in Essex, Massachusetts.
