![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/07/columbiaisland.jpg)Looking for a private island getaway within a reasonable commuting distance of New York City? [Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Island_\(New_York\)) (ex-Little Pea) and [Pea Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pea_Island_\(New_Rochelle,_New_York\)) are for sale. The two islands are in the western end of Long Island Sound and 10-minutes by boat from New Rochelle, NY.  Pea Island is roughly 2 acres and is undeveloped while Columbia Island is around an acre with a landscaped house. Columbia’s land area varies with the tides.  

The current owner, [Dr. Albert Sutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Sutton), bought Columbia Island for one million dollars in 2007 and subsequently bought Pea Island, 400 yards away, for $450,000. Dr. Sutton spent an additional $8 million over more than a decade, building a 5,625 square foot, 4 bedroom, 2 bath off-the-grid residence on Columbia. As reported by the [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/nyregion/island-sale-nyc.html?searchResultPosition=1), Dr. Sutton spent only one night on the island. And now, he has put Columbia and Pea Island up for sale for $13 million. If you should have the cash burning a hole in your pocket, be aware that the property taxes on the island are also listed at $42,885/year.

Pea and Little Pea Islands were owned by the Iselin family, one of the more successful New York merchant families in the mid 19th century until the family sold the two undeveloped islands to the Huguenot Yacht Club in 1936. Four years later, the yacht club sold Little Pea Island to the Columbia Broadcasting Company, which renamed the island, Columbia, and installed a 50,000-watt transmitter powering a 410-foot broadcast tower.  They also built a  transmitter building with emergency housing for ten workers. The transmitter operated until 1963.

The island was then purchased by the show-business couple Peter Lind Hayes and Mary Healy, who broadcast a breakfast conversation show from their home there. They donated the property to the [College of New Rochelle in 1966.](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/01/13/79279070.pdf)
