![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/04/nanggala4022.jpg)The Indonesia Navy announced that it has located debris from the missing submarine [KRI *Nanggala 402*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRI_Nanggala_\(402\)), indicating that the submarine sank with the loss of 53 crew. 

[API](https://apnews.com/article/asia-pacific-indonesia-98b58437f6742d197d1eb593db954894) reports that military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said the presence of an oil slick, as well as the discovery of debris near the location of KRI *Nanggala* 402′s last dive on Wednesday off the island of Bali, were clear proof the vessel had sunk. Indonesia earlier considered the vessel to be only missing.

Navy Chief Yudo Margono told a press conference in Bali, “If it’s an explosion, it will be in pieces. The cracks happened gradually in some parts when it went down from 300 meters to 400 meters to 500 meters … If there was an explosion, it would be heard by the sonar.”

The navy previously said it believes the submarine sank to a depth of 600-700 meters (2,000-2,300 feet), much deeper than its collapse depth of 200 meters (655 feet), at which point water pressure would be greater than the hull could withstand.

Margono said that in the past two days, searchers found parts of a torpedo straightener, a grease bottle believed to be used to oil the periscope, debris from prayer rugs, and a broken piece from a coolant pipe that was refitted on the submarine in South Korea in 2012.
