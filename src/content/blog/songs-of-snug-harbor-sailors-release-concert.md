![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/snugsing1.jpg)If you are near New York harbor tomorrow and have the chance, head on over to the [The Noble Maritime Collection](http://www.noblemaritime.org/) at the [Snug Harbor Cultural Center](http://snug-harbor.org/) between 2 PM and 5 PM tomorrow, April 22, for a free concert celebrating the release of a new CD, “[Songs of the Snug Harbor Sailors](https://www.facebook.com/events/120472935162497/),” featuring Liverpool’s own Hughie Jones, with Bob Wright, Bob Conroy, Frank Woerner, Frank Hendricks, Houseboat Jimmie Visone, Chrissie Jones, and Jan Christensen. Copies of the CD, and others, will be available for sale. Unfortunately, I will be away, but it should be a great concert with wonderful performers. Don’t miss it if you have the chance.
