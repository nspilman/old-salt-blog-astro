![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/squid.jpg)A [colossal squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_squid) has been caught on camera for the first time in the deep sea by an international team of researchers steering a remotely operated submersible. Ironically, the first colossal squid caught on camera was anything but colossal.

Adult colossal squid have been estimated to have a maximum total length between 10 meters (33 ft) and 14 meters (46 ft).  The squid on video was not colossal, despite its species designation. It was a juvenile of only about 1 foot in length.

The young colossal squid in the video was swimming around 600 meters down, Dr. Kat Bolstad, a deep-sea cephalopod biologist, said, not in the deeper waters where adults likely dwell. Other deep-sea squids spend their early lives in shallower waters, she said. Having a transparent body may help the baby swim undetected by predators before it descends as an opaque, reddish adult to the darker ocean.

As noted by the [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2476783-first-ever-confirmed-image-of-a-colossal-squid-in-the-deep-ocean/), for decades, the Kraken-like colossal squid ([*Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni*](https://eol.org/pages/46475868)) was [more myth than reality](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2147242-five-mythical-animals-that-turned-out-to-be-real/): scientists had only a vague sense of its appearance from fragments of its remains found in the [stomachs of the whales that eat the molluscs](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11374-do-sperm-whales-dive-deep-for-sluggish-squid/). In fact, it was through those remains that the species was officially described by zoologists in 1925.

Finally, in 1981, fishers in Antarctica accidentally reeled up a live colossal squid in their fishing nets. Since then, the animals have sometimes been killed as fishing bycatch, or have washed ashore dead.

Last month, a vessel from the [Schmidt Ocean Institute](https://schmidtocean.org/),  a US-based non-profit organisation, was surveying the Southern Ocean near the South Sandwich Islands and live-streaming the footage from their remotely controlled deep-sea cameras, when an online viewer flagged that they might have just filmed a colossal squid.

Acting on the tip, the researchers sent the high-resolution footage to independent squid experts. The experts confirmed that the online viewer’s hunch was correct: the squid had distinctive hooks along the suckers on its eight arms, which are a hallmark of the colossal squid. It was roaming at 600 meters under the water’s surface.
