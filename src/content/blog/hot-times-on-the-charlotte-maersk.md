*A company spokesperson said, however, that they were not certain when the fire, now in its second day, would be put out entirely.*

*Maersk spokesman Michael Christian Storgaard said the ship’s crew and crews from nearby ships were working to cool containers surrounding the fire in order to prevent it from spreading*.
