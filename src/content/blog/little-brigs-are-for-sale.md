![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/littlebrig.jpg)Sad news from the [Little Brig Trust,](http://www.littlebrig.org/) which operates two very small tall-ships. The Gosport based charity has announced that after a review of operations, that it did not have the capacity to continue into 2019, and so are putting their two “little brigs” up for sale.

As [we posted in 2010](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/03/little-brig-%E2%80%93-the-smallest-tall-ship/), the two 9 meter brigs, the *Bob Allen* and the *Caroline Allen,* were designed to introduce sailors as young as ten to the fun and challenges of sailing a square-rigged “tall ship.”   The small tall-ships cost less to build, operate and crew than larger vessels. They are also incredibly cute.  The small tall-ships were designed by British naval architect Colin Mudie.  

The statement by the Trust went on to say: *We are placing the Little Brigs for sale as one lot and welcome offers based on the fact they have life-rafts, life-jackets and a multitude of other items (including two working engines) we have sent a minimum reserve.*

*If you would like to purchase please send a bid to [info@littlebrig.org](mailto:info@littlebrig.org) and we will contact you to discuss.*
