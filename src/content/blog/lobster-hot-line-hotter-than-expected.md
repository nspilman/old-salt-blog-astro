To provide information about a new Canadian lobster industry financial stimulus program,  Canada’s department of fisheries set up a “hot line” which proved somewhat hotter than expected.  Instead of hearing information on lobstering, callers were greeted with a woman’s voice saying,  “Hey there, hot stuff, I’ve been waiting for your call.  Are you ready for some tantalizing fun?”   The agency apparently got the number right but the area code wrong, so the calls were directed to an phone sex service.  Oops.
