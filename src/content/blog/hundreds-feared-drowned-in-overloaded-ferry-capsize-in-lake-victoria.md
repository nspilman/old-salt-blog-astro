![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/09/victoria-ferry.jpg)MV *Nyerere*, a ferry traveling from Bugolora to Ukara island in Lake Victoria, Tanzania [capsized](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/09/10/tanzania.death.toll/index.html) on Thursday. While the ferry had a rated capacity of 100 passengers, reports indicate that as many as 400 people may have been aboard when the ferry capsized. Only 80 passengers were rescued. At least 126 have been confirmed dead. Close to 200 may be missing.

Lake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa, which straddles the borders of Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya.

Tragically, Ferries in Tanzania are often overloaded. In 1996, up to 1,000 people drown when the Lake Victoria ferry MV *Bukoba* sank. MV *Bukoba* had a rated capacity of 430 passengers.
