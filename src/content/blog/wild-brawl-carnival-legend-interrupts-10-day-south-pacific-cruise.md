![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Carnival-Legend.jpg)Joseph Conrad once wrote about a conversation with an old sailor who had just signed off a ship. The sailor said something to the effect that “the ship was alright. The problem was the people on it.” The comment seems to apply to a recent 10-day South Pacific cruise on the [*Carnival Legend*](https://www.cruisecritic.com/reviews/review.cfm?ShipID=253).  

According to published accounts, there was a three-day running brawl on the cruise ship involving 23 members of an unruly family group, resulting in what some passengers are describing as a [“bloodbath” and “the cruise from hell.”](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/682620/cruise-ship-bloodbath-Carnival-Legend-cruise-ship-Australia-brawl-video-lasted-three-days)   Exactly how it started and what happened is unclear but cell phone video of the fights in various parts of the ship are disturbing. 

The [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5398975/Savage-Carnival-Legend-fight-started-thong.html) reports that the melee was triggered when someone stepped on a thong. “One of the passengers involved, named only as Zac, said the tension between his family and another group started over a thong being stepped on. ‘This is all over a thong – not a foot, a thong – being stepped on and being instantly apologized for. What happened there and then was apologized for,’ he told [3AW.](https://www.3aw.com.au/brawl-breaks-out-aboard-cruise-ship-to-south-pacific/)

Carnival Cruise Line downplayed the events saying that “staff had taken action against a small number of disruptive guests.”

Ultimately, the ship was diverted and the group, identified as the Barkho family, was sent ashore in [Eden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden,_New_South_Wales). Not the garden of Eden, but the port town in New South Wales, Australia. NSW Police said six men and three teenage boys were removed from the ship and that a further 14 passengers, including women and children, left voluntarily. No one has been charged following the incident. Reportedly, insults and lewd gestures were exchanged as the family left the ship.

[Carnival Cruise Line announced that passengers on the cruise](http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/bloodbath-as-violence-erupts-on-carnival-legend-cruise-ship-passengers-say/news-story/6447a7650227e67c79de3c7f7d5962f5) will be offered a 25 percent Future Cruise Credit as “a goodwill gesture”. They also promised, “a full investigation to ensure that a situation such as this never happens again”.

In Melbourne, [David Barkho, described as the family patriarch](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5402443/Family-removed-Carnival-Legend-cruise-deny-violence.html), who was not on the cruise, told the Daily Mail Australia, “It’s all lies. None of what is being said is true. It’s all in the hands of our legal team.”  He went on to say that several family members were in the hospital. 

The *Carnival Legend* is a Spirit Class cruise ship with a passenger capacity of 2,124 and a crew of 930. It operates in the respective Summer seasons in Alaska and in Australia. [Cruise Critic](https://www.cruisecritic.com/reviews/review.cfm?ShipID=253) gives the ship a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.
