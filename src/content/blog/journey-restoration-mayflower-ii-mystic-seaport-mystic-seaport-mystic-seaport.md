[![mayfloweriia](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mayfloweriia.jpg)Mystic Seaport](http://www.mysticseaport.org/)’s [Henry B. duPont Preservation Shipyard](http://www.mysticseaport.org/locations/shipyard/) is working in partnership with [Plimoth Plantation](http://www.plimoth.org/) to restore [*Mayflower II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower_II). *Mayflower II* will move back to its berth at the Plimouth Plantation for the summer and then return to Mystic for an extended restoration in the Fall lasting into 2019.  

*Mayflower II* is a replica of the 17th-century ship [*Mayflower*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower), which carried the Pilgrims to the New England in 1620. The replica was built in Devon, England and sailed to the United States in 1957 under the command of Alan Villiers. Also at Mystic Seaport is the full-rigged iron ship [*Joseph Conrad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad_\(ship\)) which [Villiers sailed around the world](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/12/alan-villiers-mayflower-ii-joseph-conrad-and-mystic-seaport/) in 1934-1936 with a crew of sail trainees.
