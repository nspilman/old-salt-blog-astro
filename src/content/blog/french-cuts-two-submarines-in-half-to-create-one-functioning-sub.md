![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/perle.jpg)In June 2020, an intense fire broke out in the bow of the French nuclear attack submarine [*Perle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_submarine_Perle_\(S606\)), while the ship was in drydock in Toulon in southern France. The submarine’s 48-megawatt  nuclear reactor that had been removed when it entered the drydock in January 2020, was unharmed. While the bow was seriously damaged in the blaze, the stern section of the submarine was relatively unscathed by the fire. Now, the French Navy is endeavoring to repair the submarine by cutting off *Perle*‘s damaged bow and welding on the bow section of a decommissioned sister submarine to the undamaged stern.  

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/europe/france-submarines-cut-in-half-intl-hnk-scli-ml/index.html) reports that one of *Perle*‘s sister boats, the *Saphir*, which was retired from service in 2019, was awaiting dismantling at a shipyard in the northwestern port of Cherbourg. The *Saphir*‘s front section was structurally sound, and French officials determined it could be mated with the rear of the *Perle* to make one serviceable attack submarine.

The damaged Perle was moved from Toulon to Cherbourg on a semi-submersibile ship in December.  Workers cut the Perle in half in February and did the same to the Saphir in March, according to a news release from French shipbuilder Naval Group.

The resulting submarine, which will still be called the *Perle*, will be about four-and-a-half feet (1.4 meters) longer than either of its predecessors to accommodate a “junction area” while the miles of cables and pipes that run through the sub will be spliced together, the release said.  
The junction area will also provide room for new living quarters, adding a bit of space for the crew of 70 submariners.

The *Perle*, commissioned in 1993, was the newest of what once were six [Rubis-class nuclear submarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubis-class_submarine) in the French fleet. The *Saphir*, the second boat in the class, was commissioned in 1984, serving 35 years before its decommissioning.
