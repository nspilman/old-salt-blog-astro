![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/penobscottmm.jpg)The [Penobscot Marine Museum](http://www.penobscotmarinemuseum.org/) is seeking submissions from artists in all visual media for a juried  art exhibit entitled “The Art of the Boat.”  The show will examine the artistic aspects of boat design and construction, and will run from May through October 2011.

From the Museum press release:

*“This exhibit will explore the boat as art and the boatbuilder as artist,” said the museum’s curator, Ben Fuller. “We will look for the artist’s interpretation of the boatbuilder’s art through studies of shape, form, structure and details.”*  
  
*Artists may submit up to four pieces for consideration in any visual medium, including painting, drawing, photography, sculpture and other three-dimensional media, and multimedia. Submissions should be sent as .jpeg (.jpg) files with a maximum size of 2 megabytes to [artoftheboat@pmm-maine.org](mailto:artoftheboat@pmm-maine.org) by March 15, 2011. This is also the address for questions.*

*Submitted works will be judged by a panel which may include art critics, art collectors, boat designers and boatbuilders. The panel will select approximately 40 pieces for display by April 15, 2011. The show will run from May 28 through October 23. More information is available at [www.PenobscotMarineMuseum.org](http://www.penobscotmarinemuseum.org/).*

*Penobscot Marine Museum, in Searsport, is Maine’s oldest maritime museum and home to the state’s largest display of historic boats and outstanding collections of marine art and artifacts, ship models and historic photography. Its exhibits are closed from November through late May, but activities and special presentations occur year-round.
