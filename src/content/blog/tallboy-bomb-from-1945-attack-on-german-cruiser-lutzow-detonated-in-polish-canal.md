![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/10/tallboy.jpg)The [biggest World War II bomb ever found in Poland](https://www.reuters.com/article/poland-bomb-tallboy/biggest-world-war-two-bomb-found-in-poland-explodes-while-being-defused-idINKBN26Y2IM) exploded underwater on Tuesday as navy divers tried to defuse it with a remote control device. No one was injured in the explosion.

During World War II, the British developed the [tallboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallboy_\(bomb\)), an “earthquake bomb,” designed to be used against large, heavily fortified structures. It also proved to be very effective against ships. The 12,000-pound bomb was packed with 5,200 pounds of high explosive and could only be carried in specially modified  [Avro Lancaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Lancaster "Avro Lancaster") heavy bombers. 

On April 16, 1945, RAF heavy bombers attacked the German heavy cruiser *[Lützow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_cruiser_Deutschland)* with tallboy bombs near Świnoujście, Poland. One of the bombs, which missed the cruiser, remained buried in the middle of the main shipping channel of the Piast Canal for 74 years. The bomb was discovered during the preparatory works for deepening the Świnoujście-Szczecin fairway in September 2019. The attempt to defuse the bomb resulted in the explosion.

The Piast Canal connects the Baltic Sea with the Oder River on Poland’s border with Germany.
