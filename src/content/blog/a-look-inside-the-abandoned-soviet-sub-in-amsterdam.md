![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/b80zulu.jpg)A group of “[urban explorers](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5864539/Urban-explorers-reveal-hidden-depths-abandoned-Soviet-submarine.html)” ventured out to climb aboard an abandoned Soviet submarine tied up in the Maritime Quarter, the former NDSM shipyard in Amsterdam North, in the Netherlands. The submarine was built in 1956 or 1957. It was designated 4711 B-80, and is variously described online as either a [Zulu](http://www.comtourist.com/history/b-80-submarine/) or a [Foxtrot Class](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:4711_Foxtrot_\(submarine,_1957\)) submarine. (The B-80 appears to be one of the last of the earlier [Zulu class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu-class_submarine).) 

The submarine was purchased from Russia in 1991 by Dutch submarine enthusiasts. It was then sold to an architect in Amsterstad in 2002 and has various owners since. At one point it was intended to be used as party space, which didn’t work out for many reasons. She appears now to owned by Turkish investors who have been directed to remove the ship, but apparently, have been delayed by ongoing disputes over towing charges. In the meantime, the sub sits abandoned, decorated with graffiti for all to see and for few to climb onboard.  

The video below is in Dutch but nicely captures visually what is left of the old submarine.
