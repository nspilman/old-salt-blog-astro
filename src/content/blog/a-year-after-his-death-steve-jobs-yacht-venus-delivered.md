More than six years ago, Steve Jobs commissioned a custom yacht from the Dutch shipbuilder Feadship.  Designed by French designer Philippe Starck, the 250-foot yacht, *Venus*, has been delivered, a year after Job’s death.  Jobs told biographer Walter Issacson, “I know that it’s possible that I will die and leave \[wife\] Laurene with a half-built boat. But I have to keep going on it. If I don’t it’s an admission that I’m about to die.”
