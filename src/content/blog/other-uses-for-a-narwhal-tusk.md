![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/narwhal.jpg)When a terrorist began attacking people with knives on London Bridge recently, a man, described in news reports as a Polish chef, at nearby Fishmongers’ Hall, where the incident began, [grabbed a narwhal tusk](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/30/narwhal-tusk-and-fire-extinguisher-used-to-tackle-london-bridge-attacker) that was displayed by the side of the hall’s doorway and, wielding it like a lance, deployed it against the assailant outside. It was one of the more unusual uses of a narwhal tusk in recent memory. 

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/11/30/narwhal-tusk-has-wondrous-mystical-history-new-chapter-was-added-london-bridge/) quotes British historian and journalist Guy Walters on the use of the tusk. “*There’s something very British about fighting a terrorist with something as surreal as a narwhal tusk,” he said. “We don’t carry weapons in this country. But we do have narwhal tusks around.”* 

“*The beauty of narwhals is that they were always these really mysterious creatures,*” he said. *“For centuries no one really knew what they were. When they found these tusks they assumed that they were unicorns. … They became these incredibly sought-after items.”*

Narwhal tusks, believed to be the horns of unicorns, have long been perceived to have magical and curative powers. [Waters pointed out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/guywalters/status/1200705088521682944) that Queen Elizabeth I was given a narwhal tusk and valued it highly.

*A narwhal tusk is not a cheap weapon. One sold in auction for £36,000 a few years ago. Elizabeth I so valued the one presented to her by privateer Martin Frobisher that she placed it in the Royal Wardrobe & Treasury. It was valued at £10,000 in 1598 — some £2 million today*.  

If humans have managed to find multiple uses for narwhal tusks, what do the narwhals use them for? First, what is the tusk itself? The narwhal’s tusk is actually an overgrown spiralized tooth that grows from the upper jaw through the top of the whale’s head. The tooth/tusk can grow to 9 feet long. It is a unique and amazingly sensitive tooth containing upwards of ten million nerve endings. All these nerve endings must be valuable for something, although scientists are not quite sure what.  

But what are the tusks used for? The tusks grow almost exclusively on male narwhal leading some scientists to suggest that the tusks might be useful for attracting a mate. Some have also suggested that the tusks might be useful in breaking through ice. 

More recently, drone video has shown narwhals using their tusks to catch food. Rather than spearing their prey with their tusks they slap the water to stun the fish and quickly gobble them up. Here is footage from documentary filmmaker Adam Ravetch of narwhals using their tusks to stun Arctic cod.
