Sport Sub submersible

[Slate.com](http://www.slate.com/id/2304746/) recently recently featured and article, [You-Boat, Can you buy your own submarine?](http://www.slate.com/id/2304746/).  They noted that drug smugglers had their own submarines to sneak cocaine and other drugs north. If they had subs why couldn’t we all own a personal submarine?  They then went onto say that, “*around $600,000 will get you an entry-level, winged submersible without a pressurized cabin. If you’re willing to spend $2 million, you can buy a two-person submersible with a see-through acrylic dome.*”  That seemed awfully expensive for a personal submarine. So we decided to do some shopping.  You an get started for a lot less than $600,000.  
  
The [SportSub submersibles](http://www.ivccorp.com/) built by International VentureCraft Corp. run between $30,000 to $70,000 depending on the model. They essentially allow scuba diving without wearing a mask or a regulator.  See the Youtube video after the jump.

They provide pricing on request, though an article from 2007 describing them as “[The world’s first affordable recreational submarine](http://www.gizmag.com/go/6916/)” and mentioned a starting price of around 65,000 British pounds for a single seat model. Prices have no doubt gone up since then.

Jumping to the other end of the spectrum where money is no object, the [Phoenix 1000](http://www.ussubmarines.com/submarines/phoenix_1000.php3) is 65 meters long and “ *is capable of making trans-Atlantic crossings at 16 knots yet can dive along the route and explore the continental margins of some of the most fascinating waters on earth.”*  It also costs around $80 million.  Here are the [tech specs](http://www.ussubmarines.com/submarines/phoenix_technical.php3) for anyone interested.
