The US Navy keeps trying to find new and different ways to blow things up.   [Last December it demonstrated an electromagnetic railgun](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/index.php?s=rail+gun) potentially capable of hitting a target 100 miles away.  Recently, it has used a a solid-state laser, aboard the USS *Paul Foster,* to set a small board on fire over a mile away while both vessels were under way.
