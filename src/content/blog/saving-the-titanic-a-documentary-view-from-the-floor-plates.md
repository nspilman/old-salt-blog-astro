As described on the PBS website:

*Saving the Titanic … tells the untold story of the self-sacrifice and bravery of the ship’s engineers, stokers and firemen in the face of impending death. Starring an ensemble cast featuring David Wilmot (The Guard, The Tudors and Intermission) and Ciaran McMenamin (Sinking of the Laconia, David Copperfield and Primeval), Saving the Titanic seeks to answer the question of what happened in the engine and boiler rooms after the ship’s fateful collision with a North Atlantic iceberg. Based on eyewitness accounts, this is the remarkable story of nine men from the engineering crew who fought courageously to hold back the power of the sea and keep the power systems running, even when they learned that all was lost. The engineering crew consisted of fireman and stokers, who shoveled coal into the ship’s 29 boilers that powered its two massive steam engines, and engineers who made sure the engines and other mechanical equipment functioned smoothly. A memorial to commemorate their bravery was erected in Liverpool, England and unveiled in 1916.*

Thanks to Brian Frizell and Phil Leon for pointing out the documentary.
