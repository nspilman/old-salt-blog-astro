![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/usstheodoreroosevelt.jpg)In late March, there were [reports of three cases of coronavirus](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/03/aircraft-carrier-uss-theodore-roosevelt-diverted-to-guam-due-to-virus-outbreak/) on the aircraft carrier USS *Theodore Roosevelt*.  The number quickly grew to dozens and the ship was diverted to Guam. Now, the testing of sailors aboard the Roosevelt is nearly completed. Of 4,865 of the crew who have now been tested, 416 tested positive, and 3,170 tested negative, while the results for another 1,164 are still pending. Of those testing positive, 229 — more than half — showed no symptoms of the disease. About 2,700 crew members have been taken off the ship and are lodged on the base and in hotels on the island. Those who have tested positive are being checked by medics twice a day.

One of the personnel who tested positive was the ship’s commander Captain Brett Crozier, who was fired for raising concerns about the spread of the virus among his crew. Captain Crozier is being treated. One member of the crew was hospitalized Thursday in intensive care on Guam. 

The military is beginning to acknowledge that the spread of the virus on Navy ships is likely to only grow worse.

[Gen. John Hyten, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told a Pentagon news conference](http://time.com/5818530/navy-ships-coronavirus/), “It’s not a good idea to think that the Teddy Roosevelt is a one-of-a-kind issue. … We have too many ships at sea. … To think that it will never happen again is not a good way to plan.”

The Navy’s top officer, meanwhile, said the biggest problem is the inability to test enough people quickly, including those aboard the USS *Nimitz*, the next U.S.-based aircraft carrier due to deploy out to sea.

Just as there has been inadequate testing available ashore, the Navy has not been able to test its crews for the virus quickly and efficiently. While social distancing is possible ashore, that is not the case in the crowding berthing deck on warships.
