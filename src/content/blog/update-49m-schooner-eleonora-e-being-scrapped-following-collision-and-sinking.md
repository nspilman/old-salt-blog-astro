![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ElonoraE.jpg)Sad news. The [*Eleonora E*](https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/the-superyacht-directory/eleonora-e--42501) is being scrapped.

Last June, we [posted that the classic 49m schooner](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/06/schooner-eleonora-e-sunk-by-out-of-control-offshore-supply-vessel/) was struck by a 60m long search and rescue vessel in Port Tárraco, Tarragona, Spain, and subsequently sank. The search and rescue vessel *Punta Mayor* was maneuvering in the harbor and became stuck in reverse. The vessel struck *Eleonora E* at midships on the starboard side, crushing the schooner against a seawall.

[Boat International](https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/sailing-yacht-eleonora-e-scrapped-in-spain) reports that the yacht was left submerged for several weeks following the strike by a search and rescue vessel in June 2022. A refloating operation took place over the course of three weeks in September, and she was relocated to PTW-Shipyard in Tarragona where it was hoped she could be salvaged.

The water-damaged hull has since been moved to a scrapping facility in Vinaròs and the remains of the yacht are expected to be scrapped in the coming weeks. 

Built in 2000, at the Van der Graaf shipyard in Holland, *Eleonora E* is a replica of the Herreshoff-designed *Westward*, one of the most famous racing schooners in the world which raced against yachts such as *Britannia* and *Lulworth* in the early 1900s.
