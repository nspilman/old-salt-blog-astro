![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/awhaleskimmer.jpg)After a second round of testing, the converted O/B/O skimmer *A Whale* has been judged a failure in skimming oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

*The massive “A Whale” oil skimmer has effectively been beached after it proved inefficient in sucking up oil from the Gulf of Mexico spill.*

*The oil is too dispersed to take advantage of the converted Taiwanese supertanker’s enormous capacity, said Bob Grantham, a spokesman for shipowner TMT.*

*He said BP’s use of chemical dispersants prevented A Whale, billed as the world’s largest skimmer, from collecting a “significant amount” of oil during a week of testing that ended Friday.*
