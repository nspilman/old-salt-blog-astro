![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/elfaro3.jpg)Yesterday afternoon, the [National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released an updated report](http://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/PR20151020.aspx) on their investigation into the sinking of *El Faro* in Hurricane Joaquin in early October. The report notes: “*In a recorded satellite phone call to the company’s emergency call center at 7:00 am EDT, the captain told the call center operator that he had a marine emergency. He reported that there was a hull breach, a scuttle had blown open, and that there was water in hold number 3. He also said that the ship had lost its main propulsion unit and the engineers could not get it going.*”  

The report also said that “*the USNS Apache, a fleet ocean tug, was outfitted with specialized equipment for this mission, and departed Little Creek, Virginia, at about 4:30 pm EDT on October 19…. The Apache is estimated to arrive at the last known position of El Faro on Saturday, October 24, to begin the search for the ship and to recover the voyage data recorder. Once the search operation begins, it is expected to take at least two weeks*.”

It is impossible to tell the extent of the hull breach reported by the captain on *El Faro*. Nevertheless, *Great Land*, a sister ship of *El Faro*, had a history of hull cracking.  In March of 1998, the [*Great Land* had a fifty foot crack](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&dat=19980314&id=4yMfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lsoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1872,2085098&hl=en) in the weather deck repaired as a result of damage in a winter storm in the Pacific.  There are also [news reports](http://blog.thenewstribune.com/business/2013/03/15/totes-ss-great-land-is-towed-away-to-the-ship-breakers-after-illustrious-tacoma-career/) of a “*crack in its hull plates that extended from one side of the ship to another*” following rough weather in the Gulf of Alaska. *SS Great Land* was scrapped in 2013.
