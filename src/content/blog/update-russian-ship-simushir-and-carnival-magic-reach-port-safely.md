Updates on two stories from the weekend:

**![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cmagic1.jpg)Carnival Magic Back in Galveston —**  [(See our previous post.)](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/10/belize-refuses-entry-to-carnival-magic-as-ebola-hysteria-continues/) After being refused entry into both Belize and Mexico, the *Carnival Magic* is back in its home port of Galveston. One passenger aboard the ship was a nurse who had handled lab specimens from Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of Ebola on October 8, at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Despite claims by [media in Belize that the passenger had symptoms of Ebola](http://belizean.com/belize-confirms-patient-with-ebola-symptoms-on-cruise-ship-off-its-coast-1814/), the nurse who quarantined herself in her stateroom, never had any symptoms and has since passed a blood test which showed no signs of Ebola.  As reported by the Washington Post: *The Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital employee and a partner boarded the ship Oct. 12 in Galveston before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated the requirement for active monitoring, the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Although the worker is healthy, the U.S. government had said it was working with the cruise line to get the ship back to America “out of an abundance of caution.”*   The [hospital published full page ads in two Texas newspapers](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/texas-hospital-apologizes-mistakes-ebola-treatment-full-page-ad-n229196) in which Barclay Berdan, hospital CEO apologized for the numerous mistakes made in handling the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States.

**Russian Ship Simushir Towed to Prince Rupert —** ([See our previous post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/10/russian-cargo-ship-simushir-under-tow-off-coast-of-british-columbia/).) The Russian general cargo ship *[Simushir](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/9179385/vessel:SIMUSHIR)* broke down late Thursday night off the coast of [Haida Gwaii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Gwaii), British Columbia, Canada. The ship was drifting toward the coastal islands in a gale when the CCGS [*Gordon Reid*](http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/Fleet/Vessel?vessel_id=67), an offshore patrol vessel based in Victoria, British Columbia, reached her when she was only 15 km off the islands.  The *Gordon Reid* was able to tow the stricken ship 30 km farther offshore before each of her three tow lines parted. The US tug, [*Barbara Foss*](http://www.mxak.org/community/barbara_foss/barbara_foss.html) arrived on Saturday and was able to take the *Simushir* under tow. This morning, they are reported to have reached a [safe harbor in Prince Rupert, Canada.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/incapacitated-russian-cargo-ship-simushir-towed-to-prince-rupert-1.2805498)
