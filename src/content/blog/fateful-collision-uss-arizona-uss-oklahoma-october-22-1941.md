![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/arizona1.jpg)I [learned yesterday](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/local/the-uss-arizona-wasnt-supposed-to-be-at-pearl-harbor-but-it-became-americas-most-famous-battleship/2016/12/06/48b33a1a-bbd9-11e6-ae79-bec72d34f8c9_video.html) that [USS *Arizona*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Arizona_\(BB-39\)#Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor) was not supposed to be in Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941. This is one of those minor facts that invariably seem to pop up to remind us that history is just as often a string of random events as someone’s grand plan. But the old battleship was indeed in Pearl Harbor, where she was hit by Japanese armor-piercing bombs. 1,177 sailors and marines died on the USS *Arizona*, representing almost half the casualties of the entire attack.

On October 22, 1941, the battleships from Pearl Harbor were on maneuvers. The battleships had been sailing in line, making 90 degree starboard turns in unison. The battleship [USS *Oklahoma*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Oklahoma_\(BB-37\)) missed a turn and rammed the USS *Arizona*. [Both ships were damaged but the *Arizona* took the worst of it](https://books.google.com/books?id=CP30dl7X_0MC&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=uss+oklahoma+collides+with+uss+arizona&source=bl&ots=E98YdzYqVL&sig=_HKXRMUKb2welGdY-T5ilfgpzrM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiP7K7R8eLQAhVJ1mMKHX_TD5QQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&q=uss%20oklahoma%20collides%20with%20uss%20arizona&f=false), ending up with a hole in her side 30 feet wide by 18 to 20 feet wide. The resulting flooding caused the ship to list 10 degrees until counter-flooding on the other side of the ship brought her upright. The *Arizona* limped back into Pearl Harbor and was put straight into the drydock. The repairs were done quickly but the casualty delayed her departure for the West Coast so that on the fateful Sunday morning in early December 1941, US *Arizona* was still in Pearl Harbor. And the rest, as the saying goes, is history.

On December 7th 1941, the USS *Arizona* was hit by four armor-piercing bombs dropped by Japanese planes. The bombs hit the forward magazines and the resulting explosions effectively tore the ship in half, killing 1,177 of the 1,512 crewmen on board at the time.

USS *Oklahoma* was also at Pearl Harbor on December 7th. The ship was hit by multiple Japanese torpedos and [capsized killing 429 of her crew.](http://www.i-16tou.com/okie/okie4.html)
