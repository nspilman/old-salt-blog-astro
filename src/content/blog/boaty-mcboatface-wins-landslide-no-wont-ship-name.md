![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/03/Nameboat.jpg)We previously [posted about how the British Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/03/name-uks-new-polar-research-ship-rrs-boaty-mcboatface/) was asking for suggestions for a name for the new polar research ship, currently under construction at Cammell Laird’s yard in Birkenhead. The suggestion period ended on April 16th and it has been announced that the most popular suggestion by a landslide is “*Boaty McBoatface*.” The tongue-in-cheek moniker won easily with 124,109 votes.

As reported by [Sky News](http://news.sky.com/story/1680628/boaty-mcboatface-sunk-by-government-minister): “Second was RRS *Poppy-Mai* – named after a 16-month-old girl with terminal cancer – with 34,371 votes. RRS *Henry Worsley*, commemorating an Antarctic explorer who died in January, was the highest placed suggestion that had scientific links, coming third. RRS *It’s Bloody Cold Here*, and RRS *David Attenborough* came fourth and fifth.”

It is, however, highly unlikely that the new 129-meter long icebreaker will ever bear the name, *Boaty McBoatface.*   The internet poll was not binding and merely solicited suggestions.  Science minister Jo Johnson acknowledged there had been some “very imaginative” names but added that he wanted something that “captures the spirit of scientific endeavour”.  Our guess is that *Boaty McBoatface* probably does not meet the minister’s criteria.
