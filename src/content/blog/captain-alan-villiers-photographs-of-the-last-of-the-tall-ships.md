[![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/03/villiers16.jpg)Alan Villiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Villiers) was the great chronicler of the last days of sail. In 1918, at the age of 15, he left home in Melborne, Australia to go to sea. His first love would always be the full rigged sailing ships that he had watched a boy sailing in and out of Melbourne. Over the next sixty years, until his death in 1982, he would sail the world’s oceans in square-rigged ships and write twenty five books and numerous articles, most about the last days of the great windjammers.

Villiers also took many remarkable photographs. Thanks to Captain Richard Bailey for pointing out this [Collection of Photographs by Alan Villiers,](http://www.jrusselljinishiangallery.com/pages/villiers-pages/villiers-photos.htm) which features hand-colored photographs from ships Villiers sailed, as a well as a succinct biography of Villers’ remarkable career. Britain’s [National Maritime Museum](http://www.rmg.co.uk/visit/exhibitions/past/villiers-display/) has posted additional photos: The [Last of the Tall Ships: Photographs by Alan Villiers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmaritimemuseum/sets/72157622912053368/with/4149290827/).
