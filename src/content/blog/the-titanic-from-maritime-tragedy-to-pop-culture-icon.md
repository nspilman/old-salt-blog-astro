[![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Titanic_artist_impr_596280b.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/076034079X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=076034079X)Ninety nine years ago today, the [RMS *Titanic*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) sank after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic with the loss of 1,517 passengers and crew.  The sinking of the *Titanic* had a major impact on  ship  operations.     The first [International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Convention_for_the_Safety_of_Life_at_Sea) (SOLAS) was adopted in 1914 as a  direct response to the sinking. [The International  Ice  Patrol](http://www.uscg-iip.org/cms/) and [AMVER](http://www.amver.com/amverhistory.asp) also trace their beginnings to the *Titanic* disaster.

In the almost 100 years since the sinking, however, the *Titanic* has moved from being a maritime tragedy to becoming a cultural icon.  The subject of hundreds of books and over twenty movies, the *Titanic* is also the basis of [“Museum/Attractions” in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee in the Great Smokey Mountains and in Branson, Missouri](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/04/05/titanic-museum-to-open-in-pigeon-forge-tennessee/).    In some respects, the actual sinking seems a backdrop to the movies and books.   “*[Earlier this month a sketch of Kate Winslet](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/history/the-sinking-of-the-titanic--99-years-on-2266347.html), used in the Hollywood blockbuster Titanic, was auctioned off for more than $16,000 in the US.*”    In the next year’s run-up to the centennial of the sinking,  the number of *Titanic* memorial events will only increase,  including a [memorial cruise on the MS *Balmoral*](http://www.newser.com/story/116497/coming-april-2012-titanic-memorial-cruise.html).

*Running for a period of two months, a number of exhibitions, talks, plays and special commemorations will recall the unique maritime history associated with the ill-fated liner.*

*‘Titanic 100’, hosted by Belfast City Council, begins on Thursday and will culminate on the 100th anniversary of the ship’s launch on Tuesday, May 31.*

*Launching the events programme will be a new photographic exhibition showcasing the work of RJ Welch, the official photographer for Harland and Wolff.*

*Through Welch’s lens, visitors will be given a remarkable glimpse of life at the yard, its scale and that of the ship, as well as an insight into the life of 1911 Belfast.*

*At the beginning of May, another exhibiton will focus on the story of the SS Nomadic, a tender to RMS Titanic.*
