[Maritime Love Affair from (mostly) above.](https://vimeo.com/393481893) from [jonathan atkin](https://vimeo.com/user41478019) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

Atkin’s comments on the video:

Married to creating compelling maritime photographs, I believe bespoke images are qualitatively necessary to tell the story about the world of shipping. It is pure drama. And my focus includes the CEO”s of shipping, THE CAPTAINS! Maritime is all that I do. In order to bring powerful insights to clients I earned a USCG Captain’s license, have thousands of hours in helicopters with multiple lessons in rotorcraft, hot air balloons and sailplanes. Additionally, I fly 5 professional drones, which were used on some of the images.

My goal is to excite ship owners, charterers, captains, crews shipyards and the public of this amazing industry. My thanks to my esteemed clients who trust me with producing branded powerful images, from Cunard Line who began \\ early on, with permission to fly a parasail around the QE2 in 1997 with images for them to the present. RCCL, Euronav, McAllister Towing, (and more) as well as Caddell Drydock and Towing. Special thanks to the USCG (Sector NY and other ports), NYPD Aviation and Sandy Hook Pilots.
