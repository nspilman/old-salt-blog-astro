![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/livestockcarrier.jpg)The Japanese Coast Guard reported receiving a [single distress call from the Panamanian flagged livestock carrier, *Gulf Livestock 1*,](https://maritime-executive.com/article/livestock-carrier-with-43-crew-feared-lost-in-typhoon-off-japan) with a crew of 43 aboard. The vessel’s last known position in the East China Sea was near Typhoon Maysak, a Category 3 storm, with winds of 115 mph. When the Japanese authorities searched for the ship, they found one surviving seafarer wearing a life jacket and an empty inflatable life raft. 

The mariner, Eduardo Sareno, the vessel’s 45-year-old chief officer, said [the ship’s engine failed before it capsized](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54008087) after being hit by a wave. Sareno also said that the crew had been instructed to put on lifejackets and that he jumped into the water. He said he did not see any other crew members before he was rescued. Sareno was reported to have been in the water for almost 24 hours before he was located by the Japanese Coast Guard.

The [*Gulf Livestock 1*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:857992/mmsi:353947000/imo:9262883/vessel:GULF_LIVESTOCK_1#) had departed Napier, New Zealand on August 14 bound for Tangshan, China. She was reported to be sailing at a speed of 8 knots due to arrive in China on September 4. She carried a crew of two Australians, two New Zealanders, and 39 Filipinos, as well as a cargo of 5,800 cattle. 

The 440-foot long 8,372 DWT ship was operated by Gulf Navigation Holding, headquartered in Dubai, UAE.
