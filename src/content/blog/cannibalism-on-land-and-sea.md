17th-century remains of a young girl excavated from Jamestown, Virginia, show evidence of cannibalism in the colony.

Last week, the news broke that evidence of cannibalism had been found at the [Jamestown colony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia) in Virginia. Cut and sawing marks have been found on the skull and leg bones of a young woman, suggesting that her flesh was stripped and eaten after death.  Jamestown was the first permanent English settlement in the Americas.  The cannibalism is thought to date from the “starving time” of 1609–1610.  The findings were a confirmation of what had been recorded in various accounts of the “starving time, ” when only Only 61 of 500 colonists survived.  Nevertheless, [there was considerable disagreement among historians](http://www.academia.edu/428792/The_tragicall_historie_Cannibalism_and_Abundance_in_Colonial_Jamestown) whether the accounts were accurate, or merely propaganda spread by various factions associated with the settlement.  The physical evidence appears now to have largely settled the dispute.

[Evidence of Cannibalism Found at Jamestown Colony](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/05/01/evidence-of-cannibalism-found-at-jamestown-colony)

As pointed out by Richard Sugg writing in the Guardian – the [Jamestown cannibalism should be no surprise; it is just part of human history](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/05/cannibalism-history-europe-famine-shipwreck).  Cannibalism at sea, in dire emergencies, such as a ship wreck, was almost considered acceptable.

When the yacht [*Mignonette* sank in the South Atlantic](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/07/nautical-coincidence-lifeboat-morality-richard-parker-and-the-mignonette/) in 1884, the captain, two crew members and a cabin boy, named Richard Parker, were left drifting in a lifeboat.  The cabin boy reportedly drank salt water to assuage his thirst and slipped into a coma.  The practical, if literally, blood-thirsty captain decided that there was less chance of spoilage if they killed the boy before he died. So, they killed and ate the cabin boy. The three were rescued four days later by the German sailing barque Montezuma, named fittingly enough after the Aztec king who practiced ritual cannibalism.

When returned to shore, the captain gave a full and frank account of what happened in the lifeboat, believing that they were fully justified in killing and eating Richard Parker under the [Customs of the Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custom_of_the_Sea).  The British court, however, disagreed.  Their trial, [R v Dudley and Stephens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Dudley_and_Stephens), established a legal precedent in common law around the world, that necessity is no defense to a charge of murder. The three men were found guilty, though their sentences were later commuted to six months hard labor.

If the name Richard Parker sounds familiar, if may be because Yann Martel’s 2001 novel,  [*Life of Pi*](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/life-of-pi-yann-martel/1100302344?ean=9780156027328), the novel’s hero, Pi, is trapped in a lifeboat with a tiger, named Richard Parker.
