Artist Josh Beckman’s “Sea Nymph” in LA’s Machine Project gallery is nothing less that a shipwreck in an art gallery.  To accompany the installation, the gallery has hosted a series of nautical-themed events, performances, lectures, and workshops, as well as an opera by and for dogs. Sea-dogs, we hope. The exhibition continues through October 8th.
