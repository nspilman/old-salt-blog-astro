![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Tres-Hombres_1_Michel_Floch.jpg)Commercial sail has not yet returned, but there are interesting niche players who are doing what they can to change that. The sailing brigantine [*Tres Hombres*](http://fairtransport.eu/) recently carried 10 tons of French wine from Brest to Copenhagen for delivery to [Noma](http://noma.dk/), which has been rated as the “World’s Best Restaurant” for the past seven years by the [World’s 50 Best Restaurants](http://www.theworlds50best.com/awards/1-50-winners/noma/).   The 10 tons of wine include wines from 13 French biodynamic winemakers. The shipment by sail is estimated to have saved close to 5 tons of CO2 emissions.  The shipment was arranged by [TransOceanic Wind Transport](http://www.towt.eu/)

*TransOceanic Wind Transport and the “Tres Hombres” promote the revival of sail shipping. The “Tres Hombres”, the world’s only engine-free cargo sailing ship, is the symbol of this revival. She constitutes a first step that garners positive energy and proves transoceanic engine-free shipping is feasible today.*

*In our finite world, the revival of cargo sailing ships is inevitable. The “Tres Hombres” ships across oceans products wich raise the issue of “How will shipping undergo the energy transition?”*

*Dramatically reducing emissions*  
*TransOceanic Wind Transport is a sailing freight transport company that offers a concrete and alternative solution to the problems of shipping greenhouse emissions and liquid fuel price hikes. It shows that the 4% of world emissions due to ocean shipping – about 20% of Denmark’s emissions – can be dramatically reduced by applying modern technology to the old tradition of great tall ships.*

*Winemakers taking part to the operation: Philippe Gourdon – Anjou ; Bruno Rochard – Anjou ; Mark Angeli – Anjou ; Francois David – Anjou ; Toby Bainbridge – Anjou ; Olivier Cousin – Anjou ; Jo Landron – Muscadet ; Guy Bossard – Muscadet ; Michel Augé – Touraine ; Sebastien Riffault – Sancerre ; Alexandre Bain – Sancerre*
