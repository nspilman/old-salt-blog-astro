The [CBC’s Land & Sea](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/) is without question the favorite television program that I have never watched on television. While I cannot get Canadian broadcasting on my television, Land & Sea fortunately also puts their [programming on-line](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/). We have previously posted about their programs “[Nova Scotia Schooners](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/land-and-sea-nova-scotia-schooners/)” and “[Rumrunners](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/02/rum-running-documentary-on-cbcs-land-sea/).”

This Sunday, December 9th at noon, [Land and Sea](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/) is featuring “[Shipbuilding in the Maritimes](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/2012/12/shipbuilding-in-the-maritimes.html)” a half hour documentary that focuses on the once-thriving shipbuilding centers in Atlantic Canada were once the most vibrant, productive, and profitable shipbuilding region in the world.
