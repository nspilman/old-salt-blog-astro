![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/meerwald-1.jpg)I wished that I could have sailed aboard a classic schooner when I was a kid.  For those in the New York/New Jersey Area, The [Bayshore Discovery Project](http://www.ajmeerwald.org/) is sponsoring two [five-day summer sailing camps](http://www.ajmeerwald.org/html/camp_maritime.htm) aboard the classic oyster schooner (and the official Tall Ship of the State of New Jersey) *[A.J. Meerwald](http://www.ajmeerwald.org/)* for teens from 13-17.  Campers will learn to raise and furl sails, coil lines, navigate, and steer the boat. With deckwashes, sea chanteys, knots, and standing watch, campers will truly become tall ship sailors.

The first sail departs on July 8 from Liberty State Park, traveling north toward New York, ending in New London, CT. The second departs on July 22, traveling south ending in Beach Haven on New Jersey’s Long Beach Island. The cost is $750 per camper and includes meals and on board lodging. For more information, call (856)-785-2060.  [Or click here to learn more.](http://www.ajmeerwald.org/html/camp_maritime.htm)

There is also a [Sailor for a Day program](http://www.ajmeerwald.org/html/camp_day.htm) for kids from 10-16 years old.   The one day program will include hoisting the sails, hauling in the trawl line, learning about local marine life, navigating the ship, tying knots, swabbing the deck, and singing sea shanties. The cost is $70. Call (856) 785-2060 ext. 100 to make a reservation. [Click here to learn more](http://www.ajmeerwald.org/html/camp_day.htm).
