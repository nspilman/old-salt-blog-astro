![Charles-W.-Morgan4](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/07/Charles-W.-Morgan4.jpg)After a five year restoration, the 1841 built whaleship [*Charles W. Morgan*](http://www.mysticseaport.org/visit/explore/morgan/) is returning to the water at the [Mystic Seaport Museum](http://www.mysticseaport.org/), tomorrow at 2 PM. The museum has set up a live web cam for those of us who can’t make it to Mystic, Connecticut to see the launch in person.  Award-winning documentary filmmaker Ric Burns will deliver the keynote address at the public ceremony, at which point the ship will be lowered into the Mystic River. Once launched, museum shipwrights will complete the restoration with the vessel in the water in preparation for her ceremonial 38th Voyage to historic ports of New England in 2014.
