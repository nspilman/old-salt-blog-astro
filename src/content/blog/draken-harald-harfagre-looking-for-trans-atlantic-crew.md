![dragonharold](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/12/dragonharold.jpg)We recently [posted about the possibility of purchasing a custom Viking longship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/12/replica-viking-longship-stop-gift-shop/) from the [Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark](http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/).  If that doesn’t fit your budget, or if you don’t want to have to line up thirty to one hundred able bodied Norseman to help row, here is an alternative. *[Draken Harald Hårfagre](http://www.dragonharaldfairhair.com/)* is looking for crew.

*Draken Harald Hårfagre* (*Dragon Harald Fairhair*, in English) is described as the largest and most authentic Viking warship since 1200 AD.  Built between 2010 and 2012 in Haugesund, Norway, the Viking longship is 115 feet long, 26 feet wide and is propelled by a single square sail or by 25 pairs of oars. In May of 2016, Draken Harald Hårfagre will sail from its home port in Norway across the North Atlantic Ocean to the shores of North America, by way of the Shetlands, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland. They are now taking applications for crew for the epic voyage. From their [website](http://www.drakenexpeditionamerica.com/application-for-volunteers/):

*Do you want to join the crew? The voyage from Norway to America will be a challenging and demanding but unique experience. It is important to be of good health and have a strong physique. Draken Harald Hårfagre is an open ship, there is no under deck and the only shelter is a small tent. It will be cold, wet and hard work. We will need crew from April to September 2016, and we want our crew to be a part of the project for at least 2 months at a time.*  [Click here to go to the application](http://www.drakenexpeditionamerica.com/application-for-volunteers/).

Here is a short video of the longship sailing at upwards of 14 knots in the North Sea.
