![guardianreef1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/01/guardianreef1.jpg)The Navy has announced that the minesweeper, [USS *Guardian*, which ran up on Tubbataha reef](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/01/minesweeper-uss-guardian-runs-aground-on-reef-in-philippines-tubbataha-national-marine-park/) in the Philippines Sula Sea two weeks ago, will be cut up in place and hauled away.  The reason given is that the approach will “[involve the least damage to the Tubbataha Reef.](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57566611/navy-uss-guardian-to-be-dismantled-after-running-aground-on-philippines-tubbataha-reef/)”   They had previously determined that the fiberglass sheathed wooden ship was [too damaged to float if towed off the reef](http://news.msn.co.nz/worldnews/8598657/us-to-pump-fuel-from-stuck-minesweeper).  Depending on the availability of crane vessels, the Navy may have had no other choice.

All indications are that the electronic charts had the reef miss-plotted by roughly eight nautical miles.  The larger question, however, is what the minesweeper was doing so close to the reef which is part of the Philippines’ [Tubbataha National Marine Park](http://www.tubbatahareef.org/) and a designated [World Heritage Site](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/653).  Reportedly, the [ship was warned that it was in protected area and that it was approaching the reef](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/291269/news/nation/uss-guardian-ignored-warnings-it-was-nearing-reef-tubbataha-official), but apparently ignored the warnings.  Thus far the grounding is reported to have damaged around 1,000 square meters of coral reef or about 1% of the reef withing the park.  Philippine President Benigno Aquino III is demanding an explanation as to why the ship grounded onthe reef.
