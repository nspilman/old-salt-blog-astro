![heroproject](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/06/heroproject.jpg)The [historic lighthouse tender *Lilac*](http://www.lilacpreservationproject.org/) is celebrating the Summer season with a exhibition of Jonathan Atkin’s *[Hero Project](http://www.heroproject.us/)*.  *Hero Project* is a selection from Jonathan’s on-going work-in-progress collaboration with dance artists aboard historic ships.  His mission is to increase visibility of our maritime heritage by reaching new non-maritime audiences.  In the exhibition, dancers athletically grace the gritty vessels in oversize photographs mounted throughout *Lilac*, from the bridge to the engine room.  From the [*Hero Project* website](http://www.heroproject.us/#/about-the-project): *This project is no fashion shoot. Nor a model shoot. It is not a ship shoot. It is a poem, a ballad, a celebration of historic ships through the energy of dance and dancer’s perceptions that may encourage the public to navigate through the fog of underappreciation for both historic ships and dancers. Both historic ships representing our neglected maritime heritage and dancers, are HEROES!*  

The [*Hero Project* will be on display aboard the *Lilac*](http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=2a197f1ae59cfefb2ce14c8be&id=8bc120945f&e=d22827da0e) through June 30. The *Lilac* is moored at Pier 25 in Manhattan on the Hudson River.
