![skeleton3.jpg-1-of-1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/03/skeleton3.jpg-1-of-1.jpg)A new exhibit has just opened at the [American Museum of Natural History](http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/current-exhibitions/whales-giants-of-the-deep) in New York. While  perhaps not as controversial as the exhibit at the [Vancouver Maritime Museum which we posted recently](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/03/vancouver-maritime-museum-stephen-colbert-whale-bone-porn/), it includes many whales bones, but, at least to our knowledge, no [whale bone porn](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/03/vancouver-maritime-museum-stephen-colbert-whale-bone-porn/).  The new exhibit, [Whales: Giants of the Deep](http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/current-exhibitions/whales-giants-of-the-deep), includes more than 20 skulls and skeletons from a range of whale species, including a skeleton of a male sperm whale that measures 58 feet long. Visitors are also invited to climb through the replica of a blue whale’s heart.  The exhibit, which runs through Jan. 5, 2014, is on loan from the [Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa](http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/pages/default.aspx).
