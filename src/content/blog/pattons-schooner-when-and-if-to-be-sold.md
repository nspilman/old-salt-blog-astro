When and If

In 1939 then Colonel [General George S. Patton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Patton) had a 63’5″ John Alden designed schooner built for himself and his wife.  Another world war was looming on the horizon and Patton said that he planned to sail the schooner, “When the war is over, and if I survive.”  He named the schooner [“*When and If.*“](http://www.schoonerwhenandif.com/) Ironically, Patton survived the fighting but died in a traffic accident just as the war ended.  
  
I have always had a hard time imagining “Blood and Guts” Patton sailing an Alden schooner.  That may only reflect the limitations of my own imagination.  “*When and If”* stayed in the Patton family until 1970 when it was donated to the Landmark School north of Boston, where for over 20 years, she was used in sail training programs for dyslexic children. (Patton himself was dyslexic.)  The schooner was almost lost in 1990 when she broke free of her moorings during a November gale.   After being hauled off the rocks she was rebuilt by the [Gannon & Benjamin Boatyard](http://gannonandbenjamin.com/) of Martha’s Vineyard.   See our previous [post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/13/schooner-building-a-wooden-boat-on-marthas-vineyard-a-review/).   “*When and If”* has been sailing ever since.

Sadly, we have read that she is now on the market due to an impending divorce.   We can only wish her current and future owners well and hope that the lovely schooner continues sailing for years to come.
