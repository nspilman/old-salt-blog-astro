![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/oyster.jpg)As one who is very fond of oyster-flavored oysters, I am not sure that a raspberry, ginger, shallot or muscat flavored oyster is necessarily a good idea.  Nevertheless, French oyster farmer Joffrey Dubault, 29, is working to bring these [flavored oysters](https://www.thelocal.fr/20171010/young-french-farmer-launches-worlds-first-flavoured-oysters) to the world. To achieve this culinary alchemy, Dubault places oysters in 400-litre trays which contain water infused with the chosen flavor. 

“This water is filtered in a few hours, depending on the flavor. It’s really a natural cycle, we don’t intervene with the product at all,” Dubault explains. 

[The Local](https://www.thelocal.fr/20171010/young-french-farmer-launches-worlds-first-flavoured-oysters) reports, “if these aren’t quite the flavors you’d like with your oysters, his business So’ooh is currently developing even more unusual perfumes for the luxury seafood, including truffle and chocolate for special occasions like Christmas and Valentine’s Day. “
