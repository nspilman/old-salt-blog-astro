[Artist required for The Tall Ships Races 2011 onboard Swan](http://www.sailtraininginternational.org/news/article/mode_unpublished_item_100524.htm)

*In a first for The Tall Ships Races, the former herring drifter Swan will host an artist in residence for the whole of The Tall Ships Races 2011. In a project called, ‘LK 243 Undersail’, the Swan Trust with partners, Shetland Arts and Taigh Chearsabhagh Arts Centre, North Uist has received funding from Creative Scotland and Scotland’s Islands Fund. The project will focus on Swan, its crew, the host ports and the people involved in The Tall Ships Races 2011.*  
  
*The project has been two years in planning and is seeking an artist of international standing to be based on Swan for a six week period, the project title, ‘LK 243 Undersail’, being taken from Swan’s registration number. Speaking after learning of the successful funding bids, chairman of the Swan Trust, Allister Rendall said, “We are delighted to have been awarded this funding which allows something new and innovative to take place on Swan. Swan has become an iconic symbol of Shetland and we are confident that the artist will help promote Swan and Shetland all the way from Ireland to Sweden.”*

*Given the interest that the Tall Ships generate in the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia, it is hoped that artists from various countries will apply for the position.*

*The successful artist will spend the race series aboard Swan and then have four weeks studio time to prepare for an exhibition of their work. It is hoped that an exhibition of completed works will be held in Shetland and North Uist.*

*If artists are interested in applying they should contact Shetland Arts, **[www.shetlandarts.org](http://www.shetlandarts.org/)** and Closing date for applications: 5pm, Fri 15 April 2011*

*Interviews: Thursday 5 and Friday 6 May 2011 in Shetland.*
