[Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/)‘s new novel, [*Turn A Blind Eye*](http://www.historicnavalfiction.com/general/merchantman-fiction/list/3191-turn-a-blind-eye), moves away from his ‘Fighting Sail’ series and the Royal Navy to the world of smuggling on the South Coast of England. It follows Commander Griffin and the crew of the Revenue cutter *Bee* as they battle to rid Newhaven of an entrenched gang of snugglers who hold sway over the town.

Bond is a master storyteller and he weaves a well written plot that explores the divided loyalties of the townsfolk who support small scale smuggling but are fearful of the gangs strength. The narrative vividly recounts life in a small fishing town where the Revenue men seek to combat a practice that is draining the country of money to fight the war against France and even sometimes supplying the enemy, whilst their fast agile cutter is often outgunned by the smugglers.

As usual Bond’s research shines through as he subtly educates us about smuggling in a fast paced hard to put down book. Highly Recommended.
