![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/08/wavelinemagnet.jpg)[Sea Wave Energy Ltd](https://swel.eu/), a Cyprus and UK-based R&D startup, has been working for the last decade to develop the world’s most efficient, low-cost wave energy converter. 

Earlier this year, [the company unveiled the prototype](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/floating-device-generate-power-waves) called the [Waveline Magnet](https://swel.eu/#features), which is fabricated from a series of floating platforms linked to each other that generate energy by undulating in ocean waves.

With regards to survivability at sea, the company is confident that the spine-like mobility of the device will allow it to move with the waves rather than oppose them, increasing the life of the device.

Since the device can also be made using recycled materials, it should also not be a burden to the environment like the solar panels or wind turbines are proving to be.

Under the right conditions, the company claims that a single wave energy converter could generate as much as 100 MW of power, and its low cost of energy production puts it at par with fossil fuels already.
