Clipper City

In January [we posted that the Hudson River Park Trust was seeking proposals to dock historic vessels](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/17/a-pier-for-historic-ships-on-the-hudson/) on the newly refurbished Pier 25 in the Hudson River off Tribecca.   Earlier this month the the [Hudson River Park Trust](http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/index.asp) announced that the [1907  Tug *Pegasus*](http://www.tugpegasus.org/), the [1933 lighthouse tender *Lilac*](http://lilacpreservationproject.org/) and the 1984 [tall ship *Clipper City*](http://www.manhattanbysail.com/Sails/The-Clipper-City-Tall-Ship/), a historic replica, had been selected to be the first vessels to dock at the pier.

*The Lilac Preservation Project, which runs the 1933 lighthouse tender Lilac, plans to co-host music concerts, circus performances and other festivities at Pier 25. The Lilac will arrive at the Tribeca pier by mid-May, in time for a scheduled May 21 onboard wedding. The craft has been docked on Pier 40’s north side, at West Houston St., since 2003.*

*The 1907 harbor tugboat Pegasus will move to Pier 25 in the summer. Its owner, the Tug Pegasus Preservation Project, plans to organize workshops, guided tours of the ship and a speakers series focused on maritime culture. While most of the programming will be free, some will have nominal entrance fees, depending on staffing needs, according to executive director Pamela Hepburn. The organization also hopes to schedule visits to the tug for neighborhood youths.*

*Clipper City, a steel replica of a 19th-century wooden schooner of the same name, is the largest active sailboat in New York, and one of the largest operating passenger sailboats in America, according to its owner, Tom Berton.*
