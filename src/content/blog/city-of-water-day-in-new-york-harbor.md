![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/07/Site-Image-Corrected.jpg)The City of New York is a city of islands, large and small, floating in a vast harbor and waterway. Only one of the five boroughs is on the mainland and that even borough, the Bronx, is on a peninsula, with water on three sides. The city and the metropolitan area of 20 million people only exist because of the harbor, the Hudson River estuary, and neighboring rivers and sounds.  Once again the [Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance](http://www.waterfrontalliance.org/) is presenting “[City of Water Day](http://www.cityofwaterday.org/)” to celebrate the mighty New York – New Jersey harbor and to witness the potential of the waterfront.  The festivities will be held on [Governors Island](http://govisland.com/html/home/home.shtml) and [Liberty State Park](http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/liberty.html) from 10:00 AM to 4:00PM on July 14th.  Activities are also scheduled in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx and on the Jersey side of the Hudson River.  [Click here for details of local activities.](http://www.cityofwaterday.org/neighborhood)
