![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/12/uscgccampbell.jpg)Sometimes the events of the day seem downright surreal. Yesterday, I read about the US Coast Guard cutter *Campbell* which [returned to the Portsmouth Naval Base from a three month Pacific patrol](https://www.wmur.com/article/crew-based-at-portsmouth-naval-shipyard-seizes-150-million-worth-of-cocaine/25686268) in which it seized more than 11,000 pounds of cocaine, worth about $159 million. Nevertheless, the personnel aboard the *Campbell* are [not currently being paid for their work due to the current partial Federal shutdown](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/12/42000-us-coast-guard-personnel-working-without-pay-during-shutdown/). Nationally, the 42,000 Coast Guardsmen and women are the only military personnel working without pay. Thousands of Coast Guard civilian personnel, who support the Coast Guard military personnel, have also been furloughed without pay.

Of course, the reason that the government is shut down is that current occupant of the Oval Office has thrown a temper tantrum over a wall on the border with Mexico, a wall that he swore Mexico would pay for. The reasons that he claims the wall is necessary are twofold — to stop illegal immigration and to block the importation of drugs.

The fact is that [cross-border illegal immigration](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/05/568546381/arrests-for-illegal-border-crossings-hit-46-year-low) is at near 50 year low. Also, most undocumented immigrants [arrive in the US legally and overstay their visas](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/visa-overstays-outnumber-illegal-border-crossings-trend-expected-continue-n730216). A wall won’t stop them, as most arrive by plane.

Will a wall stop the movement of drugs? No. According to Rear Admiral Christopher Tomney, director of Joint Interagency Task Force South for the US Coast Guard, “[well over 95% of the drugs are moving on the water](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34934574) via container ships, non-commercial vessels, pleasure boats, sailboats, fishing boats.”

And here is where the surrealism kicks in. US Coast Guard personnel are working without pay while serving on the front lines of the war on drugs, interdicting literally billions of dollars worth of illegal drugs each year. The USCGC *Campbell’s* recent success is not an isolated event. In September, the [USCGC *Seneca* seized $61 million](https://navaltoday.com/2018/09/26/uscg-cutter-home-after-seizing-61-million-worth-of-drugs/) worth of drugs, while in November the crew of the [USCGC *James* recovered around 18.5 tons of cocaine](https://www.wbtw.com/news/state-regional/-500m-worth-of-cocaine-seized-by-sc-based-coast-guard-cutter/1609399811) worth an estimated $500 million. 

In the last three fiscal years, the US Coast Guard has interdicted almost [700 tons of cocaine](https://www.businessinsider.com/coast-guard-offload-500-million-in-cocaine-seized-in-pacific-ocean-2018-11) with a street value approaching $20 billion dollars.  

So we have a situation where the Coast Guard personnel, who are really stopping illegal drugs, aren’t getting paid over the funding of a needless wall which won’t stop significant quantities of illegal drugs.

The satirical military blog, [DuffelBlog](https://www.duffelblog.com/2018/12/coast-guard-begins-reselling-seized-cocaine-amid-government-shutdown/), has a suggestion to address the problem — sell the seized drugs to pay wages.

With the Coast Guard being the only branch of the military whose members may go without during the current government shutdown, the service has decided to resell the nearly $1 billion dollars worth of cocaine seized in the past six months to supplement pay for the 42,000 men and women on active duty.

“We doubt legislation will be passed by Friday, Dec. 28, which will keep us from getting our scheduled pay check for 31 Dec.,” Chief Warrant Officer Kevin Francescon said in a statement. “However, we have a shit ton of drugs. And if we can capture it, we damn well can sell it back for twice the price to the right buyers.”

Again, this is satire.
