![1889733802](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/11/1889733802.jpg)In March of this year, [we posted about the repeated blackouts suffered on the USS *Freedom*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/03/uss-freedom-limping-toward-singapore-the-us-navys-sorry-lcs-saga-continues/) as it made its way to a deployment in Singapore.  Recently the [ship was delayed due to failures in its water jet controls](http://www.stripes.com/news/littoral-combat-ship-sidelined-again-by-maintenance-issue-1.252620). In October it was sidelined by [failures in the hydraulic systems](http://www.stripes.com/500m-littoral-combat-ship-s-departure-delayed-again-by-maintenance-issue-1.249934). In July, the ship had generator and coolant system problems.  In addition to the problems with the mechanical and control systems, the ship has suffered [repeated hull cracking](http://www.dodbuzz.com/2012/04/24/the-navys-hull-crack-problem/), which have limited speeds.

[USS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Freedom_\(LCS-1\)) *[Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Freedom_\(LCS-1\))* is the first of one of two designs of the U.S. Navy’s [Littoral Combat Ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littoral_combat_ship).  A recent GAO report has also questioned whether the [LCS ships’ communications systems are adequate](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-11-19/littoral-ship-to-shore-communications-seen-deficient-gao-says) for the networked missions intended.   A report from earlier this year suggested that the [LCS may nor be survivable in combat.](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/01/littoral-combat-ship/)

The LCS are intended as agile coastal patrol craft designed for anti-mine warfare, anti-submarine warfare, and surface warfare missions; as well as humanitarian relief. The Navy has planned on ordering 52 of the vessels for $40 billion.  Given budgetary concerns, project cost overruns and questions of reliability, [Defense Department budget planners have suggested that the Navy buy as few as 32 of the vessels](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303460004579191950780107222).
