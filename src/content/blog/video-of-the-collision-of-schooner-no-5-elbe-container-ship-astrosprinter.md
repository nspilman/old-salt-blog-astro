[Kurz vor der Kollision mit “No. 5 Elbe” am 08.06.2019](https://youtu.be/aXrTvVh4NOs)

Commentary from [NDR.De](https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/hamburg/No-5-Elbe-Video-zeigt-Moment-vor-Kollision,lotsenschoner174.html): The video, which was obviously taken on board the pilot \[schooner\], shows the “No. 5 Elbe” on the northern and thus wrong side of the fairway sailing high upwind, already on a collision course with the freighter. Shortly before the accident, the command “hard port” is heard – the only right command to avoid the freighter. However, the people at the pilot’s powerful tiller push the tiller in the wrong direction and steer the historic wooden ship directly in front of the bow of the freighter. A fatal mistake.
