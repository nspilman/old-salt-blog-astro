If you are like me, relatively busy yet easily distracted and very fond of paintings, drawings and old photos of ships, you should probably skip this post.  The New York Public Library Digital galley has a wonderful collection of  drawings, paintings and photographs of all sorts of ships available on-line.   A search on the word “ship” results in 2,097 images.   A great place to loose an hour or two while browsing.   Consider yourself warned.
