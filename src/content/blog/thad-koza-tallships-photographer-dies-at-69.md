![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/koza.jpg)We [posted about his new Tall Ships calendar](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/10/31/tall-ships-2011-calendar-by-thad-koza/) about a month ago.  One of his calendars is hanging on my wall waiting for the new year to begin.   Sadly, we learned last night that Thad Koza has died of cancer. In addition to his beautiful calendars, Koza also published a number of books, including [Tall Ships: The International Guide](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1559493135?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1559493135).
