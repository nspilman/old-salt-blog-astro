![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wildeyes.jpg)In 2010, 16-year-old [Abby Sunderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_Sunderland) was attempting to become the youngest person to sail around the world, non-stop singlehanded. It didn’t go well. Sunderland’s boat, *Wild Eyes*, an Open 40 class racer, [capsized and was dismasted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/abby-sunderland-located-alive-aboard-disabled-sailboat/) in a remote region of the southern Indian Ocean. Abby Sunderland was [rescued by a French fishing vessel](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/abby-sunderland-rescued-by-french-fishing-vessel-ile-de-la-reunion/) but *Wild Eyes* was abandoned to the mercy of the sea.

Now over eight years later, *Wild Eyes* has reappeared off Australia’s [Kangaroo Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island), over [3,000 nautical miles](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-girl-sailor/sailor-abby-sunderland-found-safe-in-indian-ocean-idUSTRE6595L120100611) from where it was abandoned. *Wild Eyes* was found adrift, bottom-up, without her keel.  Initial reports from 2010, suggested that the keel had been lost in the capsize as well as the rig. Later reports said that the keel was intact. If it was intact, at some point in the last eight years, the keel broke off.

How did *Wild Eyes* survive so long in some of the roughest seas on earth? 

*Wild Eyes**,* was originally *BT Velocity,* built to race in Class III of the [2002 Around Alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velux_5_Oceans_Race#The_Around_Alone,_2002) race. (The Around Alone race was subsequently renamed the [Velux Five Oceans race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velux_5_Oceans_Race).) Like all Open 40s class racers, the boat was designed to be self-righting and unsinkable. The boat incorporates buoyant material capable of supporting 130% of the displacement of the boat, so even if holed, the boat was intended to be safer than a life raft.

Unlike most Open 40s, *BT Velocity* was a built with a fixed rather than a canting keel, reportedly for budgetary reasons. 

Scott Jutson, the designer of *BT Velocity*, describes the boat in an article in Soundings a few months after Sunderland was rescued. He writes:

*Structurally BT Velocity was designed to exceed ABS/ORC requirements and had structural supplementation, which we carried over from our previous single-handed designs, including a tear-away bow section in the event of collision. The steel keel was fitted into the boat as a spar and was designed to withstand a high-speed grounding without damage to the surrounding composite structure.*

*The rig was a stable carbon, swept spreader design fitted with running topmast and check stays for extra stability in extreme conditions. BT Velocity completed* the *2002 Ar*ound *Alone without incident.*  

There are ongoing discussions about whether to not scuttle sailboats by opening through-hulls before abanding then at sea, so as to not create a derelict and a hazard to navigation. Even with open seacocks, *Wild Eyes* would have stayed afloat.

After the loss of the *Titanic*, to say that no vessel is unsinkable has become almost a cliche. Nevertheless, *Wild Eyes* and other Open 40 racing boats may be the exceptions.
