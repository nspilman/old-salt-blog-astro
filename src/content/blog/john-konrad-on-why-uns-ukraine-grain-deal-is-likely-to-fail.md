At the end of July, [Ukraine and Russia signed “mirror” deals that allowed Kyiv to resume exports of grain](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62268070) through the Black Sea. The agreement was purported to allow millions of tonnes of grain, currently trapped in Ukraine by the war, to be exported. 

The blockade of Ukraine’s grain has caused a global food crisis with wheat-based products like bread and pasta becoming more expensive and cooking oils and fertilizer also increasing in price.

Will the deal work? Here is a [gCaptain video](https://www.youtube.com/c/gCaptainNews) in which John Konrad discusses the agreement made with Russia, Turkey, and the United Nations.
