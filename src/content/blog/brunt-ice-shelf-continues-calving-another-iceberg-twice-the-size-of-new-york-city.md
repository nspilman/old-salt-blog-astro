![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/01/BruntA-81.jpg)In late February 2022, an [iceberg with an area of about 490 square miles](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/02/iceberg-larger-than-new-york-city-calves-from-brunt-ice-shelf/), or slightly less than twice the size of the City of New York, calved from the [Brunt Ice Shelf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunt_Ice_Shelf) in the Weddell Sea section of Antarctica. Now, just under a year later, [another iceberg has calved](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150880/antarcticas-brunt-ice-shelf-finally-breaks) from the Brunt Ice Shelf. The new iceberg, with an area of 1550 square kilometers (about 600 square miles), is also roughly twice the size of New York City. The [U.S. National Ice Center](https://usicecenter.gov/PressRelease/Iceberga81) has named it Iceberg A-81. According to the [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/brunt-ice-shelf-in-antarctica-calves-giant-iceberg/) (BAS), the break occurred late on January 22, 2023.

The good news is that the split is a natural process and is not linked to climate change, the British Antarctic Survey says.
