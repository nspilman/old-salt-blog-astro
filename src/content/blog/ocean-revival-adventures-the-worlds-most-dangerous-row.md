![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rb2.jpg)While getting our boat ready to move to her summer mooring, I had the good fortune to meet [Ian Clinton and Simon Chalk](https://oceanrevivaladventures.com/the-crew/), members of the Ocean Revival Adventures crew, waiting with their ocean rowing boats at Liberty Landing in New York harbor for a suitable weather window to set off on what has been dubbed the “world’s most dangerous row.”

From their [website](https://oceanrevivaladventures.com/):  Ocean Revival 2020 is a team of serving and former serving Royal Marine Commandos, who have fought alongside each other in 45 Commando. They have now teamed up to take the fight against plastic by rowing across the North Atlantic Ocean, rowing a route that has never been completed before and one that is statistically the most dangerous and arduous ocean row to attempt.

The Ocean Revival team plans to row across the North Atlantic Ocean, a feat that only 57 people in history have achieved. The crossing has been attempted a total of 72 times, with 29 successes, over 43 failures, and which has sadly taken 6 ocean rowers’ lives.

None have rowed from New York to London – Ocean Revival aims to be the first. The epic row across the North Atlantic will total approximately 3,700 miles from the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City to Tower Bridge in London.

Plastic in our Oceans is an astronomical problem that is hugely effecting the ecological systems that are vital not just to Marine Life but also Human. According to ‘Science Journal’, 12.7 million tonnes of plastic enter our oceans every year, causing havoc with our oceans food systems and Marine Life, and the problem is only getting worse.

Ocean Revival 2020 is fighting back by attempting to raise awareness and help keep momentum in the fight against plastic in our oceans; a fight the team would love you to join them on.

Ocean Revival is supporting the charities [Plastic Oceans](https://plasticoceans.uk/) and the [Royal Marines Charity](https://rma-trmc.org/).
