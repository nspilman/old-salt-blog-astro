Captain Mary B. Greene and her husband Captain Gordon Greene

Some say that [Captain Mary Becker Greene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Becker_Greene) is still watching out for the riverboat *[Delta Queen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Queen#Hauntings)*. Captain “Ma” Greene served for almost sixty years as master and pilot of some of the finest steamboats on the inland rivers. She died in her cabin aboard the *Delta Queen* in 1949. Some say that she never left. Employees and guests have reported sounds and activities aboard, particularly around her cabin.

Mary Becker married Captain Gordon C. Greene in 1890 and set up housekeeping on his Cincinnati packet boat, the [*H. K. Bedford*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._K._Bedford). In 1896, she earned her pilot’s license and took command of the [riverboat *Argand*.](http://www.riverboatdaves.com/riverboats/a-2.html) She and her husband built the Greene Line, which at its peak operated twelve riverboats carrying freight and passengers on the Ohio and its tributaries. When Gordon Greene died in 1927, two her sons, Tom, who has been born on riverboat, and Chris, helped their mother run the company.

During World War II, the freight business stayed strong, but after the war, the passenger ‘cruise’ business picked up. Tom Greene bought the *Delta Queen* and brought it from California through the Panama Canal to the Mississippi and then the Ohio River. Mary Becker Greene assumed command in 1948. She died a year later on the boat.

Those who have reported seeing or hearing the spirit of Mary Becker Greene on the *Delta Queen* suggest that her presence is  benevolent and watchful.  In December 1984, Captain Mike Williams was aboard the *Delta Queen* as a caretaker. No one else was on the boat. He was asleep, when he said someone whispered “Psst” in his ear. He says he felt the person’s breath. He didn’t get up at first, and then it happened twice more. He got up, but saw no one. He decided to check the cabins, and found all locked but one — Room 109, the room where Capt. Mary Becker Greene had died. He continued checking the boat and found a leak in the engine room, which could have sunk the *Delta Queen* if he had not caught it in time.  He believes that Mary Becker Greene warned him of the flooding.
