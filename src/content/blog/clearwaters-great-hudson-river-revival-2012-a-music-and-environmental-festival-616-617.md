![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/06/clearwater-festival-logo.jpg)If you are anywhere near the the village of Croton-on-Hudson, NY (about 30 miles north of New York City), [Clearwater’s Great Hudson River Revival 2012](http://www.clearwater.org/festival/aboutfestival.html) promises to be a great weekend of music, storytelling and sailing.

Over forty years ago, the folk singer, [Pete Seeger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger), decided that he wanted to do something about the Hudson River, which was polluted with sewage, industrial waste and toxic chemicals and considered environmentally “dead.”  He decided to “build a boat to save the river.”  His idea was to build a replica of the classic Hudson river sloop to bring people down to the river again.  The Great Hudson River Revival initially helped raise the funds to build the sloop, optimistically named, *[Clearwater](http://www.clearwater.org/)*, which has since become a world-renowned floating classroom and a symbol of effective grassroots action. The [Hudson River Sloop *Clearwater*](http://www.clearwater.org/) is a non-profit organization that sails at the forefront of the nation’s environmental challenges. So far, over 500,000 children have experienced the Hudson River estuary aboard the sloop. The revenue raised by the Revival goes to support *Clearwater*’s numerous educational programs and its work toward environmental and social justice—as well as keeping the *Clearwater* sailing.

As perhaps should not be surprising for a festival started by a singer & songwriter, the music line up at the Great Hudson River Revival is impressive.

A partial list of performers includes Ani Difranco, Martin Sexton, Béla Fleck, Dawes Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Arlo Guthrie & The Guthrie Family, Josh Ritter & The Royal City Band, Punch Brothers Featuring Chris Thile, Joan Osborne & The Holmes Brothers, Loudon Wainwright III, Balkan Beat Box, Alejandro Escovedo, Donna The Buffalo, Deer Tick, Peter Yarrow, Holly Near, Joanne Shenandoah, The Klezmatics, Tinariwen, Tom Paxton, David Amram, Raul Midón, Tom Chapin, and the Tao Seeger Brass Band, and many more. [For a more complete list click here](http://www.clearwater.org/festival/performers.html).

[Sails on the *Clearwater* and the M*ystic Whaler* will be available](http://www.clearwater.org/festival/sails/index.html). There will also be a fleet of small boats, canoes, kayaks and tall ships to ride, sail and tour, as well as food and crafts.   It should make for an amazing weekend.
