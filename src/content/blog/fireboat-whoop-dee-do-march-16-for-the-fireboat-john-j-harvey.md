It is a fundraiser for the [historic fireboat *John J Harvey*](http://fireboat.org/)  on Monday, Mar. 16th, 6:00-9:00 at [Tribeca 360](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tribeca-three-sixty-manhattan), 10 Desbrosses Street, just south of Canal Street in Mahnhattan. It is described as “not your Granny’s gala! — An evening of foot-stomping music, spectacular views, cocktail hour, fabulous buffet dinner, and that special fireboat quirkiness… Bluegrass Music with an urban twist by the NYCitySlickers!” [Click here to learn more and buy tickets](https://interland3.donorperfect.net/weblink/weblink.aspx?name=E203357&id=2).

From [Fireboat.org](http://fireboat.org/): *John J. Harvey* was built in 1931 and named for FDNY pilot John J. Harvey who was killed aboard fireboat Thomas Willett while fighting a fire aboard the North German Lloyd Line’s SS Muenchen. At 130 feet and 268 gross tons, she is among the most powerful fireboats ever in service, capable of pumping up to 18,000 gallons of water a minute. Harvey assisted during such notable fires as the Cunard Line pier fire in 1932, the burning of the Normandie in 1942, and the ammunition ship El Estero during World War II. She served the FDNY until her retirement in 1994.

On September 11, 2001, *John J. Harvey* was reactivated as FDNY Marine 2. Alongside FDNY fireboats Firefighter and John D. McKean, she pumped water for 80 hours, until water mains were restored. The story of John J. Harvey is the subject of countless news articlesand a 2002 Maira Kalman book.
