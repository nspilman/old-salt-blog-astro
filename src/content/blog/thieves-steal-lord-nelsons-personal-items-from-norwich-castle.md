*The items stolen, which have been on display at the museum because of Lord Nelson’s numerous links with the area, include a £25,000 mourning ring and a £10,000 saucer.  The ring, believed to have been made between 1803 and 1806, is enamelled and bears the letters N and B. The box, dated 1805, the ring was kept in was also taken.* *The saucer was from an 1802 tea service which was part of the inventory at Lord Nelson’s home.*  
  
*They also got away with two bronze medals, one commemorating the Battle of the Nile on August 1, 1798, and the other marking Nelson’s death in 1805, which are now both worth around £400 each.*  *A gilt metal box containing four medallions commemorating the victories of various admirals, which is worth £1,000, was also stolen on February 25 at around 2pm.  The daylight raid came less than a week after thieves tried to swipe a rhino horn from the castle just five days earlier.*
