This seems appropriate for an overcast Sunday in late November – a lovely drone video from a few years ago of the restored steel-hulled three-masted bark *[Glenlee](https://www.thetallship.com/)* on the River Clyde.

Built name in 1896, the *Glenlee* sailed for 23 years carrying bulk cargoes around the globe. In 1922, she became a sail training ship in the Spanish Navy.  Since 1993, *Glenlee* has been a museum ship at the [Riverside Museum](https://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/venues/riverside-museum) on Pointhouse Quay, Glasgow, Scotland.
