![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/bounty1.jpg)[HMS *Bounty* open to public in Maine](http://www.wgme.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.me/29de829d-www.wgme.com.shtml)

*The* [*HMS Bounty*](http://www.tallshipbounty.org/) *tall ship is open to the public during its stop in Maine.   The three-masted, 120-foot ship is open for tours Saturday and Sunday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Maine Maritime Museum in Bath.  The vessel arrived at the museum on Thursday and was also open to the public on Friday.*

*

The ship is a full-scale reproduction of the British merchant ship that gained notoriety for a maritime mutiny more than 200 years ago. The mutiny was the basis of the 1962 movie “Mutiny on the Bounty” starring Marlon Brando.  The ship used in the movie was bought in 2001 by the HMS Bounty Organization, which is dedicated to keeping the ship sailing.

*

*From Bath, it will sail to Portsmouth, N.H., for a tall ship festival next weekend.*
