Last Wednesday, the 123-year-old [*Victory Chimes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Chimes_\(schooner\)) was towed past the Rockland Harbor breakwater, in all likelihood, ending her long and storied carrier as a commercial sailing vessel. This Saturday, she arrived at Pier 25 in Manhattan on the Hudson River, where she is expected to be converted into a floating restaurant.  

In May, the three-masted, gaff-rigged schooner was sold at auction to [Miles and Alex Pincus.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/dining/drinks/holywater-tribeca.html#:~:text=Alex%20and%20Miles%20Pincus%20refer,near%20or%20on%20the%20water.) The Pincus brothers currently operate the seasonal bars and restaurants [Grand Bank](https://crewny.com/grand-banks)s on the [Sherman Zwicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Zwicker), a 142′ long wooden auxiliary fishing schooner docked in Manhattan on the Hudson River, and the [Pilot](https://crewny.com/pilot), an oyster bar on the Brooklyn waterfront on the ex-[*Highlander Sea*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lenbo/7733970066), originally christened *Pilot*, a gaff-rigged topsail schooner built in 1924.

The 128′ long *Victory Chimes* is the last surviving Chesapeake ram schooner. She is a US National Historic Landmark and is represented on the Maine State Quarter, originally minted in 2003. 

The previous owner and captain of the Victory Chimes was [Sam Sikkema](https://knox.villagesoup.com/news/victory-chimes-sails-off-over-the-horizon/article_7a0673cc-687d-11ee-b85e-0bd262c3c2c8.html), who also owns the schooner *[Grace Bailey.](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2023/10/tragedy-on-the-schooner-grace-bailey-main-mast-breaks-killing-1-injuring-3/)* Last week, the *Grace Bailey*‘s mainmast broke, killing one passenger and injuring three others.
