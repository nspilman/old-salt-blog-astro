This is a time lapse of the construction of a cruise ship for the German [AIDA Cruises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDA_Cruises) at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) [Nagasaki Shipyard & Machinery Works](https://www.mhi-global.com/company/aboutmhi/organization/nagasakiw/index.html). Superficially, it is an entertaining short video in which an entire new ship emerges as if assembled from Lego blocks.

Watch a bit closer and you can get a sense of the extreme complexity of building a cruise ship. Cruise ships are among the most complicated of all ships to build. Each block is a fully fabricated sub-assembly, which must fit perfectly with the blocks on all sides. All the structure, machinery, wiring, piping, hydraulics and ventilation must line up to very fine tolerances. The design and engineering is exacting. For many years, the only shipyards which had the capacity to build cruise ships economically were European. Obviously, MHI is now fully capable of building cruise ships, as well.
