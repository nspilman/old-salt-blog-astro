Just reading in [Treehugger](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2011/03/no-longer-seaworthy-wrecked-boats-are-recycled-into-furniture.php) about Nic Kruger, a furniture designer, in Knysna, South Africa, who runs [Shipwreck Furniture](http://www.shipwreckfurniture.com/portfolio-of-furniture.html), which makes  tables, benches and shelves from timber recovered from shipwrecked boats.  Very interesting stuff.   Not sure that it goes with the decor in my house.  Then again, most of the time, my office looks a bit like a shipwreck, so who knows.    To check out their [portfolio of furniture click here](http://www.shipwreckfurniture.com/portfolio-of-furniture.html).
