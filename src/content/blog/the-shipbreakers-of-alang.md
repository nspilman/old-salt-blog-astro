Ships have a finite lifespan, usually not more than 20 years, often much less.  When a ship reaches the end of its economic life, there needs to be a place to recycle the steel, the other valuable metals and equipment.  In a perfect world this recycling would be done safely and cleanly. Unfortunately, this is far from a  perfect world.  [Alang beach in India’s Gujarat province is one of the world’s biggest shipbreakers](http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/alang-yard-dismantles-record-ships-in-2011-12/470546/), which the [Voice of America](http://www.voanews.com/content/reports-focus-on-indian-shipbreaking-147969395/180441.html) calls “an access-restricted, mafia-controlled funerary ground for hulking steel-container vessels marooned for demolition.”  The operations are both dirty and dangerous.  A 2004 documentary directed by Micheal Kot  on the shipbreakers of Alang, India is now available on-line.  Disturbing, but worth watching.
