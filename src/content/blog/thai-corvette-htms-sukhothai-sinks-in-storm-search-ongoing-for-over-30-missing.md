![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/thaicorvette.jpg)The Thai navy says 31 sailors are missing after the corvette, [*HTMS Sukhothai,*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTMS_Sukhothai) with a crew of 100 capsized and sank during a storm in the Gulf of Thailand. The ship sank around 23:30 local time Sunday (16:30 GMT) after being struck by large waves, which caused down-flooding, knocking out the ship’s power. 

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-64023249) reports that search crews worked through the night to find survivors, with the operation continuing on Monday with air force assistance.

The ship had been on a patrol 32km (20 miles) east of Bang Saphan, in the Prachuap Khiri Khan province, when it got caught in the storm on Sunday.

*HTMS Sukhothai* was one of two Ratanakosin class corvettes built for the Royal Thai Navy in the United States. The ship was commissioned in 1987.
