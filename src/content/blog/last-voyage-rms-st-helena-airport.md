![sthelenacrop](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/sthelenacrop.jpg)The [RMS *St Helena*, the last true Royal Mail Ship, recently departed from the UK](http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/update/2016-06-14/rms-st-helena-says-farewell-to-uk-for-last-time/) on its final voyage for its namesake island.  St. Helena, which lies around 1,150 miles off the coast of Angola in the South Atlantic, is the most remote populated island in the world. The Royal Mail Ships have been the primary means for people and cargo to travel to and from the isolated island for decades. [RMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_St_Helena_\(1989\)) *[St Helena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_St_Helena_\(1989\)),* which is twenty six years old and has suffered from chronic engine problems, is scheduled to be retired following her final voyage. Her passenger service is to be taken over by regular flights from Cape Town into a new airport built on the rocky volcanic island. Cargo that had been carried by the mail ship will now be [transshipped through Cape Town by feeder ship](http://awshipmanagement.com/2016/03/aw-ship-management-to-provide-marine-cargo-service-to-st-helena/).

The airport was supposed to begin operations in May, but there has been a problem. Planes may not be able to land. More specifically, wind shear on the northerly approach to the runway is described as “more severe than anticipated.”  It is now being reported that the airport opening has been postponed for “an indefinite period.”  [Air Transport World](http://atwonline.com/airports-routes/st-helena-airport-opening-delayed-wind-shear-problems) reports that St. Helena governor Lisa Phillips denied media reports that the £285 million ($415 million) airport was effectively unusable.

*“Wind shear is a factor at several airports around the world, including London City Airport, where safe landings happen every day,” she said. “In the meantime, we are working hard to identify an interim flight solution that can land on our second runway \[02, from the south\]. There is no wind shear … but there is a tailwind.”*

*She continued: “We have identified aircraft types which can land in these conditions, and airlines that have these planes—and we are now exploring the specific availability of aircraft with these airlines. The airport is certified and open, as demonstrated by the emergency medevac flight last Saturday when we were able to fly a sick baby to Cape Town.”*

*That flight involved a Dassault Falcon 20 executive jet, rather than an airliner.*

The natives of the island of St Helena are commonly called “Saints.”  The situation may require the patience of saints before it is all sorted out.  In the meantime, it might be nice to keep the old mail ship around just a while longer.
