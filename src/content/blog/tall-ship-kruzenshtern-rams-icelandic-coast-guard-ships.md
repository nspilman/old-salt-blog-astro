The Russian Sail Training Ship *[Kruzenshtern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruzenshtern_\(ship\))* was maneuvering to depart the old harbor in Reykjavík, Iceland, yesterday, when she rammed two of the largest [Icelandic Coast Guard vessels, *Týr* and *Thor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Coast_Guard). Both ships suffered damage, although well above the waterline. There are no reports on damage to the Kruzenshtern.

This is not the only time in the last year that the Russian tall ship has caused damage while attempting to leave a harbor. [Last August, we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/08/russian-barque-kruzenshtern-withdraws-from-race-after-sinking-tug/) about how the *Kruzenshtern* accidentally sank the tug, *Dive Master*, as it departed the port of Esbjerg on its way to start of the Falmouth Tall Ships Regatta. The Kruzenshtern withdrew from the regatta following the sinking. The tug crew was rescued without serious injury.

The *Kruzenshtern*, built as the *Padua* in 1926, is one of four surviving [Laeisz Flying P liners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner) and the last actively sailing. The 375′ long, 3,064 GRT, four masted barque is the second largest windjammer still in active service, just behind the Russian sail training ship *[Sedov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS_Sedov)*.

The other surviving Flying P liners are the *[Pommern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommern_\(ship\));* a museum ship in Mariehamn, Finland; the [*Peking*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_\(ship\)), a museum ship in New York City’s South Street Seaport and the [*Passat*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passat_\(ship\)), a museum ship in Lübeck’s sea resort of Travemünde, Germany.
