![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/barkeuropa.jpg)The 112-year-old steel-hulled [bark *Europa*](https://www.barkeuropa.com/) slipped on her side while [attempting to be placed back into the water from a drydock](https://www.barkeuropa.com/logbook/detail/update-from-the-ship) at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town, South Africa on Saturday morning. One crew member was injured, but is reported to be in stable condition and receiving appropriate medical care.

The extent of the damage to the ship is being assessed, and currently, no determination has been made as to the exact timeline for resuming sailing operations. The [accident comes less than a month](https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/pics-112-year-old-tall-ship-bark-europa-falls-on-its-side-at-waterfront-cape-town-20230520) before the vessel was scheduled to embark on a 53-day sail training voyage to the Portuguese island city of Horta in the Azores, on June 13th.

*Europa* is 39.8 m (131 ft) long and is registered in the Netherlands. She was originally built as a German lightship, [*Senator Brockes*](https://web.archive.org/web/20120804030503/http://www.feuerschiffseite.de/HAPPY/europa.htm), in 1911 at the H.C. Stülcken & Sohn shipyard in Hamburg, Germany. Until 1977, she served as a lightship on the river Elbe. In 1994, she was fully restored as a bark and retrofitted for special-purpose sail training.

*Europa* cruises worldwide and accepts paying voyage crew (trainees) for short or long trip segments, including ocean crossings, Sail Training Association races, and annual voyages to Antarctica, and between South Georgia, Tristan da Cunha, and Cape Town.
