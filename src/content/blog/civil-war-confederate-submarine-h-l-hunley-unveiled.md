![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hunley2.jpg)The [Confederate Navy submarine *H.L. Hunley*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Hunley_\(submarine\)) was unveiled yesterday for the first time since it was recovered  from the ocean floor near Charleston more than a decade ago.  The vessel, a 42 feet long iron cylinder,  is credited as the first “successful” submarine in that it [sank the](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_USS_Housatonic) *[USS Housatonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_USS_Housatonic)* on February 17, 1864 during the US Civil War*.*  It was not a particular success in any other regard, as the *Hunley* sank before reaching port, killing her crew of eight.   Prior to her first and only attack, the *Hunley* had sunk twice before, killing an additional 13 crew, including her inventor and namesake, Horace L. Hunley.  The wreckage of the Hunley was discovered in 1970 by  the archaeologist E. Lee Spence.  The wreck was raised on August 8, 2000 and transported to the Charleston Navy Yard where it has undergone over a decade of research and restoration.
