![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/fishdock.jpg)Oh well. I guess there is nothing surprising about this news report.  It seems that David Copp, a tourist visiting  Ilfracombe Harbour, west of Bristol, in the UK, complained to the harbor-master that the fish being landed on the quayside had a “disgusting smell.”  Nor, for that matter, were the fish pleasent to look at.  [As reported by the Telegraph, via Yahoo](http://uk.travel.yahoo.com/p-promo-3361576):

*The 46-year-old was outraged that his children, aged seven and nine, had been forced to endure the sight of 12 crates of dead fish and crabs, piled up on the quayside.*    

*“There were flies flying around and the smell was awful,” he said. “The ship was just sat there not doing anything, and there were 12 crates of dead crabs and fish just lying there covered in flies. It’s not the sort of thing you want to see on holiday, there was a real stench. My children were quite distressed by it. These people should be a bit more considerate to the holidaymakers.”*

*Mr Copp called Ilfracombe harbourmaster Rob Lawson to complain about the smell that had emanated from The Lady of Lundy trawler before calling the North Devon Journal to air his woes.*

We expect any minute that local authorities will be swamped with complaints that the waves on the beach are very wet, cold and rather salty.  And let’s not discuss the sand – far too gritty and damp.  Thanks to Chris Brady on the Maritime History List for pointing out the story.
