A huge group of an estimated 10,000 dolphins was sighted off the coast of San Diego last week. Captain Joe Dutra, of Hornblower Cruises, called the gathering of adult and juvenile common dolphins a “super mega-pod.” Dolphins typically travel in pods of 15 to 200 animals. Last month [an unusually large pod of 23 gray whales](http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2013/01/23/30190/rare-large-pod-of-23-gray-whales-spotted-off-socal/) was also seen migrating off the Southern California coast.
