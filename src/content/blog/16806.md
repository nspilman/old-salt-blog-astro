The US [Coast Guard Cutter Midgett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Midgett_\(WHEC-726\)) recently busted a midget sub loaded with cocaine while on a cruise of the Eastern Pacific.    The 35′ long self-propelled semi-submersible was carrying 6,000 kilograms of cocaine from Columbia bound for the United States.  This was only the second ever seizure of a self propelled semi-submersible by a U.S. Coast Guard cutter.  In addition to the catching the narco-sub, the Cutter Midget seized 11 tons of cocaine and marijuana on five trafficking vessels and detained 20 suspected narcotics traffickers.  The cutter also performed three search and rescue missions while on patrol.

The Cutter *Midgett* is named after Chief Warrant Officer John Allen “Bos’n” Midgett, Jr. was born in 1876 in Rodanthe, North Carolina, and served for nearly forty years with the United States Life-Saving Service and the Coast Guard.   USCGC *Midgett* is the twelfth and last of the United States Coast Guard’s fleet of 378 ft  high endurance cutters. With her crew of twenty four officers and one hundred sixty enlisted men and women, she is homeported in Seattle, Washington.
