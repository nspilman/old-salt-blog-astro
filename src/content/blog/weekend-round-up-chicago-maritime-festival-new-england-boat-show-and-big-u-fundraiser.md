Chicago's Tall Ship Windy is a festival sponsor

For a late winter weekend, this one is busy with maritime events.   The [Chicago Maritime Festival](http://www.chicagomaritimefestival.org/) this weekend sounds fantastic.  “*Daytime activities include maritime history, lighthouses, shipwrecks, model boats for kids, life raft demonstrations, marine art, songs for younger sailors, knot tying and more, presented by working mariners, authors, divers, educators, explorers, artists, and nautical notables from around the world. The evening concert features some of the finest maritime singers from both sides of the Atlantic.*”    Wow.  
  
Also starting this weekend and lasting for over a week is the [New England Boat Show](http://www.newenglandboatshow.com/) in Boston, MA.   Unlike the last New York Boat Show which was a disappointing assemblage of cookie cutter plastic power boats with no sailboats larger than dinghies, the New England Boat has something for all tastes across the boating spectrum.  In addition tot he boats they are also offering seminars, contests and give-a-ways.

Also on this Friday in New York, the SS United States Conservancy is sponsoring a [Cocktail Fundraiser for the SS United States](http://www.ssunitedstatesconservancy.org/news/_/2011/2/conservancy-fundraising-event-in-nyc-february-25/) at at O’Lunney’s Times Square Pub, 145 West 45th Street, in New York City from 6 PM to 9 PM.
