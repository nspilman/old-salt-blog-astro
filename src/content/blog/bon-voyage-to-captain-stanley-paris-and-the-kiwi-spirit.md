A few hours ago, [Stanley Paris](http://stanleyparis.com/), 76, at the helm of the 63′ custom yacht, [*Kiwi Spirit*](http://stanleyparis.com/?page_id=1120), sailed from the sea-buoy at St. Augustine, Florida, bound out on a solo, non-stop un-assisted voyage around the globe.  Paris will be attempting to beat American yachtsman [Dodge Morgan’s 1986 solo-circumnavigation record](http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org/solo/ddmorgan.htm) of 150 days. If he succeeds, he will also be the oldest person to circumnavigate. The voyage, which Paris has planned for the last 4 years, is intended to be completely green, using no hydrocarbons. The *Kiwi Spirit* does have an engine but will be used only in case of emergencies. We wish you fair winds, Dr. Paris.  [To track the Kiwi Spirit’s voyage, click here](http://my.yb.tl/kiwispirit).

As reported last year by [Ocean Navigator](http://www.oceannavigator.com/May-June-2012/Kiwi-Spirit-to-challenge-Dodge-Morgans-record/), Dr. Paris is no stranger to a challenge:  *In 1985 he completed the World Championship Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii, he twice swam the English Channel and has sailed across both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. He has also logged more than 60,000 sea miles since 1983 and already completed one circumnavigation, three North Atlantic crossings and two Alaska to New Zealand passages as owner/captain of a Nauticat 44, Nauticat 52, and Farr 60.*

Edit:  [Wojtek ‘Voytec’ Wacowski](https://www.facebook.com/voytec) points out on Facebook that if Paris beats Dodge record he will not be the first:

*My respect and admiration but for the record – 5 different French sailors have beaten the Dodge Morgan’s time already in various editions of Vendée Globe – latest from January 2013 is 78days 2h 16 and belongs to François Gabart on) MACIF Monohull During Vendée Globe 2012-2013, non-stop and no assistance.*
