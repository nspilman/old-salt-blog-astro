Last February, [we posted that the US Navy planned to deploy its first laser weapon](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/02/the-navys-newest-laser-weapons-on-uss-ponce-one-of-its-oldest-ships/) on one of its oldest ships. The new laser weapon has now been deployed on the 43 year old [*USS *Ponce**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Ponce_%28LPD-15%29), an Austin-class amphibious transport dock, for field testing in the Persian Gulf. The prototype [30-kilowatt-class Laser Weapon System](http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/dahlgren/NEWS/LAWS/img1.html) (LAWS) has been aboard since late August, according to officials.  The laser is designed to be able to destroy planes, drones and small boats at a range of ten miles.
