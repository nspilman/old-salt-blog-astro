![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/08/bayesian.jpg)Five days ago, the 56-meter-long sailing yacht [*Bayesian*](https://www.superyachts.com/fleet/bayesian-3639/) sank at anchor off Sicily in extreme weather. Fifteen people on board were rescued and seven died, including British tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter, Hannah.

This morning Italian prosecutors said that they have opened an investigation into culpable shipwreck and manslaughter over the deaths in the yacht’s sinking. They stressed, however, that the investigation was in its initial stages and they were not currently looking at anyone specifically.

Contrary to initial reports that suggested the vessel may have sunk because of a waterspout, the authorities now say the most likely cause was a localized, powerful wind known as a [downburst](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdk0nd9n4zo).

### Many Unanswered Questions Why and How *Bayesian* Sank

Many questions remain unanswered as to why and how the *Bayesian* sank.

The yacht’s builder blames crew error. Giovanni Costantino, CEO of [The Italian Sea Group](https://theitalianseagroup.com/perini-navi-tisg-presents-the-new-fleet/), told Reuters that a series of “indescribable, unreasonable errors” by the crew led to the shipwreck.  He also described the vessel as “[unsinkable](https://au.news.yahoo.com/bayesian-superyacht-maker-says-boats-115153612.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHdBrcio7wK4BgnBQApBrLfDKmEly1WJ8-4IsjOJlfHv5MvYyABylY_T2gNOumpfIQCFiI5uYfoTRzKANCqznkfC7f1tTKsxOsRgMs8NDRvfsdfZ0GN8bVfTWIjpnOtXnnUwCS7loBFJd0n7el7VRvrZuXLvOS4rZVKeLimgGWuw),” perhaps a poor word choice in discussing a vessel that recently sank.

For a more objective analysis, Peter Swanson recently posted on his newsletter, [Loose Cannons](https://loosecannon.substack.com/), [Yacht Design Experts Dissect How an ‘Act of God’ Sank Bayesian](https://loosecannon.substack.com/p/yacht-design-experts-dissect-how?r=nzq2r&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&fbclid=IwY2xjawE3FNVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHTHH0jMkWSAiivLjygSI8u-VNAgLc-tS1uy8gFiNO5IQmeuXwzaHlk8ARQ_aem_MNPo7VvvhZ_ixuZ7dvrppw&triedRedirect=true), featuring the perspectives of Chris Freer, Tad Roberts, and Roger Long.

[Chris Freer](https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1eyq5yz/chris_freer_on_bayesian_sinking/) observes “*This is a one in a million tragedy but we should examine the facts and learn from them. Bayesian boasts the second highest mast in the world at 75 metres on a length of 56 meters. She has a lifting keel to enable her to get into shallow areas. Fully down it gives a draft of 9.83 meters and raised a draft of 4 meters. A sailing yacht has a keel to counter the heeling moment generated by the power of her sail plan. I’m sorry to say that size matters to a superyacht owner and naval architects are seduced into providing solutions.*”

[Tad Roberts](https://www.tadroberts.ca/?fbclid=IwY2xjawE3O05leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHTuMCrzOgzOhv0pgEu8L4FQLXoACP6MGY_lCjKbGFGwOQr7gX-JLpYSPJA_aem_J2MdrAT8WVOU922WAV3AYA) comments “*We’ve learned a few things from the divers in Italy and some comments from current and former crew. Divers have reported the boat is “intact,” presumably that means the rig is all there and in one piece. She is lying on the bottom at a 90-degree heel angle. Which is why the mast is not sticking up out of the water.*

*“A crew member has reported that the weather deteriorated and they (the crew) were on deck securing everything moveable (cushions, doors, etc.), and the boat was heeling about 20 degrees to starboard in the strong wind. Suddenly the heeling increased and they were in the water. This sounds like sudden massive downflooding. The door in the topsides aft is on the port side.*

*“The boat has a longish stub keel which contains the majority of her ballast, that stub keel also contains the large pivoting centreboard which is also ballasted, one report claims the board weighs approximately 45 tons. The board was normally only deployed when sailing, as it apparently makes noise which might bother someone trying to sleep. So the board was retracted that night. The boat is divided into numerous watertight compartments, the flooding of any one of which would not sink the boat….*

“*The head of the Italian Sea Group, parent of the builder Perini, has stated Bayesian had positive stability to 73 degrees with the board up and 88 degrees with the board down.*

*[Roger Long](https://www.facebook.com/roger.long.18) replied, “Seventy-three degrees? There you go. The heeling arm would have again been above the righting arm at about 2/3 of that angle and, without sheets to ease or ability to steer, she would have been committed to capsizing around 50 degrees of heel.”* 

These views address the issue of the *Bayesian*‘s stability and the likelihood of downflooding. Nevertheless, exactly how the yacht flooded and sank so rapidly after being knocked down, remains unclear. A lot of attention is being paid to whether the stern door on the port side was open and whether the doors to the watertight compartments were properly secured. 

As is the case with most tragedies, I suspect that no single event will be determined to be the cause of the sinking. Rather it seems likely that a series of mistakes in the design and operation of *Bayesian* will ultimately prove to have been the source of the fatal casualty.  Time will tell.
