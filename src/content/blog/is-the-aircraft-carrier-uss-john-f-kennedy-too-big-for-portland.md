![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/jfkcarrier.jpg)We have previously [posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/02/08/maine-group-in-running-for-decommissioned-jfk/) about efforts to permanently moor the decommissioned aircraft carrier *[USS John F. Kennedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_John_F._Kennedy_\(CV-67\))* in Portland, Maine.   The Navy is is considering proposals from Portland and Rhode Island.  Many in Portland are not happy at the prospect of mooring the aircraft carrier in the harbor however.  ““It’s not a good fit,” said David Marshall, a City Council member. “It would block a good portion of our view corridors, and it ends up being a potential liability for the city.”  A recent [editorial in the  Maine Sunday Telegraph](http://www.pressherald.com/opinion/council-should-say-no-thanks-to-carrier_2010-09-16.html), sums up the problem succinctly, “*Everything about the project is too big except the level of public support behind it.*”  
  
The concerns range from the physical size of the ship blocking the view to the cost of dredging the harbor  to bring the ship in, to the overall financial viability of the project.  Richard Fitzgerald, head of a nonprofit group’s effort to bring the John F. Kennedy to Portland, says, “It would be the best thing that ever happened to the state of Maine.”   *USS John F. Kennedy* was the last American non-nuclear powered aircraft carrier to have been built.
