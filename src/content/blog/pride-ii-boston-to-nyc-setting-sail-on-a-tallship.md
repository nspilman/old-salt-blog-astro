A great video to start the week by [Gale Browning](https://vimeo.com/galebrowning) aboard the *[Pride of Baltimore II](http://www.pride2.org/)* .

*The Pride of Baltimore II is a replica of an 1812-era Baltimore Clipper topsail schooner built in 1988 in Baltimore harbor to be a Goodwill Ambassador for the state of Maryland. I signed on to be working guest crew on a passage from Boston to New York City in September 2013. The breeze was perfect for setting most of the sails including the top gallant, fore topsail and stun’sail. After motorsailing through the Cape Cod Canal, we sailed most of the way to New York City. Come aboard and meet some of the characters that sail on tallships.*
