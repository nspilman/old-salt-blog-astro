![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/04/cgscanada.jpg)In 2001, divers located the wreck of a ship off the Florida Keys in 220 feet of water.  She had the distinctive ram bow of an early 20th century war ship but lacked guns or other weaponry.   She has been identified as the *Queen of Nassau* which was originally the *HMCS Canada*, the first vessel of the fledgling Canadian Navy.  As Canada prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the Canadian navy next month, marine archeologists at the US’s NOAA are working to designate the wreck as a historic site due of its significance in the evolution of Canada’s military.
