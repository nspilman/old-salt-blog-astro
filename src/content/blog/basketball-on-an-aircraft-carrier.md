On Nov. 11, 2011, the [Veteran’s Day Carrier Classic](Veteran's Day Carrier Classic) basketball game between North Carolina and Michigan State will be played on an aircraft carrier in San Diego harbor. Either the [USS *Ronald Reagan*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Carl_Vinson_\(CVN-70\)) or the [USS *Carl Vinson*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Carl_Vinson_\(CVN-70\)) is expected to host the first ever collegiate basketball game on a warship. The [USS *Carl Vinson* was recently in the news as the ship from which Osama bin Laden was buried at sea](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/05/02/navy-seals-kill-bin-laden/).

The US Navy has twice as many aircraft carriers than the rest of the world combined.   Based on the acreage of the flight decks, the ratio jumps to five times.   [Nimitz class carriers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimitz_class_aircraft_carrier) like USS *Ronald Reagan* and the USS *Carl Vinson* each cost about $4.5 billion dollars to build.  As basketball courts go, that is very expensive.
