I will admit to having distinctly mixed feelings related to the rescue of the Kaufman family on their yacht *‘Rebel Heart.*‘ I am obviously pleased that Lyra received medical attention. I am saddened that the boat that was their home was lost. I am impressed by the skill, expertise and the resources marshaled by the California Air National Guard, the US Navy and the US Coast Guard. All these responses are fairly obvious and non-controversial. The larger question is harder to answer. KJ Dell’Antonia writes about it in the [Motherlode blog](http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/) in yesterday’s New York Times. The blog post is titled, “[Judge the ‘Rebel Heart’ Sailboat Parents, or Envy Them?](http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/parenting/2014/04/07/judge-the-rebel-heart-sailboat-parents-or-envy-them/)”  In some respects the answer may be, both.

Her post, which is worth reading in its entirety, ends:

*I’m far too anxious about everything from expanses of water to my retirement savings to ever make the kinds of choices that the Kaufmans have made, but when I read about their journey, and even about its ending, I envy them all the things that let them do it, from the courage to take physical risks and defy expectations it took to set out, to the skill, confidence and sheer willingness to work and endure that let them get as far as they did. Those are the parents Lyra and Cora have; those are qualities they themselves will gain. If blind optimism and a certain sense of hubris are also part of the package, well, there are worse faults, and maybe one of them is spending more time dreaming of adventure than experiencing it, particularly if it includes sheltering our children from experiencing any risk at all.*

*In spite of our bedtime reading, we are not a family who sails across oceans. I’m glad, though, that there are families like the Kaufmans out there; happy for their rescue, and hopeful that they’ll find a way back to sea when they choose. I can see my colleague’s point about the foolhardiness of the venture, but I appreciate those who venture boldly forth just the same.*

I fully understand those who object to going to sea with a one year old.  The problem is that I am not sure if there is any specifically “safe” age to set off across an ocean.  As a parent of two sons myself I am not sure if there is any safe age or even safe place. I am reminded that this summer in West New York, a bus driver distracted on a cell phone, clipped a light pole with his bus. [The pole fell, crushing a beautiful 8 month old baby girl in her stroller.](http://gothamist.com/2013/07/31/chain_reaction_crash_kills_baby_in.php)

It would be absurd to say that the child should have been out to sea in a sailboat where there are no distracted bus drivers talking on cell phones.  It would equally wrong to say that children should not be taken offshore because it is too unsafe.  There are risks everywhere. Just taking a child in an automobile is a very real risk. National [Highway Safety Administration data](http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/809762.pdf) shows that on average 6 children die every day in the United States in car accidents and close to 700 are injured.

[Diane Selkirk writing in Slate.com addresses the risks and rewards.](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/family/2014/04/rebel_heart_sailboat_rescue_eric_and_charlotte_kaufman_are_part_of_my_community.html) 

*Adventure sailing with young children can be risky. It’s also the best way I know how to parent.*

*My husband and I sailed for three-and-a-half years, over 12,000 miles, and through 10 countries before pulling into a foreign port and having a kid. We kept our adventures land-based for a while, not setting off on our daughter Maia’s first extended cruise until she was 3. At 12 years of age, Maia’s now put in more sea hours than shopping hours and is more familiar with the stars in the sky (in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres) than the ones in the tabloids. She’s graceful and self-assured, in no small part because of her unconventional childhood.*

The issue of the rescue itself is not just about about the child becoming ill.  Anyone of the four people aboard the *‘Rebel Heart*‘  could have become sick or been injured.  Two years ago we posted about [Derk Wolmuth who was sailing his sailboat, *Bela Bartok*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/11/single-handing-minus-one-the-strange-voyage-of-the-bela-bartok/), in a Singlehanded TransPac race between San Francisco and Kaua’i, Hawaii when he suffered a life-threatening bout of septic shock.  Because he was not far from shipping lanes, he was picked up by a passing ship bound for California.

A related question is the cost of the rescue. Should taxpayers pay for the cost?  Oddly, in many cases, including that of  [Derk Wolmuth and the *Bela Bartok*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/11/single-handing-minus-one-the-strange-voyage-of-the-bela-bartok/) mentioned above the cost of the rescue was primarily the cost of diverting a passing ship to pick him up, which was picked up by the ship’s owner. The [AMVER](http://www.amver.com/) (Automated Mutual-Assistance Vessel Rescue) system operated by the US Coast Guard does a great job routing ships to assist sailors in distress, and has been doing so for more than fifty years.  In cases like Wolmuth’s, the taxpayers pay very little.

Unfortunately, *Rebel Heart* was in an area of the Pacific well outside of most sea lanes, so, apparently, routing a ship to the yacht was not a practical option.  Calling on the California Air National Guard pararescuers and the US Navy *[USS Vandegrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Vandegrift_\(FFG-48\))* was the fastest way to get aid to the family.  Using a 453 foot long guided missile frigate to rescue a 36′ sailboat may seem like overkill, but the speed of the frigate meant that they could get help to the sick infant faster than any other means.

And yes, the taxpayers will pay for the rescue.  Nevertheless, taxpayers have already paid close to $200 million for the construction and upkeep of the frigate. Taxpayers spent over $10 billion dollars for the 50 other frigates of this class, as well.  These frigates are among the lower cost vessels in today’s Navy. If the *[USS Vandegrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Vandegrift_\(FFG-48\))*  was available for the rescue, as a taxpayer, I am pleased to see her used in this humanitarian mission. Given the trillions of dollars the US government has spent in recent years, one needless war comes immediately to mind, the cost of the fuel to rescue this family doesn’t seem all that high.  Perhaps we should think of it as training mission.
