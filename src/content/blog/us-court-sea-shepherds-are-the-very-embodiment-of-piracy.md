![sea-shepherd](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/02/sea-shepherd.jpg)Late Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the anti-whaling extremists and reality TV show stars, the [Sea Shepherds](http://www.seashepherd.org/), are indeed pirates.  In his ruling, Judge Alex Kozinski wrote: ” *When you ram ships, hurl glass containers of acid, drag metal-reinforced ropes in the water to damage propellers and rudders, launch smoke bombs and flares with hooks; and point high-powered lasers at other ships, you are, without a doubt, a pirate…  The activities that Cetacean \[the Japanese whalers\] alleges Sea Shepherd has engaged in are clear instances of violent acts for private ends, the very embodiment of piracy.”*

The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruling allows the Japanese whalers to continue their lawsuit the anti-whaling extremists.  In December, the court issued an injunction against the Sea Shepherds interfering with Japanese whaling activities, which the Sea Shepherds have ignored.  The Sea Shepherds are the stars of Animal Planet’s reality TV show, “[Whale Wars.](http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/whale-wars)”  Sea Shepherd founder and frequent  star of the TV show, Paul Watson is currently an international fugitive, after jumping bail in Germany on charges related to an attack on shark fishermen in Costa Rica in 2002. Interpol has issued a warrant for his arrest.

For the record, we oppose Japanese whaling but do not condone the Sea Shepherd’s vigilante violence, which does absolutely nothing to protect endangered species of whales, and which, has only hurt efforts to end Japanese whaling.  See our previous post – [Sea Shepherds Hurt Efforts to Reduce Whaling – WikiLeaks](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/sea-shepherds-hurt-efforts-to-reduce-whaling-wikileaks/)
