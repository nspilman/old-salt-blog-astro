Congratulations to Matt Rutherford who was recently awarded the [Ocean Cruising Club’s Jester Medal](http://www.oceancruisingclub.org/images/HomePage/Matt_Rutherford.pdf), for an outstanding contribution to the art of single-handed sailing. [In April of last year, Matt completed a record breaking 309 day, more than 27,000 mile, non-stop circumnavigation of the Americas](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/congratulations-to-matt-rutherford-on-his-309-day-solo-circumnavigation-of-the-americas/). He made this incredible voyage, which included singlehanded non-stop passages through the Northwest Passage and around Cape Horn, in *St. Brendan*, a 27’ Albin-Vega sailboat. In addition to completing the voyage itself Matt has raised over $100,000 for the Chesapeake Regional Accessible Boating (CRAB.) A documentary is in production about Matt’s voyage – [Red Dot on the Ocean](http://www.reddotontheocean.com/).
