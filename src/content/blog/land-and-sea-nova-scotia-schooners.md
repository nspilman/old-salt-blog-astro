In the United States, we have seen an explosion of so-called “reality TV,” which is usually more akin to unscripted soap opera than reality, fortunately.   In Canada, however, the CBC has some wonderful programming which is reality television in the very best sense.  On fine example is “[Land and Sea](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/),”  a program which for thirty years has been focussed on  stories from people who live off the land and the sea on the Canadian Atlantic.  Today, at noon, it will feature, “[Schooners](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/2011/12/schooners.html),” a look at the schooners of Nova Scotia.   For those of us who not live in Canada, the program will be available on-line [here](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/2011/12/schooners.html).    Here also are [comments from the director of the documentary.](http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/38959-director%E2%80%99s-cut-schooners)
