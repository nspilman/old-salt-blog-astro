![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/earl-swath-090210-453X258.jpg)Two major maritime festivals on the US East coast, scheduled for the Labor Day weekend, appear to be generally in the path of Hurricane Earl.    The organizers of the  [Twenty-Sixth Annual Gloucester Schooner Festival and schooner race](http://www.capeannvacations.com/schooner/) and the [Camden Windjammer Festival](http://www.camdenwindjammerfestival.com/), both of which are scheduled for September 3 -6, will be watching the Earl’s path closely.  So far the Downtown Gloucester Block Party has been cancelled and a note on the website reads:  *If weather conditions require changes be made to this weekend’s festivities, information will be posted on this website.*

The folks in Camden are keeping an eye to weather as well. The [Bangor Daily News reports](http://www.bangordailynews.com/story/Statewide/Mainers-keeping-an-eye-on-Earl,152682):  
  
*For now, events and programs remain in place as scheduled for the annual Blue Hill Fair and the Camden Windjammer Festival. A Pirate Invasion of Lubec set for Saturday morning might be postponed if the weather turns severe, but the Eastport Salmon Festival would still happen with “all food and music events” moved inside the Eastport Arts Center.*
