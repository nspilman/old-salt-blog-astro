Many years ago, I had the good fortune to sail with a volunteer crew of Patrick O’Brian aficionados from New York to Bermuda on the replica frigate [HMS *Rose*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Rose_\(1757\)). Despite being rather short on wind, it was a memorable voyage. The ship went on to play the HMS *Surprise* in the 2003 movie, [*Master and Commander: Far Side of the World*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_and_Commander:_The_Far_Side_of_the_World). She also appeared in *Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides*. Following the movies, the ship was donated to the [Maritime Museum of San Diego](https://sdmaritime.org/), where she kept the name — [HMS *Surprise*.](https://sdmaritime.org/visit/the-ships/hms-surprise/)

In 2020, *Rose/Surprise* will be a half-century old and in need of a refit. The museum’s goal will be to replank the entire starboard side of the ship’s hull and to restore her weather decks. Here is a short video about the restoration project.
