![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/06/aegean.jpg)In the early morning hours of April 28th, [the yacht Aegean disappeared](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/05/02/update-newport-to-ensenada-racing-tragedy-did-the-aegean-hit-the-rocks/) and sank in the Newport to Ensenada Race.  Wreckage of the  sailboat and the bodies of the fours sailors who had been aboard were subsequently found nearby. After initial speculation that there had been an explosion or that [the sailboat had been run down by a commercial vessel](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/29/3-dead-1-missing-in-suspected-collision-between-yacht-aegean-and-larger-vessel/), the log of an online tracking GPS tracking system suggested that the 37-foot Hunter 376 sailboat had struck the rocks on North Coronado Island. Yesterday, [US Sailing’s Independent Review Panel](http://media.ussailing.org/Latest_News/2012/USS_Newport_061212.htm) concluded that  a grounding on North Coronado Island was the cause of the accident.  A full report from US Sailing is expected by July.

Not everyone is satisfied with the panel’s conclusion. As reported by the [Daily Breeze.com](http://www.dailybreeze.com/rss/ci_20839494): *Anna Mavromati, daughter of the yacht’s captain, Theo Mavromatis, said her family believes the findings are premature and not accurate.   “It came as a shock,” said Mavromati, 24, who learned of US Sailing’s announcement in news reports. “I don’t think they have sufficient evidence to make the claims they are making.”*
