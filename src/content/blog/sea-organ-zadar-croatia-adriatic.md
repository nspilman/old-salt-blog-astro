![seaorgan](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/seaorgan.jpg)In [Zadar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadar), the oldest city in Croatia on the Dalmatian Coast of the Adriatic, there is an [sea organ which plays the timeless music of the waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_organ).  The sea itself is the composer and performer of the music. Waves force air through 35 harmonically tuned tubes built into a promenade of marble steps, creating random and yet hauntingly musical tones. The sea organ was created by architect [Nikola Basic](https://www.google.com/#q=architect+Nikola+Basic) in 2005, who received the European Prize for Urban Public Space for this project.
