![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Houston_Barge_Accid.jpg)One of the largest port complexes in the US has been shut down since Sunday morning after a barge accident almost knocked a high voltage tower into the Houston Ship Channel.    Over thirty ships have been blocked by the shut down of the ship channel.  An economic loss of almost $1 billion is estimated to result from the shutdown.   The ship channel is not expected to open until at least Tuesday night.
