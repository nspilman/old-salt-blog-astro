![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jonsanders2019.jpg)After completing his [10th circumnavigation of the globe](https://www.sail-world.com/news/200504/Jon-Sanders-completes-record-10th-circumnavigation) under sail in December of 2017 at the age of 77, legendary West Australian sailor [Jon Sanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Sanders) said that he was done. He said that the 10th trip around would be his last. 

A year and a half later, he is telling the [West Australian](https://thewest.com.au/sport/sailing/jon-sanders-to-circumnavigate-the-globe-in-his-yacht-for-the-11th-time-ng-b881231020z) a different story. At 79, he is getting ready for his 11th circumnavigation on his 34-foot *Perie Banou II*. 

“I told a lie, but I didn’t know I was going to tell a lie. I’m back here, I’m bored, I know I can do it, I know how to do it, I’ve got nothing else to do. What’ll I do, stay home? Just because I said it?”

As we [wrote after his 9th circumnavigation](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/02/jon-sanders-sails-home-to-perth-after-ninth-circumnavigation/) in 2015, Sanders is best known for his incredible voyage in 1986 – 1988 in which he circumnavigated the world three times singlehanded, non-stop without re-provisioning.  That voyage alone set something like 25 world records and no one has duplicated the voyage since. Previously, Sanders was also the first man to circumnavigate Antarctica, circling the continent twice in 1981 – 1982.
