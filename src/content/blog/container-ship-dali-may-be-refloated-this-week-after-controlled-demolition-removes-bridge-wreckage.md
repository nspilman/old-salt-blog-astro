![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/keybridgedali.jpg)The trapped container ship *Dali* will “hopefully” be refloated this week after authorities set off charges at a [key portion of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2024/03/baltimore-key-bridge-collapses-after-being-struck-by-container-ship-mv-dali/) on Monday evening, an official said.

The charges helped demolish a portion of the bridge wreckage resting on the ship – a move meant to help free the vessel, nearly seven weeks after it struck the bridge and caused the span to collapse. During the planned detonation, a chunk of the collapsed structure appeared to fall away from the ship and into the water, though a portion of wreckage remained on top of the ship, video showed.

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/13/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-demolition-monday) reports that officials are “very pleased” with the demolition but will be conducting surveys with divers to make sure nothing fell and damaged the hull of the container ship, US Army Corps of Engineers Col. Estee Pinchasin told reporters. Additionally, before the ship can be refloated, officials must verify that all the charges went off, Pinchasin said.

A “tremendous amount of steel” was removed from the Dali, Pinchasin said. Authorities would now examine how the remaining debris sat on the bow of the ship, the colonel said. While teams are prepared to move the remaining wreckage, Pinchasin doesn’t believe more explosives will be used, she said.
