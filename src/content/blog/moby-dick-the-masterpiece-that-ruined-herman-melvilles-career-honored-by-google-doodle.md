Today the Google Doodle honors [Herman Melville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville_bibliography)‘s masterpiece, [*Moby Dick*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick), on this the 161st anniversary of its publication.  Ironically, the book that has garnered Melville immortality also effectively ruined his career.   Known as a writer of semi-autobiographical stories, neither the critics nor the reader knew what to make of *Moby Dick*. Moby Dick and all of Melville’s other books as well would be out of print for thirty years by the time of his death in 1891.  *Moby Dick* would not become broadly popular until the “Melville Revival” of the 1920s.
