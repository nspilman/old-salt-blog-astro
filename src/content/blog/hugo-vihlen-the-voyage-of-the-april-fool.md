Hugo Vihlen sailing April Fool

On April 1, often referred to as April Fool’s Day, it seems fitting to recount the voyage of Hugo Vihlen in his micro-yacht [*April Fool*](http://iscc.marinersmuseum.org/watercraft/april-fool/). In 1966, [Hugo Vihlen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Vihlen) sailed from Casablanca to Florida, aboard his 5’11” sailboat. In 84 days he sailed 4,100 miles and got within 6 miles of Miami, Florida before being stopped by contrary winds and current. He was finally picked up by the US Coast Guard.

The micro-yacht *[April Fool](http://iscc.marinersmuseum.org/watercraft/april-fool/)* now resides at the I[nternational Small Craft Center](http://iscc.marinersmuseum.org/) at [The Mariners’ Museum](http://www.marinersmuseum.org/) in Newport News, VA.  Their web page features excerpts from Vihlen’s book, “[*April Fool or, How I sailed from Casablanca to Florida in a Six-Foot Boat*](http://www.amazon.com/April-Fool-Casablanca-Florida-six-foot/dp/B0006C0NIQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427897030&sr=1-3&keywords=hugo+vihlen).”  My favorite is from June 9, 1968 after 71 days at sea:

“*Catastrophe. I ran out of toilet paper today. Thank God for Reader’s Digest*.”

This log entry may point out an unexpecting shortcoming of ebooks on longer voyages.
