![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/silent55.jpg)Imagine a yacht that is almost completely silent, with a close to unlimited range, and that doesn’t pollute. While it may sound too good to be true, this is what [Silent Yachts](https://www.silent-yachts.com/) is aiming for in its line of electrically-powered luxury catamarans. The company offers catamarans ranging from 44 to 80 feet long and recently upgraded and improved its [*Silent 55*](https://www.silent-yachts.com/silent55/) design. One of the new designs has been delivered and three more are on order.

The new *Silent 55* is 54’8″ feet long by 27’7″ wide, providing lots of available deck space for solar panels and good storage below decks for lithium batteries. The company offers four configurations to suit the desires of potential owners. The “Cruiser” option is driven by two 30 KW (around 40 HP) electric motors and promises to be “noiseless cruising without any emissions, with unlimited range.” (There is also a diesel generator tucked away to charge the batteries if need be.)

The company also has a higher-powered/higher-speed version, as well as hybrid, capable of over 20 knots. At the other extreme, it also offers an electric-motorsailor version with a mast and sail.

The basic *Silent 55* coasts around $1.6 million, which Silent Yachts suggests is roughly comparable with the cost of a diesel-powered catamaran of the same size.

Whether or not an electric catamaran suits your tastes or checkbook, the potential for electrically powered motor vessels is enormous. As battery technology continues to improve and prices continue to fall there may be a shift away from diesel smoke to greener, if somewhat slower vessels. We recently [posted about a new all-electric, 60-meter long, Danish car and passenger ferry.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/08/green-energy-in-denmark-world-largest-electric-ferry-new-offshore-wind-farm/)
