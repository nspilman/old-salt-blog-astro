When the *Queen Mary* was delivered, a decade ago she was the largest cruise ship in the world. While she no longer holds that title, Cunard brags that she is still the world’s largest passenger liner.  The distinction is significant, whether or not her current operation really qualifies as “liner” service.  Passenger liners were ships that ran in regular scheduled service, carrying passengers. In the days before airplanes stole the passenger business, the great ocean liners were the best way to cross an ocean.  Cruise ships are more like floating resorts, usually designed to operate in warm and calm waters.

Because the Queen Mary 2 was designed to be able to operate in the winter North Atlantic, she was built considerably heavier than most modern cruise ships.  She is also considerably faster with a top speed of over 30 knots and a service speed of 26 knots. In additional to diesel engines to drive her electric generators, she has twin gas turbines for additional power to maintain schedules.
