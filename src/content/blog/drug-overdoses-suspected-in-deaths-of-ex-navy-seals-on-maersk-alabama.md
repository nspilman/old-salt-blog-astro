[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/20/world/asia/seychelles-maersk-deaths/)  is reporting that hypodermic needles and traces of narcotics were found with the bodies of two American security officers on the container ship *Maersk Alabama*, suggesting that the deaths resulted from drug overdoses, according to a Seychelles government official. Police said an autopsy would be carried out later this week.

*Seychelles police identified the bodies found Tuesday as Jeffrey Reynolds and Mark Kennedy, both 44. They worked for Trident Group, a Virginia-based maritime security services firm, and Trident Group President Tom Rothrauff said both were former Navy SEALs.*

*The 500-foot Maersk Alabama was the target of an attempted hijacking in the pirate-infested waters off east Africa in 2009 — an incident that inspired the 2013 film “Captain Phillips.” The shipping giant Maersk, which hired the Trident Group to guard its ships, said Thursday that Trident would be conducting random drug tests of its employees.*

*“Based on our experience with the contractor, this is an isolated incident,” Maersk said. But it said new drug tests would start immediately and the company’s shore-leave policy was under review. The Maersk Alabama has since left the Seychelles capital of Port Victoria, the company said Thursday.*
