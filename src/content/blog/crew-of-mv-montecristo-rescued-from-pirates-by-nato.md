The Italian owned bulk carrier, [MV *Montecristo*](http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Montecristo-9491379.html), was hijacked by pirates off Somalia on Monday.  The ship’s crew retreated to a protective citadel “safe room” ahead of the pirates.  Today [RFA *Fort Victoria*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA_Fort_Victoria_\(A387\)) and [USS *De Wert*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_De_Wert_\(FFG-45\)), acting as part of NATO’s counter piracy operation stormed the ship and rescued the crew, which was unharmed. A British Ministry of Defense spokesman said, “10-15 Royal Marines were involved. The pirates are now in NATO custody. No special forces were involved.”   Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for passing the story along.
