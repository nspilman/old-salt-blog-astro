Pan American Victory

The last four [Victory ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_ship) owned by the government are on their way toward the scrapyard.    The [Maritime Blog](http://themaritimeblog.com/1954/victory-ship-in-the-panama-canal-photos) recently post somegreat photos of the *Pan American Victory*, as she transited the Panama Canal not too long ago. She was on her final voyage from San Francisco, CA to Brownsville, TX for scrapping. The *Pan American Victory* was the first of the last 4 remaining Victory Ships still owned by the U.S. Government to depart the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet. She was shortly followed by the *Earlham Victory*, *Rider Victory*, and the *Winthrop Victory*.

Toward the end of World War II, 535 Victory ships were built in the United States.    Three Victories are still preserved as museum ships – the *[SS American Victory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_American_Victory)* in Tampa, FL;  the *[SS Lane Victory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Lane_Victory) in Los Angelos  and the [SS Red Oak Victory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Red_Oak_Victory_\(AK-235\)) in Richmond, California.*
