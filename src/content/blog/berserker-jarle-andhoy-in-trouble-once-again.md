Jarle Andhøy

Norwegian Jarle Andhøy, 34, who calls himself a [“Wild Viking](http://www.wildvikings.com/),” is in trouble again. Andhøy and two others are sailing the 54-foot yacht, *Nilaya,* off Antarctica. They have reported that the yacht has a broken boom and that they are heading for an unspecified  Argentine Antarctic base to carry out emergency repairs and to refuel.  Andhøy sailed to Antarctica without permits and is currently wanted by New Zealand authorities.  Andhøy is also reported to be sailing without an EPRIB.  
  
Last year on an “expedition” to Antarctica, [Jarle Andhøy’s yacht *Berserk* sank](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/25/off-antarctica-hope-fades-for-crew-of-yacht-berserk-ii/) with the loss of three crew members.  Andhøy and a companion had left the yacht in an ill-planned attempt to reach the South Pole.  Andhøy was travelling without permits or insurance, for which he was subsequently fined by the Norwegian Polar Institute 25,000 NOK.

As we posted in late January, [Andhøy mounted another illegal expedition](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/28/jarle-andhoy/) to Antarctica this year on the *Nilaya*, claiming that he was investigating what happened to the *Berserk* when it sank last year.  After searching for several weeks and finding nothing, Andhøy was reported to be sailing for South America.  Norwegian Samuel Massie, 19, and New Zealander Busby Noble, 53, are reported to be sailing with Andhøy.

Andhøy is best known for controversial voyages in polar regions usually without permits, or insurance, which have run afoul of the authorities in Norway, Finland, Russia and New Zealand.  He was deported from Canada in 2007.
