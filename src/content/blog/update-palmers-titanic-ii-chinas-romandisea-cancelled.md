![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/02/TitanicII.jpg)For a decade, we have followed the various announcements by Australian billionaire Clive Palmer regarding his [Titanic II project](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/02/titanic-ii-not-quite-exact-replica-sail-2018/). In 2012, Palmer announced the construction of a modern “replica”  of the doomed passenger liner RMS *Titanic* which sank after striking an iceberg in 1912.

Palmer’s *Titanic II* was to be built in a Chinese shipyard and go into service in 2016. Since then the project has moved in fits and starts. The project finances fell apart for several years. The [ship delivery dates moved first to 2018 and then to 2022](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/01/will-the-titanic-ii-ever-sail/). Despite an abundance of announcements, CGI drawings, and videos, apparently, no steel has actually been cut and no new delivery date has been announced.

Recently, Bright Sun Films posted a Youtube video, [Cancelled – Titanic 2](https://youtu.be/cJvexrKjBII), that looks at the history of various projects to build a “replica” of the ill-fated ship. And while there is no definitive word that Palmer’s *Titanic II* has been “canceled,” the prospects for it moving forward look exceptionally dim.

The film also looks at the [landlocked construction of a full-sized *Titanic* replica](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/08/full-sized-titanic-replica-under-construction-at-theme-park-in-china/) being fabricated in Suining, Sichuan province, China, 745 miles from the sea. The replica ship is intended as the centerpiece of a new resort development called [Romandisea](https://www.facebook.com/RomandiseaTitanic/), along the Qijiang River. The project has ground to a pandemic halt with the ship only partially completed. 

Things have not gone well, even for existing *Titanic* attractions. Last August, a wall of ice, representing an iceberg, collapsed at the [Titanic Museum Attraction](https://titanicpigeonforge.com/) in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, injuring three guests.
