![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/08/ldekker.jpg)One year ago, [Laura Dekker](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=dekker), now 15, set sail on her attempt to sail around the world alone. If she continues at her current pace, she will be the youngest person to ever complete a solo circumnavigation. Perhaps the most interesting thing about her voyage is that setting records doesn’t seem to be the primary goal.  
  
In May of last year [Jessica Watson, 17, became the youngest person ever to circumnavigate](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/22/laura-dekker-sets-sail-from-somewhere/) non-stop after completing an 8 month marathon sail.  [Abby Sunderland](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/02/02/abby-sunderland-restarts-her-round-the-world-attempt/) attempted to replicate Watson’s accomplishment. In order to finish the sail, however, while still younger than Watson and thereby be able to claim the title of “youngest,”  Sunderland had to sail late in the season and was [dismasted in an Indian Ocean storm](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/12/abby-sunderland-rescued-by-french-fishing-vessel-ile-de-la-reunion/).

Laura Dekker’s voyage began with an extended court battle over whether or not the then 14 year old should be allowed to sail alone.  Her actual sail, by contrast, has been relatively drama free. [Last August, she sailed from Gibraltar](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/22/laura-dekker-sets-sail-from-somewhere/) to the Canary Islands, where she prudently waited out the hurricane season before crossing the Atlantic to the Caribbean.  Rather than rounding Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, she  transited  the Panama Canal.   After a leisurely sail across the Pacific she is now in the Coral Sea, bound for Darwin, Australia. To reach Darwin she must navigate the infamous reef-strewn Torres Strait between Papua New Guinea and Cape York Peninsula in northeast Australia. The last major passage of her trip will be across the Indian Ocean.

If Dekker completes her voyage and becomes the youngest to sail around the world alone, Jessica Watson will still hold the title of the “youngest non-stop circumnavigator.”  Nevertheless,  Laura Dekker’s voyage has never appeared to be about titles and records, in any case.
