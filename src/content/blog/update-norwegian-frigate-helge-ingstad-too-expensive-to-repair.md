![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nfrigategrounded.jpg)Last November, the Norwegian navy frigate, [KNM *Helge Ingstad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNoMS_Helge_Ingstad_\(F313\)), was returning from NATO exercises when it mistook the Maltese flag, Aframax tanker, [*Sola TS*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/248020000), for an object onshore in the Hjeltefjord near Bergen, Norway. The [subsequent collision did minor damage to the tanker but sank the frigate.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/11/tanker-collides-with-norwegian-frigate-frigate-loses/)  It now appears that [frigate will be too expensive to repair](https://navaltoday.com/2019/06/24/sunken-norwegian-frigate-will-not-be-repaired-govt-says/) and may be scrapped.

[A report issued by the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency (NDMA)](https://navaltoday.com/2019/05/16/repairs-of-sunken-norwegian-frigate-would-cost-well-over-1b-inquiry-finds/) says that it would cost up to USD 1.65 billion to repair the frigate which spent four months almost completely submerged. The actual cost of the repairs are uncertain and could exceed estimates. By comparison, building a new, similar vessel would require an investment of around USD 1.53 billion. 

The Helge Ingstad was one of five [Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fridtjof_Nansen-class_frigate) that are the main surface combatant units of the Royal Norwegian Navy.
