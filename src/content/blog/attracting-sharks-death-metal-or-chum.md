Recently a documentary crew for the Discovery Channel experimented with blasting death metal music underwater to attract sharks. They succeeded. Apparently, the low frequencies common in death metal music sound something like fish in distress to sharks, who come looking for dinner.  

The [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/death-metal-music-attracts-sharks-documentary-crew-finds-out-10381295.html?fbclid=IwAR3cHijHAsxWSaLXhBby3jb8E7fDIU0WvRn0vmjB-vJVn08rnMtuauQ-Y3g) reports that the tactic is well-known by shark hunters. Matt Walller, a shark tour operator in Australia, found out that AC/DC records caused sharks to change their behaviour. When he played the tunes from underwater speakers, the sharks swam straight up to his boat, brushing their heads against the submerged diving cage. Other than being a boon for metal fans on shark tours, using music, instead of bait, could be more environmentally friendly. (For the AC/DC is not a death metal band.) 

The common way to attract sharks is to chum the water, using bait consisting of fish parts, bone, and blood. This increases the risk to divers and swimmers. Recently, Pine Knoll Shores, a town on the coast of North Carolina, is currently debating whether to ban the practice, due to eight people already being bitten by sharks in the area this summer.
