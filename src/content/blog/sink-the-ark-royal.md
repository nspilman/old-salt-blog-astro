![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/09/HMS-Ark-Royal.jpg)There have been a book, two movies and one pop song entitled, “[Sink the Bismark](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&x=13&ref_=nb_sb_noss&y=17&field-keywords=sink%20the%20bismark&url=search-alias%3Daps#?_encoding=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957).”    That is what came to mind when I heard that the Torbay Council’s Harbour Committee is recommending that they sink the [Ark Royal](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/15/farewell-to-hms-ark-royal/).   The aircraft carrier, the [ex-flagship of the Royal Navy, has been for sale since April.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/04/02/ark-royal-for-sale-online/)  Rather than have her sold to a scrap yard, the Torbay council is recommending that the ship be sunk as an artificial reef and recreational dive site.  [Wreck the World](http://inhabitat.com/former-royal-navy-aircraft-carrier-will-be-turned-into-an-artificial-diving-reef/), a group behind the proposal, believes that they are  in competition with up to twenty other bidders.
