Andy Hall at the [Maritime Texas](http://maritimetexas.net/wordpress/) blog has some excellent [before and after photos of the Port-au-Prince docks](http://maritimetexas.net/wordpress/?p=2320). Not only have the shore cranes fallen into the water but significant sections of the docks have also collapsed.

[Lloyd’s List reports:](http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/news/haiti-dockers-killed-in-earthquake/20017738281.htm;.5fa4e8cc80be35e2653c9f87d8b8be45bf6ba69a)

*Some 30 Haitian dockers working vessels at the moment when Tuesday’s earthquake struck were killed, mostly through drowning, according to the main operating company at the port of Port-au-Prince.*

*Richard Lebrun of Terminal Varreux also told the New York Times newspaper that its two terminals had been destroyed as a result of the disaster. In addition, the main commercial pier, wharf and the crane that removes shipping containers are under water.*
