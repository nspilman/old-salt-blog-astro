A BBC camera crew has videoed a “brinicle,” a bizarre underwater “icicle of death” in Antarctica.

*With timelapse cameras, specialists recorded salt water being excluded from the sea ice and sinking.*  *The temperature of this sinking brine, which was well below 0C, caused the water to freeze in an icy sheath around it.*  *Where the so-called “brinicle” met the sea bed, a web of ice formed that froze everything it touched, including sea urchins and starfish.* *The unusual phenomenon was filmed for the first time by cameramen Hugh Miller and Doug Anderson for the BBC One series “Frozen Planet.”*
