![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/02/americanmagicend2.jpg)Sometimes the magic just doesn’t happen. The New York Yacht Club’s [American Magic team, the U.S. Challenger was eliminated](https://americanmagic.americascup.com/en/news/90_AMERICAN-MAGIC-CONCLUDES-CAMPAIGN-FOR-36th-AMERICA-S-CUP.html) from competing in the 36th races for the America’s Cup.  The elimination follows four straight losses against the Challenger of Record, [Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli of Italy.](https://www.prada.com/us/en/pradasphere/special-projects/2020/luna-rossa-prada-pirelli-team.html)  The Luna Rossa team will now advance to the Finals of the Prada Cup where they will compete with [Ineos Team UK](https://www.ineosteamuk.com/) for the right to challenge the Defender, [Emirates Team New Zealand](https://emirates-team-new-zealand.americascup.com/), for the Cup in races starting on March 6.

The American Magic team really never recovered from the [disastrous crash and capsize](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/01/americas-cup-update-american-magic-capsizes-floods-the-race-to-repair-a-crippled-yacht/) that seriously damaged the boat *Patriot*‘s hull and destroyed much of its electronics and control systems, two weeks ago. After round-the-clock repairs and reconstruction, *Patriot* was able to return just in time to sail in the semifinal series. Completing the work in such a constrained time window was a victory in its own right. The victory, however, was short-lived.

The repairs to the boat also meant, however, that the American Magic team couldn’t sail in the Round-robin races 3 and 4, losing the opportunity to refine their skills aboard *Patriot*.  The team also suffered mechanical failure. During one race on Saturday, after taking a small early lead against *Luna Rosa*, *Patriot* experienced a malfunction of the Foil Cant System (FCS), losing the race by four minutes. [Spinsheet](https://www.spinsheet.com/racing/american-magic-eliminated-america%E2%80%99s-cup) quotes America’s Cup Hall of Fame member Gary Jobson who noted that “clearly the boat that went racing today wasn’t the same boat that we saw before the capsizing.”
