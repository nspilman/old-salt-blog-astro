![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seadronekerch.jpg)We recently posted [Ukrainian Naval Drones Redefining Warfare in the Black Sea](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2023/08/ukrainian-naval-drones-redefining-warfare-in-the-black-sea/), discussing naval drones developed by the Ukrainians with formidable ranges and increasing lethality. These sea drones are explosive uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) that have been used to attack Russian ships and shore infrastructure.

Now, following successful attacks by sea drones on one high value target, the bridge across the Kerch Strait which connects Russian-occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland, the Russians have fallen back on an ancient defensive technique, the use of [blockships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockship), to respond to a 21st century technology.

The [Ukrainian Ministry of Defence](https://gur.gov.ua/en/content/okupanty-zatopliuiut-poromy-shchob-zakhystyty-nezakonnyi-kerchenskyi-mist.html) reports that the Russians are preparing to sink a second ferry in the [Kerch Strait near the Crimean bridge](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2023/07/25/Ukraine-will-keep-attacking-targets-in-Crimea-and-Kerch-Bridge-Defense-chief) connecting Russian-occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland, to protect it from attacks by Ukrainian sea drones.

According to the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine, “in order to create a protective obstacle in front of the Kerch bridge, the occupiers plan to sink at least six ferries. The Russians intend to install boom barriers between sunken ferries. In this way, the enemy seeks to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge from further damage,” the Ukrainians noted in a statement.

The Ukrainians noted in addition that “the simplistic measure of protecting the 19-km bridge by sinking ferries in front of it proves feverish urgency of Moscow’s decision-making and the intellectual crisis within the military-political leadership of terrorist Russia.

Blockships have been used to block channels and to protect harbors since at least the 11th century. 

Near the beginning of the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, the [Russian Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Navy "Russian Navy") towed and scuttled the decommissioned cruiser [*Ochakov*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cruiser_Ochakov "Russian cruiser Ochakov") at the entrance to [Donuzlav Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Naval_Base_\(Ukraine\) "Southern Naval Base (Ukraine)") in western [Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea "Crimea"), to prevent remaining Ukrainian navy vessels from leaving port. Less than 24 hours later, another blockship, the former [Black Sea Fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet "Black Sea Fleet") rescue/diving support vessel *BM-416* was scuttled near *Ochakov*.

Whether the scuttled ferries will prove to be a successful defense against the Ukrainian sea drones remains to be seen.
