Admiral Washington?

In the United States, today is celebrated as Washington’s Birthday, also widely known as Presidents Day.  On this the official day of celebration of his birthday, it seems worthwhile to  look back on General George Washington’s navy of 1775 and 1776.

Washington was given command of the Continental Army on June 17th, 1775. The American army had surrounded and outnumbered the British army in Boston, but lacked both muskets, flints and gunpowder, as well as most other supplies. The British, on the other hand, were well supplied by sea. There were, however, fast schooners available in nearby Gloucester. Washington saw the opportunity to raid the British supply lines and supply his troops at the British expense.

In all Washington would send a total of eight armed schooners out to prey on British supply vessels. Oddly, these ships were neither privateers nor part of the as yet unformed Continental Navy. They were, instead, part of the Continental Army and in their 26 months of service, they would capture 55 enemy ships.

  
Washington began by chartering the 78-ton schooner *Hannah* from John Glover of Marblehead for “one Dollar pr Ton pr Month.”   A crew of 43 was recruited and on September 2, 1775, Washington commissioned Nicholson Broughton captain “in the Army of the United Colonies of North America,” in command of the *Hannah*.

Captain Broughton would have a decidedly mixed career, proving more effective at capturing  American owned ships than British transports.  John Manley, captain of the schooner *Lee,* would do much better.  Captain Manley captured the British brigantine *Nancy*, loaded with tons of ordnance and military stores intended for British troops, on November 28, 1775. The cargo included 2,000 muskets with bayonets, 105,000 flints, over 10,000 round shot, and one large 13″ brass mortar, as well as all the equipment to supply a a force of two thousand regulars in the field.
