![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/01/pappyspride.jpg)On Tuesday around 3:35 PM the Coast Guard in Galveston, TX was notified that a fishing boat, the 82′ long [*Pappy’s Pride*](https://www.balticshipping.com/vessel/imo/8940048), had collided with the 600-foot chemical tanker [*Bow Fortune*](https://www.odfjell.com/tankers/fleet/bow-fortune/). The fishing boat had capsized and four crew were in the water. [One crew member was subsequently rescued, one died and two remain missing.](https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2020/01/15/2-missing-1-dead-after-fishing-boat-collides-with-600-foot-chemical-tanker-in-galveston/)  The tanker was reported to be under pilotage at the time of the collision. Heavy fog was also reported to have limited visibility and to have hampered the search for the missing crew.

How the fishing vessel came to collide with the tanker is unclear. Photographs of *Pappy’s Pride* show radar and multiple radio antennas. Presumably, both vessels also had AIS.
