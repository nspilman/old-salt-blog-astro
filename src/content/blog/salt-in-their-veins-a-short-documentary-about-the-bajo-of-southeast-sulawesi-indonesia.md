[*Salt in their Veins*](https://youtu.be/xtBwopM8g7U?si=1elcShUR9MScsihm) is a breathtaking and thought-provoking short documentary by German photographer & filmmaker [Rita Hencke](https://www.ritahencke.com/). The documentary explores the lives of the [Bajo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajo) people of Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, descendants of sea nomads with a deep connection to the marine environment. Once ocean-roaming fishers and traders, the Bajo now face the stark realities of overfishing, pollution, and biodiversity loss as they adapt to life in coastal villages and stilted homes.

*Salt in Their Veins* has been internationally recognized, earning awards such as Best Direction at the 2024 Environmental Film & Screenplay Festival.
