![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Olavsvern.jpg)For only 105 million Norwegian krona (thats € 14 million or roughly US$17.5 million) you too can own an Arctic submarine base.  Norway’s [Olavsvern Naval Base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olavsvern) just outside the city of Tromsø, has been [on the market since January 2011](http://theforeigner.no/pages/news/naval-base-for-sale-in-norway/), but for the last several weeks has been [listed for sale on a Norwegian web site.](http://www.finn.no/finn/b2b/commercialproperty/sale/object?finnkode=34852272)  The base, Norway’s  only submarine base north of the  features  a large dock and a deep-water berth as well as a fuel depot, a tunnel system and emergency power system, all designed to withstand a nuclear attack.  Overall the base includes 13.500 square meters of buildings and a 25.000 square meter mountain plant.  You must provide your own submarines, however. No subs are included in the deal.  Also, the electric bills are reported to be rather large.  On the other hand, as pointed out in the [Geekologie blog](http://www.geekologie.com/2012/05/instant-evil-villain-status-secret-subma.php), a secret Arctic submarine base would confer “instant evil villain” status to the owner.
