The [Beacon Sloop Club is raising money to restore the Hudson River ferry sloop, Woody Guthrie](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-us-restore-the-ferry-sloop-woody-guthrie#/). G Since 1978, the sloop [Woody Guthrie](http://www.beaconsloopclub.org/Sloop.html) has given thousands of people their first experience on a sailboat and their first experience of the beauties of the Hudson River and the surrounding mountains from the vantage point of her deck, all for free, at no charge. The *Woody Guthrie* is a 46 foot gaff-rigged, traditional wooden sailboat similar in vintage to the [Hudson River sloop *Clearwater*](http://www.clearwater.org/). Smaller than the sloops that sailed up and down the river, the Woody is a replica of a Hudson River Ferry Sloop, that ferried folks and cargo from one side of the river to the other.

The [Beacon Sloop Club has raised $200,000](http://www.beaconsloopcluboffice.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=5) of the estimated $400,000 needed to do a complete restoration on the boat and needs your help in reaching the final $200,000.  [Click here to help them reach their goal.](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-us-restore-the-ferry-sloop-woody-guthrie#/)
