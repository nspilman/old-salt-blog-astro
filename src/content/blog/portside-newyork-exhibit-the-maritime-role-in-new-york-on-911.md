Two years ago we [posted about the largely overlooked maritime evacuation of lower Manhattan on 9/11](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/09/11/maritime-evacuation-on-911-%E2%80%93-an-american-dunkirk/).  With the bridges and tunnels shut down, between 350,000 and 500,000 people were evacuated by water in just a few hours. It was the largest maritime evacuation since Dunkirk and has gone largely unreported in the media.    Now on the tenth anniversary of the 9/11attacks, [PortSide NewYork is mounting a multi-media exhibit](http://portsidetanker.blogspot.com/2011/08/portside-newyork-exhibit-about-maritime.html)  (photography, videos and oral history) about the extraordinary and little-known maritime role in 9/11, from evacuation to rubble removal.

The exhibit and presentations will be held on the historic [1933 U.S. Lighthouse Tender *Lilac*](http://www.lilacpreservationproject.org/) docked at [Hudson River Park’s Pier 25](http://pier25.com/) in Manhattan.   The exhibit opens Thursday, September 8th and will feature presentations by [Carolina Salguero](http://www.carolinasalguero.com/), photojournalist on 9/11 and now Director of [PortSide NewYork](http://portsidenewyork.org/) and engineer and journalist [Jessica DuLong](http://www.jessicadulong.com/), who was chief engineer of retired New York City [Fireboat *John J. Harvey*](http://www.fireboat.org/), the first fireboat to respond at Ground Zero on on 9/11.

[PortSide NewYork](http://portsidenewyork.org/) is a waterfront-themed non-profit organization. [More about the exhibit here.](http://portsidetanker.blogspot.com/2011/08/portside-newyork-exhibit-about-maritime.html)
