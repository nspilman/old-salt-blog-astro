![volvooceanrace1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/volvooceanrace1.jpg)The route for the 2017-2018 [Volvo Ocean Race](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/) has been announced and it is the longest and toughest of the competition’s 43 year history. The race around the world will begin in Alicante, Spain in November of next year and end eight months later in the Netherlands. The race will visit eleven cities and cover 45,000 nautical miles, of which 12,500nm will be raced in the brutal Southern Ocean.  New Volvo Ocean Race CEO Mark Turner describes the race as, “More action, more speed, more tough miles and more host venues, but a shorter race – it’s an evolution in the right direction.” The competitors will be racing in [Volvo Ocean 65s](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/boat/36_It-s-not-just-about-the-boat.html), 65′ one-design mono-hulls designed by Farr Yacht Design.
