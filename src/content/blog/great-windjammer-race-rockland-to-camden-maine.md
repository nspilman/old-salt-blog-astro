Last Friday, 19 schooners sailed from the starting line near the Breakwater Lighthouse in Rockland, Me out into Penobscott, Bay and then into Camden, Me, for the 36th annual Great Windjammer Race.  After the breakneck speeds of America’s Cup catamarans, the stately pace of the old schooners is almost soothing. The race is sponsored yearly by the [Maine Windjammer Association](http://www.sailmainecoast.com/).  Thanks to Irwin Bryan for passing along the article.
