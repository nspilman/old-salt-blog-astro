![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/08/leeuwin.jpg)At about 6:15 this morning, local time, the [*Maersk Shekou*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/9466984), a 332 meter, 8,814 TEU container ship struck and dismasted the STS [*Leeuwin II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS_Leeuwin_II) berthed at Victoria Quay in Fremantle, Australia’s inner harbor. The container ship also hit the nearby [WA Maritime Museum](https://visit.museum.wa.gov.au/maritime).

Two crew members standing night watch on board the *Leeuwin* suffered injuries and were taken to a local hospital. Their injuries were described as significant but not life-threatening.

Fremantle Ports said the allision damaged the sailing boat’s masts and superstructure, but the hull appeared to not have sustained major damage.

The bow of the *Maersk Shekou* struck the *Leeuwin* first, with the stern of the vessel then hitting A Berth and the roof of the Maritime Museum.

The allision damaged the hull of the *Maersk Shekou*, which was being accompanied into port by four tug boats.

[ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-30/several-injured-in-leeuwin-accident-fremantle-port/104289764) reported that the *Maersk Shekou* had encountered sudden bad weather before the collision. An investigation has been launched into the incident.

[Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation](https://sailleeuwin.com/) chair Jay Weatherill said the Leeuwin won’t be sailing “any time soon”.

“You can see that there’s obviously been catastrophic damage to the mast and the rigging,” he said.

“We are determined though to make sure that we do restore this vessel. This is a much-loved Australian icon.”

Based in Fremantle, the STS *Leeuwin* is a tall ship owned and operated by youth development charity Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation.

The 55-metre long, three-masted, steel-hulled, 1850s-inspired barquentine is used in sailing training for young people across Western Australia.
