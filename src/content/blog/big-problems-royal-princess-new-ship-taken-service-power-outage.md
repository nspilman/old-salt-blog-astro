![Royal_Princess1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/09/Royal_Princess1.jpg)If you take a cruise on a ship owned by Carnival, you may want to bring along a flashlight. The newest [Princess Cruises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Cruises) ship, the *[Royal Princess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Princess_\(2013\))*, suffered a power outage while sailing between Mykonos and Naples.  [Power was reported to be out for between three and four hours](http://www.cruisecritic.com/news/news.cfm?ID=5537). The ship, carrying 3,594 passengers and 1,336 crew, was on the seventh day of a 12-day voyage from Venice.  The cruise has been cancelled and passengers will disembark in Naples. The ship will then be taken out of service for repairs.  The power outage may not be the only problem on the ship. As reported by [Cruise Critic](http://www.cruisecritic.com/news/news.cfm?ID=5537):  *A Princess Facebook fan posted on Princess’ page today that “the ship has had many other problems in the past eight days, plumbing, electrical, air-conditioning, and last night we were delayed leaving Mykonos for over four hours because they couldn’t get the anchor up.”*   The *Royal Princess* entered service in June of this year after being christened by the Duchess of Cambridge.  [Princess Cruises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Cruises) is a subsidiary of [Carnival Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_Corporation_%26_plc).

Carnival has been having some trouble keeping the lights on its ships. In November 2010, the [*Carnival Splendor* suffered a fire and a blackout](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/carnival-splendor-catches-fire-off-mexico-ship-dead-in-the-water/) while on cruise in the Pacific.  The ship was adrift off Mexico for four days before arriving under tow to San Diego.  The *Carnival Splendor* is a sister ship to the *Costa Concordia,* owned by the Carnival subsdiary Costa Lines. In February 2012, the [*Costa Allegra*, also suffered a power outage](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/02/cruise-ship-costa-allegra-adrift-off-seychelles/) after an engine room fire, while in the Indian Ocean and need to be towed to port in the Seychelles.  In February 2013, the [*Carnival Triumph* suffered a fire and blackout](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/02/carnival-triumph-another-blacked-out-drifting-cruise-ship-why-again-a-common-design-flaw-in-modern-cruise-ships/) while the Gulf of Mexico, stranding passengers for days in very uncomfortable conditions. Then only a month later, the [*Carnival Dream* suffered a power outage](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/03/carnival-nightmare-power-failure-on-carnival-dream-at-dockside-sends-passengers-home/) while at the dock at Philipsburg, St. Maarten, in the eastern Caribbean, resulting in the cancellation of the cruise.
