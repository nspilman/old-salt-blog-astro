![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/08/baltica.jpg)Interesting news from various sources on the first large tanker to transit Russia’s Northeast Passage through the Arctic.  The [Barents Observer](http://www.barentsobserver.com/first-high-tonnage-tanker-through-northeast-passage.4809756-16175.html) reports that the “*100,000 tons tanker Baltica left Murmansk on Saturday loaded with gas condensate for China. This is the first time a high-tonnage tanker takes the Northern Sea Route from Europe to Asia.”* The Barents Observer also reports, *” The tanker will be followed by the nuclear ice breakers “Rossiya”, “Taymyr” and “50 years of Victory”. The latter will have divers and specialists on oil spill clean-up as well as necessary equipment. “*  
  
*[Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-16/russia-uses-nuclear-icebreakers-to-send-oil-to-china-via-arctic-not-suez.html) reports that the ship is carrying 70,000 tons of gas concentrate and that the ship is being accompanied by two rather than three nuclear icebreakers.   It also quotes Keith Bainbridge, a partner in charge of gas at [RS Platou LLP](http://www.platou.com/dnn_site/Default.aspx), questioning the economic justification for such a voyage, saying, “The fact that there are two icebreakers for a small ship would imply that there is no economic justification for the route, for condensate or LNG.”*
