![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ronbrown.jpg)NOAA’s largest oceanographic research vessel, [*Ronald H. Brown*](http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/vessels/ronbrown/ronbrown.html), is based in Charleston, SC, although if you haven’t seen her in her homeport for quite a while, you are not alone. She only recently returned from a record deployment of 1,347 days, which is to say 3 years, 8 months and 7 days in service. During the lengthy deployment, the research vessel spent nearly 800 days at sea and traveled nearly 130,000 miles conducting scientific research and servicing buoys that collect a wide variety of environmental data.

From the [NOAA press release](http://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-research-ship-returns-to-charleston-home-port-after-worldwide-deployment):

“*My congratulations and thanks to the officers and crew of NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown for their hard work, dedication and service during this extended and unprecedented deployment,” said Rear Adm. David A. Score, director of NOAA’s Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. “Working from ocean to ocean and from pole to pole, the ship and her crew have expanded our understanding of some of nature’s most powerful forces.”*

*The 274-ft. ship is a global-class oceanographic and atmospheric research platform operated by NOAA’s Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, which is comprised of civilians and NOAA Corps officers. Up to 60 officers, crew and scientists were on the ship at one time. A ceremony was held in Charleston today to welcome the crew home. …*

*The Brown won’t be home for long: she is scheduled to head right back to sea in April for a series of ocean climate studies.
