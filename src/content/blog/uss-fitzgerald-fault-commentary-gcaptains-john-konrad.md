![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gcaptainnbridge.jpg)gCaptain’s [Captain John Konrad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gcaptain/) has a excellent [post today](https://gcaptain.com/uss-fitzgerald-fault/) that describes in detail why he believes that the destroyer*USS Fitzgerald* was at fault in its recent collision with the container ship *ACX Crystal*.  He suggests a simple rule for avoiding collisions with Navy warships is missing: “If it’s grey stay away.”

Konrad details the likely communications failures on the *Fitzgerald,* which are endemic on most Navy ships. He also describes the difference in training and focus of the merchant versus the naval captain, as well as the resources available to and responsibilities of each. And, no, he does not argue that the USS Fitzgerald was *solely* at fault. As he points out, “Under COLREGS, whenever two ships touch each other, both ships are to blame.”

Rather than quote specific passages of the post, go to gCaptain to read it in full. It is worth reading.
