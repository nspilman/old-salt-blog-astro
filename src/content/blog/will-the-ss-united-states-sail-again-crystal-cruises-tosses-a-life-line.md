A rendering of the proposed redesign of the S.S. United States

In October, the [SS United States Conservancy](http://www.ssusc.org/) announced that it had [retained the services of a broker](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/11/temporary-reprieve-for-ss-united-states/) to explore selling the [SS *United States*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States) for scrap. Prospects for the ship looked dire. In a dramatic reversal of fortune, [Crystal Cruises](http://www.crystalcruises.com/) has signed an [option to purchase the ship](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/business/ss-united-states-historic-ocean-liner-of-trans-atlantic-heyday-may-sail-again.html?_r=0). In the past few years, the Conservancy has been looking for buyers or investors to turn the iconic passenger liner into a hotel, casino or convention center. This is the first proposal that we have seen to return the ship to full operation as a cruise ship.

The purchase is not a “done deal.”  The agreement calls for Crystal Cruises to cover the ship expenses of $60,0000 per month for nine months while they perform a feasibility study. Bringing the ship back into service could cost from $700 million to $800 million according to Crystal’s chief executive, Edie Rodriguez. If all goes well, the ship, which had a capacity for 1,928 passengers and 900 crew, would operate as an 800 passenger luxury cruise ship in worldwide service.

If Crystal Cruises moves forward, they have a huge job ahead of them. SS *United States* operated from 1952-1969. In 1984, the ship’s interior, including furniture and fitting, was sold at auction. In 1994, what was left of the interior was stripped out when the ship’s asbestos was removed in a Turkish shipyard.

The ship’s 240,000 hp steam plant, which was an engineering marvel of its day, is now obsolete and far too expensive to operate, even if it was in any condition to run. All of the ship’s mechanical and electrical systems will need to be replaced. All cable, electrical equipment such as capacitors and transformers,  as well as gaskets. which contain toxic PCBs, will have to be removed and disposed of.

Crystal Cruises would essentially be buying the shell of a historic ship, which could, at least potentially, make the conversion to a modern cruise ship easier. The plan is to keep the iconic profile. As reported by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/business/ss-united-states-historic-ocean-liner-of-trans-atlantic-heyday-may-sail-again.html?_r=0): *A concept rendering of the S.S. United States makeover shows a ship with its signature twin red, white and blue stacks and the same number of decks, a spokesman said, in contrast with the top-heavy silhouette of some modern cruise liners.*

*The decks, however, are extended and expanded to accommodate rooms with balconies, something the original design never had.*

If Crystal Cruises does purchase the SS *United States* is will be the second time that Crystal Cruises chairman, Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, has attempted to convert the ship. Mr. Lim is also chairman of Genting, Crystal Cruises parent company, which also has a controlling interest in [Norwegian Cruise Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Cruise_Line) (NCL).  NCL owned SS *United States* from 2003 to 2010. Mr. Lim was also chairman of NCL during the period. During that time, NCL completed detailed engineering studies related to converting the ship for the Hawaiian trade.
