![Clipper Stad Amsterdam2_790](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/02/Clipper-Stad-Amsterdam2_790.jpg)It is generally considered rude to look under a lady’s skirt, though when the lady is a ship in a drydock, it is usually OK.   The three masted steel clipper [*Stad Amsterdam*](http://www.stadamsterdam.com/) was built in 2000 and now after 13 years of service is undergoing a major overhaul at [Damen Shiprepair](http://www.damen.nl/en/news/2013/01/second-youth-for-clipper-stad-amsterdam) in Vlissingen, the Netherlands. She should return to service sometime early June.  It is a great opportunity to look at the graceful lines of her hull, normally hidden below the waterline. The ship was designed by [Gerard Dijkstra](http://www.gdnp.nl/) who modeled her after the mid-19th century frigate Amsterdam. She has been described as a “modern extreme clipper in historical perspective.” She is a very fast ship capable of sailing along at an easy 15 knots. Video of the *Stad Amsterdam* under sail after the jump.
