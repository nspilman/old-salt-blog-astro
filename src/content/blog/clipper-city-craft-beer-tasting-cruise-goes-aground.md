![cc1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/cc1.jpg)The topsail schooner *[Clipper City](https://www.manhattanbysail.com/About-Us/Our-Boats/Clipper-City-More-Information/)* set sail from Manhattan yesterday on a “[Craft Beer Tasting Cruise](http://www.manhattanbysail.com/Craft-Beer-Tasting-Sails/),” which ran somewhat longer than expected. The steel ship grounded in New York harbor, south of the Statue of Liberty. Apparently many of the passengers were not aware of the grounding until boats came to ferry them ashore. All 121 passengers made it to shore safely.  As the ship grounded near low tide, she floated free when the tide came in, without any reported damage to the ship or pollution of the harbor. What’s the old saying? “If you’ve never run aground, then you’re not much of a sailor.”  And no doubt, the craft beer was tasty.
