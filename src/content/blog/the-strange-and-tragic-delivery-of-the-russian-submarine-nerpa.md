![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/160275822.jpg)Next month, the Russian nuclear submarine, *Nerpa*, will be delivered to the Indian Navy, which has leased the submarine for a reported $900 million from the Russians for ten years with an option to buy.  The delivery of the new nuclear sub to India, which will be renamed INS *Chakra,* has been long, strange and ultimately tragic.  
  
Construction of the *Nerpa*,  an Akula-II class nuclear submarine began in 1993 but was halted for lack of funds. [In 2002 secret negotiations began](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/The+secret+nuke+sub+deal/1/1024.html) between India and Russia for India to lease two submarines, later reduced to one, as well as other Russian military hardware, including an aircraft carrier and four strategic bombers.

The *Nerpa* was supposed to be delivered in 2007 but faced numerous construction delays.  In November 2008 when the ship was on sea trials, 20 sailors and technicains died when a fire suppressant system on the sub was accidentally triggered. Reportedly [someone had replaced the Freon in the system](http://en.rian.ru/mlitary_news/20110516/164054151.html) with a mix of Freon and trichloroethylene, an industrial solvent.

*Yakov Agapov, a former senior medical officer with Russia’s Pacific Fleet, said that instead of pure freon, the Nerpa’s firefighting system contained a “lethal” mixture of freon and trichloroethylene, which is commonly used as an industrial solvent and is highly corrosive.*

*“Trichloroethylene knocks you off instantly,” Agapov said. “If there had been high-quality freon \[in the system\], the people would have had a few minutes to put on portable breathing equipment.”*

*He said this mixture was an estimated 5.5 million rubles ($198,500) cheaper than freon.*

*“They stole the freon and replaced it with a poison, that is why people were killed,” Prikhodko said. “Where that freon went and who stole it remains an open question.”*

The *Nerpa*‘s captain and an engineer were charged with negligence in the deaths, but [these charges were dropped last week by a jury in Vladivostok](http://en.rian.ru/russia/20110930/167267205.html).

Barring other mishaps the *Nerpa* will be transferred to the Indian Navy next month.
