Way back in 1984, I worked for Malcom McLean’s United States Lines, when the 4,400 TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit) containership, the *American New York,* was delivered. She was this first of McLean’s fleet of “Jumbo Econships.”   In those days, he was criticized for building ships that were too big for most ports to handle.  I am reminded of this by the arrival of the 12,565 TEU containership, *MSC Fabiola*, in the Port of Long Beach last Friday.  She is the largest container ship ever to call on a US port.

*The Fabiola, owned by Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Co., can carry 12,500 containers. The ship is just 30 feet shorter than the Empire State Building is tall, as wide as a 10-lane freeway and big enough to carry the contents of eight 1-million-square-foot warehouses.*

As large as the *MSC Fabiola* may be, she is slightly smaller than the Maersk E Class container ships, which each can carry up to 14,770 TEU.  Maersk also has under construction in Korea a fleet of 20 “Triple E” class container ships for devilvery by 2014 which will each have a capacity of 18,000 TEU.

Ironically, containerization was developed in the Untied States, but most ports and terminals are too small to handle the new generations of large container ships.
