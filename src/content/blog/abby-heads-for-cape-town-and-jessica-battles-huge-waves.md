Abby Sunderland

Abby Sunderland’s attempt to become the youngest sailor to sail around the world non-stop ended as she decided to put into Cape Town due to mechanical failures.  The boat’s main autopilot has been giving her problems during the voyage recently failed.    She intends to continue her sail around the world following her stop for repairs.   Her stop will means that she will no longer be challenging Jessica Watson for the title of youngest non-stop circumnavigator.   Both Abby and Jessica are sixteen.

Jessica Watson, on the last leg of her attempt at a non-stop circumnavigation, has been buffeted by high waves, what she describes as “10 meter liquid mountains” that came close to capsizing her boat. Watson is roughly two weeks away from completing her circumnavigation.
