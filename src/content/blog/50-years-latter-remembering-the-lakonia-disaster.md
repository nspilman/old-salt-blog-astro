![lakoniaBurning1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lakoniaBurning1.jpg)The brochure for for the cruise liner [*Lakonia*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMS_Lakonia) promised “*A MARVELOUS CHRISTMAS CRUISE TO SUNNY MADEIRA AND THE CANARY ISLANDS…HAVE YOUR HOLIDAY WITH ALL RISK ELIMINATED. ENJOY A HOLIDAY YOU WILL REMEMBER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.*”

Now fifty years later, the survivors and families of those aboard remember the last cruise of the *Lakonia,* which ended in disaster and the loss of 128 passengers and crew. Earlier this month, survivors unveiled a plaque on Gibraltar to commemorate those lost.  As reported by the *[Gibraltar Chronicle](http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=32016):*

*The plaque was commissioned by the Gibraltar Heritage Trust to commemorate the terrible night when the cruise ship caught fire off the coast of Madeira in the Atlantic and lost 128 lives. Of those who perished 58 were buried in North Front Cemetery in Gibraltar, but since then most have been repatriated. There are 14 graves remaining now, nine in the Protestant area, two in the Catholic area and three in the Jewish cemetery.*

On December 22, 1963, while sailing north of the island of Madeira, a fire started in a shipboard beauty salon on the *Lakonia,* which spread rapidly and was soon burning out of control.  There were 1,022 aboard, 646 passengers and 376 crewmen.

Within four hours, the Argentinian liner, *Salta*, arrived at the burning ship and began rescuing passengers and crew. A half an hour later the British tanker, *Montcalm,* joined the rescue.  They would be joined by the Belgian ship *Charlesville*, the Brazilian freighter *Rio Grande*, the British passenger ship *Stratheden*, the Panamanian freighter *Mehdi* and British aircraft carrier *HMS Centaur*. Four United States Air Force C-54 planes from the Lajes Air Base in the Azores dropped flares, lifejackets, life rafts and survival kits to people in the water.

Of the total of 128 people who died in the *Lakonia* disaster, 95 passengers and 33 crew, only 53 people were killed in the fire. The rest died from exposure, drowning and injuries sustained while leaving the ship.
