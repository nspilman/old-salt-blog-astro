The [Charleston Harbor Fest](http://www.charlestonharborfest.org/) which begins tomorrow and runs through Sunday features a mix of old and new on the water.  The four competing ECO 60 sailboats in the [Velux 5 Oceans](http://www.velux5oceans.com) Around the World Race will be on display as will the three traditional vessels, the schooners *[Pride of  Baltimore II](http://www.pride2.org/index.php)*,  the *[Spirit of South Carolina](http://www.scmaritime.org/)*, and the [brigantine *Fritha*](http://sailscape.blogspot.com/2006/07/brigantine-fritha-out-of-newport.html).  Sharp-built privateers like the *Pride of Baltimore* were among the fastest vessels on the way in their day, so it seems fitting that they are joined by the ECO 60s which are among the fasting sailing vessels of our time.

*Velux 5 Oceans is set to be the centrepiece of Charleston Harbor Fest, a four-day celebration of all things nautical. Visitors will be able to see first-hand the four Velux 5 Oceans Eco 60 yachts as their skippers prepare for ocean sprint five, the final leg of the 30,000-mile solo round the world yacht race.*

*Tickets are available online for a special Bon Voyage reception with the Velux 5 Oceans skippers from 5pm to 8pm on Friday, May 13. Saturday will feature a dockside send-off ceremony and Parade of Sail accompanying the Velux 5 Oceans racers as they head out to the start line for the final charge back to La Rochelle, France, starting at 1500.*

*During the festival the four ocean-going Eco 60s will line up alongside four impressive tallships including Spirit of South Carolina, a 140ft double-masted schooner operated by Harbor Fest organisers the South Carolina Maritime Foundation.*

*Harbor Fest will also feature the Velux tent which will host the grinding challenge, plus the Maersk Line Climate Box, an interactive exhibit housed inside a prototype container which gives the community insight about the effects of global shipping. The Education Village will focus on sustainability, while at the Kids’ Zone youngsters can build model yachts, learn to tie a monkey’s fist knot or play on a huge inflatable slide.*

*Located at the Charleston Maritime Center, Harbor Fest is open from 1300 to 1800 on Thursday May 12 and Friday May 13. On Saturday festival hours are 1000 to 1800, and Sunday 1000 until 1600. A single entry price of $10 in advance and $15 at the gate will provide access for the entire weekend. Advance ticket purchases along with lots of information about the event can be found on the website.*
