![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Falls_of_Clyde1.jpg)Things look grim for the 1878 sailing ship *[Falls of Clyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_of_Clyde_\(ship\))*, the last surviving iron-hulled, four-masted full-rigged ship, and the only remaining sail-driven oil tanker.  There is still a glimmer of hope that she can be saved, but time is running out. Recently, a campaign has gotten underway to return the ship to Scotland where it was built 138 years ago.

On Friday, an [administrative hearing upheld the State of Hawaii’s Department of Transportation’s right](http://khon2.com/2016/09/30/state-upholds-impoundment-of-historic-ship-at-honolulu-harbor/) to take control of the ship from its current owners, the nonprofit [Friends of the Falls of Clyde](http://www.friendsoffallsofclyde.org/). In June, the DOT revoked the ship’s permit to moor at Pier 7 in Honolulu harbor and then impounded the ship in August. The Friends of the Falls of Clyde has owned the ship for the last eight years but has not raised the necessary funds to drydock her, as the first step in ship’s restoration. The concern now is that the State of Hawaii may choose to scrap or sink the *Falls of Clyde*.
