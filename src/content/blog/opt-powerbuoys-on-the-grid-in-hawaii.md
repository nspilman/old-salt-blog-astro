PowerBuoy

Recently we have been posting about the PowerBuoys developed by Ocean Power Technology.  They will soon be connected to the word’s largest  [“Wave Hub” off the coast of England.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/09/13/worlds-biggest-wave-energy-site-off-cornish-coast-set-to-go-live/) They are also working toward deploying their [buoys off the Oregon coast.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/09/06/energy-from-waves-in-oregon-and-maine/) Ocean Power Technologies announced this week the completion of the first-ever grid connection of a wave energy device in the United States.  There is a video of the PowerBuoy in waves after the jump.

*OPT‟s system, which is named PowerBuoy, has been designed to produce utilities-grade, renewable energy that can be transmitted to the electricity grid through wave energy technology.*

*The successful connection has been deployed approximately three-quarters of a mile off the coast of Oahu in water depth of 100 feet.*

*In its test series, the PowerBuoy produced power from over 4,400 hours of operation, using numerous on-board sensors that analysed the performance of actual in-coming wave conditions.*
