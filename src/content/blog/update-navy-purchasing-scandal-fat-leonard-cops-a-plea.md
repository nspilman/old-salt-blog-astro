. ………………………………….  “Fat Leonard” Glen Francis

In October 2013, [we posted that a US Navy purchasing scandal sounded like a bad novel](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/11/fat-leonard-prostitutes-lady-gaga-tickets-third-officer-charged-in-navy-bribery-scandal/).  Bribes, prostitutes, and Lady Gaga tickets were allegedly handed out to US Navy officers by a Malaysian businessman in exchange for classified information and directing business toward the Singapore-based contractor, [Glenn Defense Marine Asia](http://www.glennmarinegroup.com/) (GDMA.) GMDA was accused of overcharging the Navy tens of millions of dollars for port services.

The drama is not over, but it is winding down. Leonard Glenn Francis, known is military circles as “Fat Leonard,” pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges in federal court Thursday.  Francis, chief executive of GDMA, faces up to 25 years in prison and will forfeit $35 million to the US government, according to the plea agreement.

Also pleading guilty was Captain Daniel Dusek, the highest-ranking Navy officer to enter a guilty plea in the case.  Captain Dusek served as the former deputy director of operations for the 7th Fleet and later commanding officer of the amphibious assault ships USS *Essex* and USS *Bonhomme Richard*.   Earlier this month, Commander Jose Luis Sanchez also pleaded guilty to providing Frances with classified information.  An agent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, John Beliveau II, and a manager for the contractor, Alex Wisidagama, who is Francis’ cousin, have also pleaded guilty.

The investigation into the scandal is not over. As reported by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/16/us/fourth-navy-official-pleads-guilty-in-bribery-scandal.html): *The court records indicated that Mr. Francis had already given prosecutors the names of seven Navy officials to whom he said he paid bribes in exchange for help. They include Captain Dusek and the three others who have pleaded guilty, and a fifth official, Cmdr. Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz, who is fighting charges in the case. The other two identified by Mr. Francis were described in his plea agreement as a Navy contract specialist and a lieutenant commander. Neither of them was named, and neither has been charged.*
