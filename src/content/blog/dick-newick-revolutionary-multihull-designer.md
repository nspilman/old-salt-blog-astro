Before-Newick, trimarans were ugly and boxy. Newick’s designs, when they first arrived in the 70s and 80s, seemed almost other-worldly, with sweeping lines and amas that rested lightly on the water.

The first Newick design to catch the world’s attention was not a trimaran but a proa.  Newick designed [*Cheers*](http://www.wingo.com/newick/cheers.html), for  Tom Follett who placed third in the [Observers Single-handed Trans-Atlantic Race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-Handed_Trans-Atlantic_Race) (OSTAR) of 1968, the first multihull to place in the race. Soon Newick designed trimarans were winning ocean races around the world.   In 1980 Phil Weld sailed, [*Moxie*](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie), a Newick designed trimaran to win OSTAR, the first American ever to do so. Weld set a new race record of 17 days 23 hours and 12 minutes.

Over his long career, Newick designed more that 130 sailboats, ranging from the 60′ [*Rogue Wave*](http://www.wingo.com/newick/roguewave.html) to the 23′ [*Tremilino*](http://smalltrimarans.com/blog/?p=605).  Dick was quoted as saying, “*People sail for fun and no one has yet convinced me that it’s more fun to go slow than it is to go fast.*”

Moxie

Somewhere in a closet or dresser drawer, I have a bright orange *Moxie* t-shirt which I bought from Phil Weld at a boat show the year after he won the OSTAR.  At the show, *Moxie* was on display alongside the dock. She was sleek and beautiful, a work of art, as well as a very fast sailboat.  Sadly, [Weld died of a heart attack](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1984/11/8/famed-sailor-philip-s-weld-dies/#), only three years later, in 1984 and now Dick Newick, the creative master who designed the boat, has also passed away.   Last I read, [Moxie is still sailing in the South of France](http://www.moxie.fr/).
