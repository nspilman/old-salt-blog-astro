![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ussessex.jpg)[USS *Essex*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Essex_\(LHD-2\)), a [Wasp-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasp-class_amphibious_assault_ship) amphibious assault ship, recently arrived in Hawaii’s Pearl Harbor. Rather than carrying just helicopters, MV-22 Osprey tiltrotors, or even F-35B Lightning II fighter jets, the [ship had a deck load of historic World War II warplanes.](https://taskandpurpose.com/.amp/history/world-war-ii-warbirds-uss-essex-hawaii) The planes are set to take part in a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the end of WWII from August 29 to September 2.

The *Essex* carried a B-25 bomber, two PBY Catalina flying boats, an SNJ/AT-6 Texan, four AT-6 Texans, an FM2 Wildcat, F8F Bearcat, Stearman biplane, TBM Avenger, P-51 Mustang and a T-28 Trojan. 

The B-25 bomber was the same type of plane used in the [Doolittle Raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolittle_Raid), an April 18, 1942 air raid on the Japanese capital of Toyko when sixteen B-25B Mitchell medium bombers were launched from the U.S. Navy’s aircraft carrier [USS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Hornet_\(CV-8\)) *Hornet.* Notably, while the USS *Essex* is an amphibious assault ship rather than a carrier, she is still larger and with twice the displacement of the carrier *Hornet* of 1942. 

[According to the Navy](https://www.dvidshub.net/image/6304034/warbirds-arrive-pearl-harbor), the theme for this year’s commemoration is “Salute Their Service, Honor Their Hope” in recognition of the WWII veterans and civilians who contributed to the end of the war. 

The commemoration itself will include three “Legacy of Peace” flyovers of the aircraft culminating with an official ceremony on USS *Missouri* on Sept. 2.
