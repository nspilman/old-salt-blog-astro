![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hmsdiamondun.jpg)[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-uk-forces-shoot-down-houthi-missile-drone-attack-red-sea-us-military-2024-01-10/) reports that US and British naval forces shot down 21 drones and missiles fired by Yemen-based Houthis on Tuesday towards the southern Red Sea, with Britain hinting at further measures to protect international shipping lanes.

Eighteen drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile were shot down by F/A-18 warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS *Dwight D Eisenhower*, which is deployed in the Red Sea, and by four destroyers, the USS *Gravely*, USS *Laboon*, USS *Mason* and HMS *Diamond*. HMS *Diamond* shot down seven of the Houthi drones using its guns and Sea Viper missiles.

British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said it was the largest attack in the area by the militants to date as the three-month-long war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza spills over into other parts of the Middle East.

“This is an unsustainable situation,” Shapps told reporters, adding “watch this space” with regards to further possible action by Britain and its international partners. “This cannot continue and cannot be allowed to continue.”

US Central Command said no injuries nor damage were reported in Tuesday’s attack, adding that this was the 26th Houthi attack on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea since Nov. 19.
