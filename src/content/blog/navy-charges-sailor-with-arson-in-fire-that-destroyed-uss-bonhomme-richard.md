![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/firebhr.jpg)Last August we posted “[Did an Arsonist Torch the USS Bonhomme Richard?](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/08/did-an-arsonist-torch-the-uss-bonhomme-richard/)” The Navy has concluded that the answer is yes, as it has charged a seaman apprentice with deliberately starting a fire last year that destroyed the amphibious assault USS *Bonhomme Richard*, one of the worst blazes to engulf an American warship outside of combat.

The [sailor was a member of the crew](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/bonhomme-richard-fire.html?searchResultPosition=1) when the fire broke out last July and faces a hearing that will determine whether there will be a court-martial.

Last July, an [explosion and fire were reported](https://news.usni.org/2020/07/13/fire-fight-intensifies-on-uss-bonhomme-richard-5-sailors-still-hospitalized) aboard the amphibious assault ship [USS *Bonhomme Richard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bonhomme_Richard_\(LHD-6\)) dockside at the Naval Base San Diego. The fire raged for four days before being brought under control. More than sixty firefighters and contractors were reported to have been injured in fighting the fire.

In December the Navy determined that the [ship was too badly damaged to be repaired](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/12/uss-bonhomme-richard-to-be-scrapped-a-glimpse-inside-the-charred-wreckage/) and decided to scrap her. According to the U.S. Naval Institute, the ship, which cost an estimated $761 million to build, was [sold for $3.66 million](https://news.usni.org/2021/05/05/bonhomme-richard-wreck-reaches-panama-texas-shipbreaker-buys-hull-for-3-66m) to a company in Brownsville, Texas, that will break it apart and sell the metal for scrap.
