The [US Coast Guard Barque Eagle](http://www.cga.edu/eagle.aspx?id=2558) visited Brooklyn, New York this weekend and was open to visitors. She is beautifully maintained and staffed by smart, eager and enthusiastic cadets. Most of the cadets had been aboard for roughly one day, so as tour guides they lacked certain skills but their excitement about sailing the ship made up for any shortcomings.
