On Monday, February 24th, at 7:30 PM, New York’s Shiplore and Model Club, the city’s oldest nautical interest group, will be hosting a screening of the documentary “*[The Mystery of the Arctic Rose](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/disasters-at-sea/the-arctic-rose-mystery/1005669/3478922),”*  which examines the deadliest U.S. fishing accident in 50 years. 

I participated in the documentary and will be making a few comments on the tragic sinking and the particular challenges of fishing vessel safety. The documentary is a production of Exploration Production Inc. in association with Smithsonian Networks and Discovery Canada and is a part of the series, “[Disasters at Sea](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/disasters-at-sea/1005669).”

The screening will be held at Gerry Weinstein’s loft at 80 White Street in downtown Manhattan. Feel free to stop by if you are in the area.
