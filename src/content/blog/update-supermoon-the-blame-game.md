![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/05/fullmoon_lick_big.jpg)We recently posted “[Beware the Supermoon! Wonder What They Will Blame on it This Time?](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/05/03/beware-the-supermoon-wonder-what-they-will-blame-on-it-this-time/)”   We noted that previous perigean full moons, when the moon is closest in its orbit to the earth, have been blamed for ship groundings and even the sinking of the *Titanic*.  Both claims are more than a bit silly.

In the previous post, we wondered what would be blamed on this “supermoon.”  We now have the answer.  In a column in the [Chicago Tribune,](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-201205151600--tms--lizsmittr--x-a20120516-20120516,0,4261425.story) Liz Smith, gossip columnist and apparently an astrology buff writes: “*World astrologists took plenty of notice recently when the “Super Moon” was close to Earth. Europeans gave it credit for the fact that the very next day the governments of France and Greece imploded!”*   Really?  And we thought sailors were the superstitious ones.
