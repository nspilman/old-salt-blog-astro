![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/07/drifthydrotest.jpg)The 18′ foiling catamaran seen recently flying over the waves off the coast of Essex in the UK, was a small boat testing a very big concept. As it flew during the two-hour sea trial, the boat drove an underwater turbine that generated electricity which then used electrolysis to split seawater into hydrogen and oxygen. 

During the test run, the generator filled a six-liter storage tank with clean, green hydrogen; the only by-product was oxygen, which was vented. The boat actually produced so much electricity that, if the tank had been bigger, it could have made 60 liters of hydrogen.

[Drift Energy](https://drift.energy/), the British startup behind the project, claims that the foiling sailboat is the first in the world to generate clean hydrogen using just the power of the wind while under sail. 

“This is a real breakthrough in the creation of a new renewable energy class—which is both mobile, scalable, and anti-fragile,” Drift Energy’s CEO Ben Medland said in a statement. “We are thrilled to have produced the world’s first green hydrogen from a hydrofoil sailboat in the waters off Brightlingsea.”

Drift Energy says it is aiming to trial the technology on a [130-foot yacht within a year](https://robbreport.com/motors/marine/drift-energy-flying-hydrogen-yacht-1234726446/). A vessel that size would be capable of producing in excess of 55,000 gallons of hydrogen per hour. 

The company teamed up with [AI firm Faculty](https://drift.energy/press-release/blog-post-title-one-ejmdp) to plot routes around the Atlantic with the best winds. The algorithm also uses weather forecasts and sea conditions to adjust the course in real-time.

Overall, Drift envisions a fleet of hydrogen-generating sailing ships using advanced weather routing to maximize efficiency, delivering green hydrogen to ports around the world.

Drift claims that its technology provides multiple advantages over existing classes of renewable energy; that it is viable in more places; produces more power, more of the time; is simpler to maintain, and may be up to 10x quicker to implement.

Whether the concept will prove to be practical remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the scope of the project vision is indeed impressive.
