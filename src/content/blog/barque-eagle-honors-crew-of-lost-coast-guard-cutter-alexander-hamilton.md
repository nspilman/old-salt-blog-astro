US Coast Guard Cutter Alexander Hamilton

The US  [Coast Guard Barque *Eagle*](http://www.uscg.mil/datasheet/wixtrain.asp) stopped on her way home from her cruise of European ports to honor the memory of the crew of the [Coast Guard Cutter *Alexander Hamilton*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Alexander_Hamilton_\(WPG-34\)), [sunk by German submarine U-132 off Iceland in 1942](http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/Hamiltonsinking.asp).  On Friday, the *Eagle*‘s crew laid a wreath  in Faxe Bay near the site of the wreck to commemorate the loss of 32 men who died in the attack.  The *Alexander Hamilton* was the first US Coast Guard vessel lost in World War II.

*The cadets and crew of the Eagle will pause in Faxe Bay, off the coast of Iceland, at the final resting place of the Coast Guard Cutter Alexander Hamilton and will lay a wreath in honor of the fallen crewmembers. Additionally, seven flowers will be cast to sea as a tribute from the still-living crewmembers of the Coast Guard Cutter Tampa and the other 327’ “Secretary Class” cutters who served during World War II.*
