MF Hydra

Two new ferries, powered by hydrogen fuel cells, have or will soon enter service. In Norway, the [MF *Hydra*, the first liquid hydrogen fuel cell powered ferry](https://www.norled.no/en/news/the-mf-hydra-first-in-the-world/) entered regular service at the end of March. MF *Hydra* sails on the triangular route between Hjelmeland-Skipavik-Nesvik in Norway.

The 82.4-meter-long (270′) MF *Hydra* can carry up to 300 passengers and 80 vehicles. It has a speed of 9 knots powered by its two 200 kW fuel cells, two 440 kW generators, and two Shottel thrusters. The ferry is equipped with an 80 cbm tank for hydrogen storage and is expected to reduce its annual carbon emissions by up to 95%.

In California, the 70-foot (21-meter), 75-passenger hydrogen fuel cell powered ferry [*Sea Change*](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/lcti-zero-emission-hydrogen-ferry-demonstration-project#:~:text=The%20Sea%20Change%20is%20a%2070%2Dfoot%20aluminum%20catamaran%2C%20designed,Marine%20shipyard%20in%20Bellingham%2C%20WA.) is expected to begin carrying passengers along San Francisco’s waterfront this summer.  The aluminum catamaran, designed by Incat Crowther, has a top speed of 15 knots and will be powered by compressed hydrogen feeding three independent 120 kW fuel cells. The *Sea Change* will have enough onboard hydrogen storage capacity for up to two days of normal operation.
