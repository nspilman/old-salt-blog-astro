In addition to hearing about the fireboat *[John J. Harvey](http://www.fireboat.org/)* which pumped water for 80 hours to aid firefighters during the Sept. 11 attacks, visitors will also be able to take a ride on the historic fireboat.

![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/11/harvey.jpg)Participants may choose to depart on the fireboat from Pier 66 Maritime (in Hudson River Park at 26th Street) at 10:30 a.m. and share the story at *Lilac* after, or read the story at *Lilac* first and board the fireboat there for a trip out to the Harbor and back leaving at 12:00 noon and returning at 1:00 PM. The first reading of the storybook will be at 11:30 and the second is at 12:30 on the buoy deck at *Lilac*.

Reservations are required for the boat rides since space is limited and there is a $10 refundable fee per person that is forfeit if you do not take the ride. A third fireboat ride has been added at 1:30. No advance registration is needed for the reading.
