![J0B (1)](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/J0B-1.jpg)Every year in the village of [Taiji, Japan there is a yearly hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiji_dolphin_drive_hunt) which results in the slaughter of over a thousand dolphins.  Despite international protest including a 2009 documentary film, the [Cove,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cove_\(film\)) which graphically displayed the mass dolphin killing, and won an Academy Award as best Best Documentary Feature in 2010, the yearly slaughter continues.  Now approach is being tried. A petition is circulating addressed to Jacques Rogge and the International Olympic Committee requesting that Japan’s Tokyo 2020 Olympic bid not be considered until the Japanese government agrees to end the brutal Taiji dolphin drive hunt and makes it illegal to hunt dolphins in Japan. Click the link below to learn more and to sign the petition. It costs nothing and may do considerable good.   Thanks to Scott Powell for passing the word along.
