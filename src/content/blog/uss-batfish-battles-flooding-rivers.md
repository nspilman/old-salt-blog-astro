![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ussbatfish.jpg)[USS *Batfish*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Batfish_\(SS-310\)) is a Balao-class submarine, known primarily for the remarkable feat of sinking three Imperial Japanese Navy submarines in a 76-hour period, in February 1945. Since 1973, USS *Batfish* has served as an unlikely museum ship hauled up on shire at the [Muskogee War Memorial Park](https://warmemorialpark.org/) in Muskogee, OK, near the confluence of the Arkansas River, Grand River, and Verdigris Rivers.  Now with the rivers at historic flood levels, the World War II era submarine is afloat on the flood water, as volunteers scramble to keep the old sub from sinking or being overwhelmed by the swirling torrents.

[The USS Batfish survived seven war patrols during WWII but it might not survive its latest battle with Mother Nature.](https://www.abc10.com/video/weather/accuweather/world-war-ii-submarine-sinking-in-historic-flooding/607-a05c067c-8cdd-4e3c-9d63-ab2fb4615c5c)
