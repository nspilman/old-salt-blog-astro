![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/USS-COD-CEREMONY.jpg)In July 1945, the [Dutch submarine O-19](http://www.dutchsubmarines.com/specials/special_fatalpatrolo19.htm) ran hard aground on Ladd Reef in the South China Sea deep in enemy waters.  The Gato class submarine [USS *Cod*](http://www.usscod.org/info.html) was sent to rescue the Dutch sub. After  two days of attempting to free the stricken sub, the Dutch crew of 56 was taken aboard the USS *Cod* and the the O-19 was destroyed with torpedoes and fire from the *Cod*‘s deck guns to prevent it from falling into Japanese hands.

Yesterday in Cleveland, Ohio, the USS *Cod*‘s deck guns were fired again to commemorate the anniversary of the only international submarine-to-submarine rescue in history.

*On Saturday, a reenactment of the rescue and ceremonial firing of the Cods five inch gun was held with Dutch-Americans and the public. The last Captain of the USS Cod, Captain Joseph Adelman received the Dutch flag to commemorate the rescue.*  

*The USS Cod, now a museum that opens for tours, is docked on Lake Erie between Burke Airport and the Coast Guard Station.*

Here is a remarkable video of the rescue of the O-19’s crew and the firing on the Dutch sub by the USS *Cod.* Thanks for Phil Leon for passing along both the article and the video.
