Here is a [wonderful video of a 26′ long pyrosome](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/02/giant-sea-worm-pyrosome-sighted-new-zealand/), a translucent worm-like creature, videoed off the coast of New Zealand. [Pyrosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrosome), which can grow up to 30′ long are, of course, are not actually worms. They are not even single animals but a colony of hundreds or thousands of individual organisms called zooids. Each zooid is a few millimeters in size but is embedded in a common gelatinous tunic that joins all of the individuals.

Pyrosomes are bioluminescent, capable of creating rippling light shows of flashing pale blue-green light. Their bioluminescence gives them their name, pyrosoma, from the Greek (pyro = “fire”, soma = “body”).

Not all pyrosomes are as large or as lovely as the one in the video. As [we posted in 2017](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/11/invasion-sea-pickles-pyrosome-bloom-north-pacific/), a bloom of pyrosomes, averaging about 2′ long, nicknamed sea pickles, raised havoc in the Pacific Northwest, filling fishing nets, clogging hooks and washing up on beaches.
