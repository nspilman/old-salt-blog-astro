![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/06/apl_logo_135.gif)Traditionally, ships in port use auxiliary generators to power shipboard electrical systems.   APL, the Singapore based container lines, is now going “cold-iron,” shutting down the  auxiliary  generators  on their ships docking when calling on Oakland, California and using shore power instead to meet the their electrical needs.  They expect  to reduce emissions by 50,000 pounds of nitrogen oxides and 1,5000 pounds of particulates from its ships annually in Oakland.   The State of California has mandated cold-ironing for container ships by 2014.   APL is several years ahead of schedule.
