![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nasaice.jpg)The latest observations from the US National Snow & Ice Data Center in Boulder, say that the extent of [global sea is now as low](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2118093-global-sea-ice-is-at-lowest-level-ever-recorded/) as it has been since satellite monitoring began in the 1970s.  It is also likely that it is as low as is has been in several thousand years. Likewise, [global temperatures set a new record in 2016](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/18/u-s-scientists-officially-declare-2016-the-hottest-year-on-record-that-makes-three-in-a-row/?utm_term=.104ffdf44cc5), after also setting records in 2015, and 2014. This is the first time in recorded history that three temperature records have been set in three consecutive years.

Why does the melting sea ice matter? The melting ice itself does not impact sea levels, but it does increase warming by reducing the reflection of sunlight off the ice itself. Also, the ice sheets tend to hold back or slow glaciers, whose calving does increase sea levels.  Earlier this month [we posted about the imminent collapse of part of the Larsen C ice sheet](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/01/antarctics-larsen-ice-shelf-on-the-verge-of-collapse/#more-45209) in Antarctica. BBC reports “if all the ice that the Larsen C shelf currently holds back entered the sea, global waters would rise by 10cm (4 inches).”
