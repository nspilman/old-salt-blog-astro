![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JoyRD.jpg)Since at least 2007, a variety of large inflatable rubber ducks have been showing up in harbors around the world. Most recently, a 25-foot high inflatable rubber duck appeared mysteriously in Belfast harbor in Maine. The word “JOY” was emblazoned on across its breast. The Belfast Harbor Master Katherine Given told the [Bangor Daily News](https://bangordailynews.com/2021/08/16/news/midcoast/giant-rubber-ducky-appears-in-belfast-harbor-charms-the-city/), “Everybody loves it, I have no idea who owns it, but it kind of fits Belfast. A lot of people want to keep it here.”

  A few days later, however, it was gone again, although there have been sightings in nearby Islesboro. Given says she received an anonymous letter from someone claiming to be responsible — and they hinted that it may land somewhere else.

The [most well-known rubber ducks](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/06/spreading-joy-around-the-world-aka-rubber-duck-inflated-deflated-revived-censored/) were the creations of the Dutch artist [Florentijn Hofman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentijn_Hofman). Te inflatable duck sculptures are entitled “Spreading Joy Around the World,” but are best known simply as “Rubber Duck.”  By 2013, the ducks had visited 26 cities in 14 different countries.

Each of Hofman’s ducks was created new at each harbor. They averaged about 50 feet tall and weighed about one long ton. His largest rubber duck, in Saint-Nazaire, France, had a width, length, and height of 26 by 20 by 32 meters (85 ft × 66 ft × 105 ft) respectively.

The Belfast duck is less than half the size of Hofman’s ducks, although the word “Joy” suggests a link, albeit foreshortened, with the originals’ name, “Spreading Joy Around the World.” In these times, a bit of unexpected joy in any size and shape can not do any harm.
