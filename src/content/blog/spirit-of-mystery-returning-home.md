![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2009/03/mystery-150x186.jpg)A year ago we posted about the “[Voyage of the*Spirit of Mystery*,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/03/04/voyage-of-the-spirit-of-mystery/)”  the recreation of an epic voyage by seven Cornishmen, several of whom had never been out of sight of land, who set sail in 1854 bound for the gold fields of Australia in *Mystery*, a 37′ Mounts Bay Lugger.  Adventurer Pete Goss and his crew built and sailed the *Spirit of Mystery*, a Mounts Bay Lugger modeled after the original Mystery, to Australia to commemorate the original voyage, arriving in Melbourne almost exactly a year ago.    Now the Spirit of Mystery will be returning home to Cornwall, though on this leg of the trip she will be traveling as cargo on a larger ship, at least as far as Holland.  Thanks to Tom Russel on the Linked in [Tall Ship & Traditional Sail Professionals](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2041742) group for the reference.
