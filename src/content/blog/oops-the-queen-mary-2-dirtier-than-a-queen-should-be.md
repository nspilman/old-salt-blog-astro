*Failing grades for ships, especially the larger vessels, are extremely rare, according to [CruiseCritic.com](http://www.cruisecritic.com/news/news.cfm?ID=4531). There have been no failing scores since Albatross, a private ship, received a score of 69 in February 2010, the site reported*

*The kind of violations found on board the Queen Mary 2 are unacceptable, especially the dirty pool water, said Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor in chief of CruiseCritic.com.*

*“I’ve been chronicling the CDC scores for 14 years and this one is unusually bad,” Brown said. “What really bothered me was the use of the word ‘filthy’ five times.”*

*So should you worry if you have a cruise coming up on the Queen Mary 2? Brown said you shouldn’t have second thoughts.*

*“I’m sure after this, it’s probably the cleanest ship out there,” she said.*
