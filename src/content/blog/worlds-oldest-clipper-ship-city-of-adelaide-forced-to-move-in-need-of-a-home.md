![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/coa200.jpg)It has been a long and difficult journey for the world’s oldest surviving clipper ship, the [*City of Adelaide.*](https://www.cityofadelaide.org.au/) The ship has still not quite found a home. In 2014, the ship was rescued from likely scrapping and carried by barge from Scotland to its namesake city in South Australia. The South Australian government contributed A$850,000 to help defray some of the costs of the move. The ship, sitting on a deck barge was temporarily brought into Dock 1 in the Port of Adelaide.

The composite clipper ship was built in 1864 to carry settlers to South Australia. The ship made 23 voyages between Great Britain and Austalia. An estimated 250,000 Australians can trace their ancestry to the ship City of Adelaide.

In 2017, it was announced that a [permanent home would be created for the ship in Adelaide’s Dock 2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/04/update-new-home-worlds-oldest-clipper-ship-city-adelaide/). A new road and pedestrian walkway would be built and the area would become ac enter for historic ships and boats. A minimum of [$3 million in funding](https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/messenger/west-beaches/dock-2-in-port-adelaide-is-governments-preferred-home-for-worlds-oldest-clipper-ship-city-of-adelaide/news-story/5afe188c77b88cc6226f32dc27fe77ed) toward maintaining the vessels over the next five years was also promised.

In the last two years, nothing has happened to prepare Dock 2 for the clipper ship. The area is still a largely inaccessible, industrial wasteland. In the meantime, however, real estate development has progressed in the area around Dock 1. The clipper ship *City of Adelaide* is being kicked off the dock to make way for a 750 unit housing development. 

Right now, the only place has to go is Dock 2. 

City of Adelaide Preservation Trust director [Peter Christopher said the clipper could move to the offered site](https://classicsailor.com/2019/02/city-of-adelaide-forced-to-move/) in the long-term, “subject to a number of conditions, including a road being put in so people could find it”. “Dock 2 is virtually inaccessible,” Mr. Christopher told ABC Radio Adelaide. “It’s an industrial wasteland. Nobody could find it even if they had a map to show them there. “So if the ship were to go there in a temporary situation, it would just be lost.” 

If there is no suitable spot for the ship City of Adelaide in the city of Adelaide, [Port Augusta has also expressed interest](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-20/city-of-adelaide-clipper-left-out-of-port-development-plan/7643578) in hosting the historic ship. In the meantime, the 155-year old ship still needs a permanent home.
