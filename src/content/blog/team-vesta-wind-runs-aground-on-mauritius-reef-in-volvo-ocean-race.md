![Team-Vestas-Wind](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/11/Team-Vestas-Wind.jpg)On Leg 2 of the [Volvo Ocean Race](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/), the [Team Vesta Wind](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/teams/49_Team-Vestas-Wind.html) boat ran aground Saturday on a reef in the [Cargados Carajos archipelago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Brandon) about 430 km to the northeast of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. There are no reported injuries and the nine members of the crew are reported to have abandoned the stricken sail boat on Sunday morning.  They were rescued by local coast guard shortly after dawn.  Fellow Volvo racer,  U.S.- based [Team Alvimedica](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/photo/184_TEAM-ALVIMEDICA.html), which had been standing by to render assistance as necessary, was released to continue racing toward Abu Dhabi.

[Team Vestas Wind reports](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/news/8084_Grounded.html) that  both the rudders on the 65′ boat are broken and the stern of the boat is being beaten on rocks, with the bow pointing out to sea. The team has deployed two life rafts.  The Volvo Ocean 65 has watertight bulkheads in the bow and the stern. The remaining part of the boat is intact including the rig. Leg 2 of the Volvo Ocean Race is being sailed between Cape Town and Abu Dhabi.

Cargados Carajos, also known as Saint Brandon, measures more than 50 km from north to south, and is 5 km wide, cut by three passes. The reef area totals 190 km² yet has a total land area of only 1.3 km².
