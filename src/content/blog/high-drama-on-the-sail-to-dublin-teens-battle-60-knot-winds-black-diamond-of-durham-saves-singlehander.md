The [Dublin Tall Ship Festival](http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0824/breaking29.html) is well underway this weekend in Ireland, with 40 tall ships and at least a dozen accompanying vessels.  A million vistitors are expected to throng the docks.  There was already considerable drama prior to the arrival of the ships and boats in Dublin.  Teen crew on the three masted 30 meter schooner, *[Kapitan Borchardt](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?mmsi=261020790),* battled [60 knots winds in a storm which snapped one of the ship’s booms.](http://www.herald.ie/news/teens-battle-110kph-winds-as-tall-ship-damaged-in-storm-3206970.html)  No one was reported injured and the ship arrived safely in Dublin.  Ecuadorean navy’s tall ship, *[Guayas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Guayas_\(BE-21\))*, also reported ripped sails.

The Class C, 45 foot long, [*Black Diamond of Durham*](http://www.sailingnortheast.co.uk/our_black%20diamond.htm), also bound for Dublin, gave [essential aid to the 34 foot yacht, *Quest*,](http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/local/high-seas-drama-for-tall-ship-1-4867663) which had been rolled over in heavy seas, lost its electronics and engine, and had been drifting for three days.  The boat was being singlehanded by Chris Laycock from Yorkshire.  In high seas, the *Black Diamond*‘s skipper Calvyn Whitehand  launched a dinghy loaded with provisions and equipment including a spare battery. With the assistance from the *Black Diamond*, the engine on the *Quest* was restarted and Mr. Laycock is reported to have brought the *Quest* safely into Brest.
