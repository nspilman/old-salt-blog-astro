![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/10/ac72.jpg)Unless I am mistaken, when the Oracle Team US AC 72 sailed to victory in 2013, there was only one American citizen in the crew. The members of Emirates Team New Zealand, which needed the sponsorship of Emirates Airlines to fund the costly venture, were all sailors from New Zealand, except for two Aussies, who both had family ties in New Zealand.  So, I guess it wasn’t all that much of a surprise that the next America’s Cup in 2017 will not even be sailed in America. [For the first time in history, an American defender has chosen a foreign port to race in, specifically, Bermuda](http://online.wsj.com/articles/oracle-team-usa-picks-bermuda-for-2017-americas-cup-1416535667). So, the crew sailing the “American” boats may not be actually American and now, neither will be port where the races are held. The Oracle Team will still be funded by Larry Ellison’s greenbacks, so at least the cash behind the defense of the America’s Cup is still largely American.
