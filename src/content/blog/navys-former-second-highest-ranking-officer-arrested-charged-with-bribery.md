![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/admburke.jpg)The Department of Justice [announced yesterday](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/retired-navy-admiral-and-business-executives-arrested-bribery-scheme) the arrest of [Robert P. Burke](https://www.navy.mil/Leadership/Flag-Officer-Biographies/Search/Article/2236163/admiral-robert-burke/), a retired four-star Navy Admiral, on criminal charges in a bribery scheme that allegedly awarded a sole-source contract to a company in 2021 in exchange for a $500,000-a-year job and stock options. Two business executives were also arrested and charged.

Adm. Burke, 62, of Coconut Creek, Fla., faces the prospect of becoming only the second U.S. admiral to be found guilty of committing a federal crime while on active duty, after his arrest on a five-count indictment returned Thursday in U.S. District Court in Washington.  
   
Burke was arrested with Yongchul “Charlie” Kim, 50, and Meghan Messenger, 47, founders of the New York-based technology services firm Next Jump, prosecutors announced.  
   
All three face counts of conspiracy to commit bribery and bribery, punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Burke faces additional counts of performing acts affecting a personal financial interest and concealing material facts, punishable by up to 30 years.

“As alleged in the indictment, Admiral Burke used his public office and his four-star status for his private gain,” said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves. “The law does not make exceptions for admirals or CEOs. … The urgency is at its greatest when, as here, senior government officials and senior executives are allegedly involved in the corruption.”

Before retiring in 2022, Burke oversaw naval operations in Europe, Russia and most of Africa. A native of Portage, Mich., Burke served from June 2019 until June 2020 as the 40th vice chief of naval operations, the service’s No. 2-ranking officer. He succeeded retired [Adm. William Moran](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/07/politics/admiral-navy-top-officer-retires/index.html), who was set to take over as the Navy’s top officer in August 2019 before unexpectedly retiring, citing his interactions with a subordinate accused of acting inappropriately toward female officers, reports the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/05/31/retired-four-star-navy-admiral-arrested-bribery/).

Burke is a trained electrical engineer and submariner who served in numerous postings around the world. He was chief of naval personnel, with responsibility for manpower, personnel, training, and education, when the events described in the indictment began.

Only one U.S. Navy admiral has ever been found guilty of committing a federal crime while on active duty; [Rear Adm. Robert Gilbeau was sentenced to 18 months in prison](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/former-admiral-sentenced-to-18-months-in-fat-leonard-case/2017/05/17/1a11869c-3b06-11e7-a058-ddbb23c75d82_story.html) in 2017 for lying to federal agents about his part in the [worst corruption scandal in Navy history](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/08/fat-leonard-scandal-rolls-two-naval-officers-plead-guilty-two-execs-sentenced/), involving disgraced defense contractor Leonard “Fat Leonard” Francis.
