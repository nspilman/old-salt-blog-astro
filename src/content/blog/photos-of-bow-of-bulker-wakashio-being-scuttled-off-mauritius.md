The [government of Mauritius announced](https://www.facebook.com/MobilisationNationaleWakashio/posts/651877708789222) last Monday that “the planned sinking of the stem (forward) section of the \[[bulk carrier *Wakashio*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/WAKASHIO-IMO-9337119-MMSI-372711000)\] has been completed and at around 3.30pm was no longer visible on the sea surface. While some sources referred to the location of the scuttling as a “[mystery](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishandegnarain/2020/08/25/dramatic-photos-show-wakashio-being-deliberately-sunk-as-mystery-continues-over-final-location/#6be4f5063bea)” in that no coordinates were provided in the government press release, [video clips of the sinking](https://youtu.be/dFv4sTZT_tM) gave the location as 20°22’57.183″S, 58°01’07.415″E, or roughly 14 nautical miles off the Mauritius coast in deep water.

The Capesize bulk carrier *Wakashio*, while traveling in ballast, r[an aground on a reef on the island of Mauritius on July 25](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/08/capesize-bulker-mv-wakashio-aground-on-mauritius-reef-may-break-up/). After 13 days on the reef, she began leaking fuel oil from her tanks. In total, the ship is believed to have leaked 1,000 tonnes of heavy oil into the pristine waters off Pointe d’Esny, near the marine park of Blue Bay. The [ship broke in two on August 15](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/08/update-mv-wakashio-ship-breaks-up-cleanup-continues-bow-under-tow-captain-arrested/), breaking one hatch forward of the deckhouse. 

The bow of the ship was taken under tow and moved away from the reef to a location in deep water where the it was scuttled.  The stern of the ship, including the deckhouse, remains lodged on the reef.
