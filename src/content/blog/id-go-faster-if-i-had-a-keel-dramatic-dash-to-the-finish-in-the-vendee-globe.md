Three days ago, the articulating keel on his boat broke off and since then he has been relying on water ballast for stability.  On a recent video broadcast he commented, [‘I’d go faster if I had a keel.’](http://afloat.ie/sail/events/vendee-globe/item/20756-id-go-faster-if-i-had-a-keel-vendee-globes-dick-is-carrying-on-keel-less)   [Alex Thomson sailing *Hugo Black* in fourth place is standing by](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/news/article/11119/a-noble-gesture.html) to assist Dick is necessary.
