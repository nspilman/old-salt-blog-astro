![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vikingbanner.jpg)[Viking Cruises](https://www.vikingcruises.com/) announced that it is suspending operations of all ocean and river cruises until May 1. Viking operates over 70 river and cruise vessels, including 16 ocean-going cruise ships. A short time later, Princess Cruises announced that it was stopping the operation of all 18 of its ships until May 11. Princess ships currently at sea will sail to their final destination or divert to an alternate port prior to March 17th.

[Three Britons tested positive](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8104129/Viking-Cruises-suspend-ocean-river-trips-citing-significant-risks-caused-coronavirus.html) on a Viking vessel in Cambodia this week. Viking chairman Torstein Hagen announced the suspension of operations in a [video](https://www.vikingcruises.com/notice/update-video.html?_ga=2.242467147.854796189.1584031356-974338194.1584031356) saying, “I am sure you recognize that COVID-19 has made travel extremely complicated. An increasing number of ports — including Venice, Monte Carlo, and Bergen — have temporarily closed to cruise ships. Major attractions such as the Vatican and other museums have been closed, and some countries are imposing restrictions on public gatherings and visitors.”

Two Princess cruise ships, the *Diamond Princess* and the *Grand Princess* have been coronavirus hotspots. The *Diamond Princess* had 700 passengers and crew infected with coronavirus in February, while the *Grand Princess* had 21 passengers and crew test positive for the virus earlier this month. 

Princess is a subsidiary of [Carnival Corp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_Corporation_%26_plc). which owns over 100 ships across 10 brands. So far, operations across the rest of the Carnival fleet continue. [Carnival shares](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/business/cruise-lines-princess-and-viking-suspend-operations-coronavirus/index.html) ([CCL](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CCL&source=story_quote_link)), plunged 15% in early trading on the news. Shares were already down 57% so far this year through Wednesday’s close.
