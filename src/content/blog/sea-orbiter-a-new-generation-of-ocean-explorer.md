The [Sea Orbiter](http://www.seaorbiter.com/accueil) concept design looks like something straight out of science fiction.  Floating half above and half below the surface of the water, it appears to be more like a scimitar-shaped inter-galactic spaceship than any sort of  oceanographic research vessel. Fifty eight meters high, it will drift on the ocean currents as a largely self-sustaining ocean-going laboratory.  The concept of French architect Jacques Rougerie,  the design has been under development for the past 12 years and construction is planned to begin this October.
