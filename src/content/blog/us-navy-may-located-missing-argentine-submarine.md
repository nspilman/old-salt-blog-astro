![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/arasanjuan1.jpg)A [US Navy plane may have located the position](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/new-signal-sparks-fresh-hope-11564133) of the Argentine Navy submarine [ARA *San Juan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_San_Juan) which has been [missing since last Wednesday](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/11/argentines-search-missing-submarine-ara-san-juan/). Sensors aboard the plane detected a ‘heat stain’ at 230 ft below the surface, roughly 185 miles off the east coast of Argentina. A rescue vessel involved in the search also picked up a sonar signal late Tuesday night.

Time is running out for the 44 crew members on the submarine, which reportedly has a seven day supply of oxygen.  If the submarine sank or was disabled a week ago, the oxygen supply could be very close to being exhausted.
