Here is a wonderful short video of the stepping of the mast of the [tall ship *Providence*](https://tallshipprovidence.org/) in Wiscasset, Maine. The 110′ 12-gun sloop-of-war is a replica of the first warship in the Continental Navy, originally chartered by the Rhode Island General Assembly as *Katy* in 1775. The modern replica is nearing the completion of an extensive restoration and will be sailing this summer to a [new home in Alexandria, VA](https://www.visitalexandriava.com/listings/tall-ship-providence/8640/).
