Just like this, but not so sinkable

On the heels of the centennial of the sinking of the *Titanic*, Australian mining billionaire Clive Palmer has announced his plans to build a 21st-century replica of the *Titanic* and sail it from England to New York accompanied by the Chinese navy by the end of 2016.  And this time, the ship will be unsinkable.  Palmer is quoted as saying, “*It is going to be designed so it won’t sink…  It will be designed as a modern ship with all the technology to ensure that doesn’t happen*.”  Like the *Costa Concordia*, perhaps?   I am struck by how similar Palmer’s statement is to the [White Star brochure describing the original *Titanic*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/14/myths-of-the-titanic-did-white-star-line-claim-the-ship-was-unsinkable/) and her sister ship the *Olympic.  “… *these two wonderful vessels are designed to be unsinkable.*”*  

Palmer’s ship, if built, will not be the first Titanic II.  See our previous post: [The Name Should Have been a Hint – Titanic II Sinks on Maiden Voyage](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/17/the-name-should-have-been-a-hint-titanic-ii-sinks-on-maiden-voyaage/).

*Palmer said his new shipping company, Blue Star Line Pty Ltd, had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese state-owned company CSC Jinling Shipyard to build Titanic II. The original ship was operated by the White Star Line.*

*The design work had started for the new Titanic, which will have the same dimension as its old version with 840 rooms and nine decks.*
