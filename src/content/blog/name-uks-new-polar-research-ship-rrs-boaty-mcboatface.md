![Nameboat](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Nameboat.jpg)The [British Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) is asking for suggestions](https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/news-story-suggest-a-name-for-new-polar-ship/#) for a name for the new polar research ship, currently under construction at Cammell Laird’s yard in Birkenhead.  The closing date for entries is 16th April 2016.

They have gotten quite a response. As of this morning if you attempt to submit [your suggestion online](https://nameourship.nerc.ac.uk/), you are sent to a page which reads: “***NAME YOUR SHIP IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A HIGH VOLUME OF TRAFFIC** — Our website is currently experiencing an extremely high volume of traffic. Sorry for any inconvenience caused. This team of penguins are doing their best to fix the problem! Please try again later.*”

Nevertheless, many have gotten through and have offered their suggested names. According to an article by the [Irish Examiner](http://www.irishexaminer.com/examviral/science-world/is-this-the-best-ever-name-for-a-ship-rrs-boaty-mcboatface-is-leading-the-vote-as-public-name-new-polar-vessel-388444.html), the currently most popular name is *RRS Boaty McBoatface*. RRS *Henry Worsley*, RRS *David Attenborough and RRS Pillar of Autumn* are also ranking name suggestions. *Somewhat further down the list are RRS Usain Boat, RRS Ice Ice Baby and RRS Boatimus Prime.*

The new ship, whatever it ultimately is named, will replace the existing RRS *James Clark Ross* and RRS *Ernest Shackleton*, which work in the Arctic and Antarctic.

The boat will be 128 metres long and weigh around 15,000 tonnes, and up to 90 scientists and support staff could live on board.

The £200m vessel is due to be operational in 2019.
