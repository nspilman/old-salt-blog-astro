![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/02/anat-icon.jpg)In January we posted about the [Jewel of Muscat](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/01/12/the-jewel-of-muscat-makes-ready-for-epic-journey/) a replica of a 9th-century sailing ship modelled on a famous Tang Treasure ship.  Recently Nova broadcast a documentary on far older ships from the region, [Pharaoh Hatshepsut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsut)’s ships, dating from 1479 BCE.   [Pharaoh Hatshepsut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsut) was the only female pharoah and she is said to have launched a fabled expedition on great trading ships to a far-away land known as Punt.  The expedition is recorded in bas relief on her  funeral temple.  A team of archeologists and Egyptian boat builders have built a replica of one of these ships and sailed it in the open waters of the Red Sea.   It is a fascinating documentary.
