The [RV *Petrel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Petrel) has located the wreckage of the [Japanese aircraft carrier *Akagi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Akagi), sunk in the [Battle of Midway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway) in June 1942. The ship is the second of two sunken Japanese carriers that the *Petrel* has located two days apart. They had previously located the [carrier *Kaga*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/10/paul-allens-rv-petrel-locates-wreck-of-wwii-japanese-carrier-kaga/). The *Akagi* and the *Kaga* were two of four large carriers sunk in the battle, which was considered a turning point in the Pacific conflict in WWII.  Both carriers had participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.   

The *Akag*i was found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, sitting upright in a debris field, in nearly 18,000 feet of water, or almost 3 nautical miles deep, more than 1,300 miles northwest of Pearl Harbor.
