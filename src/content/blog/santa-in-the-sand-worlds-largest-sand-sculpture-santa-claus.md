In 2008, sand artist [Sudarsan Pattnaik](http://www.sandindia.com/theartist.html) and his team created a sand sculpture of Santa Claus at Puri beach on India’s East Coast, measuring 100 feet long, 30 feet wide and 15 feet high. The sculpture used 1,000 tones of sand and holds the title as the [Tallest sand sculpture of Santa Claus](http://www.worldrecordsacademy.org/arts/tallest_sand_sculpture_of_Santa_Claus-world_record-set_by_Sudarsan_Patnaik_80474.htm).

The next year Sudarshan Patnaik sculpted 100 Santa Claus figures on the beach at Puri to spread awareness about global warming.
