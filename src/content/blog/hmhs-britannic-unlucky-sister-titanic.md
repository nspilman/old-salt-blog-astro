HMHS Britannic

[*Titanic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) had two sisters — the [*Olympic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Olympic) and the [*Britannic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMHS_Britannic#/media/File:HMHS_Britannic.jpg). While the *Olympic* had a productive 24 year operating life, the *Britannic* was only slightly more lucky than her ill-fated sister*,* *Titanic.* Just over 100 years ago, on November 21, 1916, His Majesty’s Hospital Ship (HMHS) *Britannic* sank after hitting a German mine on the morning of November 21, 1916, off the Greek island of Kea in the Adriatic. Unlike the *Titanic,* which sank with the loss of more than 1500 in 1911, only 30 on the *Britannic* perished. Of the 1,065 people on board; 1,035 survivors were rescued from the water and lifeboats.

The *Britannic* was the third of the White Star Line’s *Olympic* class of luxury liners. She was delivered in 1915, just before the start of World War I.  Rather than be put into trans-Atlantic service, she was initially laid up and then put into service as a hospital ship in late 1915. She was described as “[the most beautiful hospital ship that ever sailed the seas.](http://www.hospitalshipbritannic.com/)” In less than a year, she would be at the bottom of the Adriatic. The *Britannic* was the largest British ship lost during World War I and remains the largest sunken ocean liner in the world.

The wreck of HMHS *Britannic* was first discovered and explored in about 400 feet by [Jacques Cousteau in 1975](http://hmhsbritannic.weebly.com/1975-6-cousteau.html). Below is a video of the ship’s history and of diving on the wreck in honor of the 100th anniversary of the sinking.
