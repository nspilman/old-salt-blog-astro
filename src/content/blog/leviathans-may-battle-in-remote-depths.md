![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/gwshark.jpg)A fascinating new study reported in the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-shark7-2010mar07,0,5015116.story) suggests that we know far less about the great white shark than we may have thought.

*New studies suggest that great white sharks may migrate so they can dine on giant squids.*

*In what could be the ultimate marine smack-down, great white sharks off the California coast may be migrating 1,600 miles west to do battle with creatures that rival their star power: giant squids.*

*A series of studies tracking this mysterious migration has scientists rethinking not just what the big shark does with its time but also what sort of creature it is.*

*For more reserved scientists, the possible link between sharks and squid, suggested by marine ecologist Michael Domeier of the Marine Conservation Science Institute in Fallbrook, is just one part of emerging research that has altered their understanding of the great whites.*

*The shift began eight years ago with the surprising discovery that great white sharks migrate, somewhat as humpback whales do. That and subsequent studies have demolished the iconic image of great whites lurking in relative shallows, ready to snatch an errant swimmer, as popularized in the movie “Jaws.”*

*Domeier said he believes the animals “are not a coastal shark that comes out to the middle of the ocean. They are an ocean shark that comes to the coast. It is a complete flip-flop.”*
