“*Captains, Pirates and Ghosts*,” from the documentary series, [Secrets of New York](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/media/shows/secrets-of-new-york.page), hosted  by Kelly Choi.  It includes some nice shots of the [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/)‘s schooner *Pioneer*, with commentary by the museum’s Executive Director, Captain Johnathon Boulware.  Segments from the [Bridge Cafe](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/04/from-the-hole-in-the-wall-to-the-bridge-cafe-from-gallus-mag-to-hurricane-sandy/), were shot before Hurricane Sandy. The historic bar and restaurant were severely damaged by flooding. The restaurant has not reopened. Scenes from South and Water Streets, including Kit Burn’s Rat pit, shown in this episode are also featured in my novel, *[The Shantyman](http://www.amazon.com/Shantyman-Rick-Spilman-ebook/dp/B00T57OQYA/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)*.
