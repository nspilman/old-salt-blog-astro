Approximately a dozen other firefighters were reported to be injured.

The fire broke out around 9:30 p.m. The fire started on the 10th deck as crew members and local stevedores were moving cars, vans and trucks. Upon arrival, firefighters located the fire, which broke out in five to seven cars and spread to the 11th and 12th decks of the ship.

At 6:45 a.m. Thursday, the fire was still burning and a fireboat was spraying water on the ship as smoke poured from the blaze.

The *Grande Costa D’Avorio* was built in 2011 and is owned by the Grimaldi Group.

The [Grimaldi Group](https://www.grimaldi.napoli.it/en/index.html) released a statement saying, “The Italian-flag vessel was completing the loading operations of various rolling units (cars, vans, trucks) when the fire started at deck n 10 which was attended by local stevedores and crew members. The crew of the vessel immediately activated the on-board fire suppression procedures while the local firefighting service were alerted, and their prompt response played a crucial role in containing and bringing the fire under control. Sadly, during the firefighting operations, Grimaldi Deep Sea were informed that two firefighters lost their lives. All Company’s thoughts, prayers and sympathies are with their families and team currently. At this time, it is not known how the fire started but the Company will undertake a full investigation in close cooperation with all relevant authorities.”
