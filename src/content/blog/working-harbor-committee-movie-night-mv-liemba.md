![liemba](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/liemba.jpg)If you happen to be near New York City next Tuesday night, March 31st, be sure to stop by the Community Church to “take an epic journey down the longest lake in the world on Africa’s last surviving steamship…. the *MV Liemba,*” and all without leaving midtown Manhattan.

The [Working Harbor Committee](http://workingharbor.com/) is sponsoring the showing of a wonderful documentary on the *MV Liemba,* an ex-German warship, a minor movie star, and also, at one hundred years old, the world’s oldest passenger ferry in service. The venerable ship provides a critical link to the isolated ports along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. (See our post from last November, *[MV Liemba — the World’s Oldest Passenger/Cargo Steamer at 100 .](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/11/mv-liemba-the-worlds-oldest-passengercargo-steamer-at-100/))*  A trailer for the documentary appears below the page break.

From their announcement:  
*Before there was the African Queen, before there was the East River Ferry and the NYC Ferry plan, there was Liemba! A ferry connecting communities and people with work on the great Lake Tanganyika. Come see this warming and entertaining documentary about the 100 year old vessel; its history, interviews with the people who run and use it; and hear the marvelous sound track of East Africa music.*
