Tudor Vladimirescu,

We recently posted, “[Which is the Oldest Operating Steamship?](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/11/oldest-operating-steamship/)” We thought that “the oldest steamer may be the [Norwegian PS *Skibladner*,](https://www.skibladner.no/about-us/facts-about-skibladner) which began service in August 1856 on Lake Mjøsa. We also asked, “So, which vessels have we missed? Any older steamships still in service?” We got some very interesting responses.

### The Oldest of the Oldest?

William Worden pointed out that “Romania’s [*Tudor Vladimirescu*](http://www.towingline.com/archives/380), stationed at Galati, is older than *Skibladner* by two years, having been built in Hungary as a Danube towboat and later converted to passenger service. Her oscillating engine was originally a two-cylinder simple, but was later converted to a compound. She has received a new superstructure at least three times, the most recent being ultra-modern. She does not regularly operate; nonetheless, it does appear that she is the oldest operable steamer in the world.”

The paddle steamer *Tudor Vladimirescu,* was built in Budapest in 1854 as the tug *Croatia.*  Later named *Grigore Manu*, and *Sarmisegetuza,* she does appear to be the oldest operating steamer.  This takes nothing away from *PS Skibladner,* which is billed as the “world’s oldest preserved paddle steamer in timetabled service.” The [Towlines.com blog](http://www.towingline.com/archives/380) has a great summary of the *Tudor Vladimirescu’s* history along with information about her steam plant.

### Honorable Mention

Charles Payton and Roger Marsh mentioned the 1861 built steam tug *Mayflower* of Bristol. While not necessarily, the oldest, she is interesting for having a very [early screw propeller](http://www.ukmcs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/11/Marine-Engineering-Collections-Mapping-Document.pdf) of cast iron with bolted on blades. She was in service until 1964 and is now a [museum ship](http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/register/45/mayflower).

Captain D. Peter Boucher, Kt. SMOM, also suggested “another interesting collection of active paddle steamers are those of the Swiss lakes. Ranging in age from 1895 to 1927 they are a wonderful way to see the towns and villages around the various lakes. Those of the Vierwaldstattersee (Lake Lucerne), which sail all year round, I have sailed in them several times and they handle beautifully under side paddles.”

[Schifffahrtsgesellschaft des Vierwaldstättersees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schifffahrtsgesellschaft_des_Vierwaldst%C3%A4ttersees) (SGV) operates a fleet of 21 passenger ships, including five historical paddle steamers and 16 motor vessels of various ages and sizes.  SGV’s flagship is the paddle steamer *Stadt Luzern.*  The oldest of these steamers date from shortly after the turn of the 20th century. The [PS *Uri*](http://www.paddlesteamers.info/Uri.htm), built in 1901, and the [PS *Unterwalden*](http://www.paddlesteamers.info/Unterwalden.htm), built in 1902, are both still in service on Lake Luzerne.  

Thanks to everyone for all the comments and suggestions.
