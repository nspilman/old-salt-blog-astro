![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/seasnotturkey.jpg)A thick, slimy layer of so-called “sea snot” has spread in Turkey’s [Sea of Marmara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Marmara) to the south of Istanbul, posing a threat to marine life and the fishing industry. 

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/sea-snot-outbreak-off-turkish-coast-poses-threat-marine-life-2021-06-01/) reports that scientists say climate change and pollution have contributed to the proliferation of the organic matter, also known as marine mucilage, which contains a wide variety of microorganisms and can flourish when nutrient-rich sewage flows into seawater.

Drone footage shot over the Sea of Marmara shows ferries and cargo ships criss-crossing harbors and seawater blanketed with the viscous, greyish substance that can suffocate marine life.

Turkey has vowed to save the Sea of Marmara by launching a disaster management programme meant to clean up a slimy “sea snot” outbreak threatening marine life and the fishing industry.

Environment Minister Murat Kurum said 25 sea surface-cleaning and barrier-laying boats, as well as 18 other vessels, were working to prevent the spread of the mucilage. Illegal fishing and “ghost” nets would be halted and Turkey would declare Marmara a protected area by the end of 2021, he said.

“We are starting our cleaning efforts both on land and at sea at 15 points today,” Kurum said. “We are determined to save the Marmara and we will save it.”
