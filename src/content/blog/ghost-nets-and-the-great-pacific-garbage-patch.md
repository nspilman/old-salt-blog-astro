A new study published in [*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w) suggests that the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://www.theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/) is growing “exponentially” and now spans roughly 617,763 square miles (1.6 million square km), or about three times the size of France. The garbage patch is an accumulation of plastic and floating debris brought together by a gyre, a circular current, in the Pacific between California and Hawaii. It is thought to be the largest ocean garbage patch on earth. According to the [new study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w), the trash is made up of 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic weighing nearly 90,000 tons. This new estimate is between four and sixteen times greater than had previously been predicted.

One aspect of the study that appears to have drawn less attention than the size and the extent of the patch is what it is made of. The study determined that at least 46% of the floating debris are fishing nets and related cordage. These “[ghost nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_net)” are a major threat to fish populations around the world and pose an entirely different set of challenges in any potential cleanup.

The problem of ghost nets may be significantly larger than even the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The conservation group [World Animal Protection](https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/) estimates that around [640,000 tonnes of so-called ‘ghost gear’](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-05/ghost-fishing-nets-killing-marine-animals/8591020) is left in oceans each year. This ghost gear continues to [catch and kill fish and animals](http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/ghost_fishing_nets_invisible_killers_in_the_oceans/) as large as whales. The [International Whaling Commission estimates that 308,000 whales and dolphins die annually](https://iwc.int/entanglement) due to entanglement in fishing gear, and more still in marine debris.
