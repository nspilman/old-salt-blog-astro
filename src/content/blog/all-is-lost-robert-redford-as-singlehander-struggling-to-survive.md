Every time I read about a major casualty on a container ship, I think about the containers lost over the side, many of which continue to float, hazards to navigation to any boat about their size. All the evidence suggests that the Irish sail training vessel, [*Asgard II*, sank in the Bay of Biscay in 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asgard_II#cite_note-Times2-8) after striking a semi-submerged container.

In what looks like a truly remarkable movie, [*All is Lost*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2017038/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), Robert Redford portrays a single handed sailor whose 39-foot sail boat is struck by a floating shipping container while 1,700 miles off Sumatra. The unnamed singlehander performs what repairs he can before being overwhelmed by a storm. The 107 minute long movie has essentially no dialog and only one cast member, Redford.  When the movie was screened at the Cannes Film Festival, [Redford received a standing ovation](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22641284) for his performance.  The trailer is absolutely gripping. *All is Lost* is due to be released in October.
