Searchers using side scanning sonar believe that they may have located a German U-boat from World War II on the bottom in the [Churchill River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_River_\(Atlantic\)) not far from [Muskrat Falls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskrat_Falls)  in Labrador, Canada, more than 100 kilometres from the ocean.   German submarines operated in the region during World War II and a novel written in the early 1990s features the story of a U-boat beaching in the Churchill River.  The novel may be more accurate than anyone realized.

*Two years ago, searchers scoured the bottom of the Churchill River with side-scanning sonar. They were looking for three men lost over Muskrat Falls.*

When they reviewed the footage from that search, they made an unexpected discovery.

“We were looking for something completely different, not a submarine, not a U-boat — I mean, no one would ever believe that was possible,” Brian Corbin told CBC News.
