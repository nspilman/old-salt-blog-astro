The [Synchrolift](http://www.rolls-royce.com/marine/products/shiplifts/) is a wonderful invention. It is a shiplift and transfer system which according to Rolls Royce, the Synchrolift firm’s owner, is “used to increase efficiency and reduce drying-docking times at many of the world’s leading shipyards.”  [Mystic Seaport Museum](http://www.mysticseaport.org/) has a Synchrolift of its very own, the [Hays and Ros Clark Shiplift](http://www.mysticseaport.org/locations/shipyard/shiplift/), which was used yesterday to launch the whale ship, [*Charles W. Morgan*](http://www.mysticseaport.org/visit/explore/morgan/), after its five year restoration.

For all its other virtues, a Synchrolift does not make for an exciting launch. After the [*Morgan* was christened by Sarah Bullard](http://www.mysticseaport.org/news/2013/charles-w-morgan-is-launched/), Saturday, it took another twenty minutes for the shiplift to slowly lower the ship into the Mystic River.  Then again, slow and careful is probably not a bad idea when handling a 172 year old ship.

For those who missed the launching, the music, ceremony speeches and slow lowering of the mighty ship is available on-line :  [CHARLES W. MORGAN Launch](http://new.livestream.com/accounts/3758431/events/2191630)
