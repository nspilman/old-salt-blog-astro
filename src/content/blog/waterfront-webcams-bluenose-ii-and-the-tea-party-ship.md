The old expression goes “I love work. I could look at it for hours.”  The web cams at the [Lunenburg Shipyard](http://www.lunenburgfoundry.com/Lunenburg-Shipyard/LS-Home/welcome.html) give us a fine glimpse of the work being done rebuilding the *[Bluenose II](http://www.schoonerbluenose2.ca/)*.   There are actually three webcams, a [bow](http://www.novascotiawebcams.com/south-shore/bluenose-ii.html#axzz18l6SFjg7), a [stern](http://www.novascotiawebcams.com/south-shore/bluenose-ii-stern-view.html#axzz1CBA1h61Z) and an [overhead](http://www.novascotiawebcams.com/south-shore/bluenose-ii-top-view.html#axzz1CBA1h61Z) view.    Here also is also a web cam of [master shipwright Leon Poindexter’s Boston “Tea Party” ship in Gloucester](http://www.studiotek.net/teaparty.html).   Thanks to Captain Richard Bailey for passing the links along.      Click on the image below to go to the Bluenose II cams.
