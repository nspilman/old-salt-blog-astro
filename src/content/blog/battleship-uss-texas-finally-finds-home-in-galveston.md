![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/usstex1.jpg)The battleship [USS *Texas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Texas_\(BB-35\)), the oldest remaining dreadnought battleship, may finally have a permaneny home in Galveston, TX.

After decades of heglect, the venerable old ship was [drydocked in 2022](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/08/battleship-texas-scheduled-to-be-towed-to-yard-for-repairs-on-august-31-weather-permitting/) to undergo $60 million in repairs and refurbishment, which was largely completed early this year. However, the USS *Texas* still lacked a secure place to dock. Last week, the Galveston Wharves Board of Trustees finally agreed to berth the battleship at Pier 15, securing a long-term home as a museum ship for the historic warship.

In a statement on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=%20Battleship%20Texas%20Foundation), the non-profit [Battleship Texas Foundation](https://battleshiptexas.org/) stated, “We’re thrilled to have the support of the Wharves Board to bring *Texas* to Pier 15 in Galveston- just a short walk from Pier 21 and the historic Galveston Strand. *Texas*, the last ship of its kind, will promote tourism, educate future generations, and create a visitor experience worthy of her crew and legacy.”

The decision ended months of contention over where the battleship, owned by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, would be placed.

The main consideration in locating the ship at Pier 15 was safety within the Galveston Ship Channel, “which was really the driving force,” Jeff Patterson, board vice president, said after the meeting. [Online news site Chron](https://www.chron.com/gulf-coast/article/battleship-texas-pier-15-galveston-20201425.php)’s reported Patterson said that Pier 15, adjacent to the port’s fourth cruise terminal set to be completed in November, was unlikely to interfere with its future expansion plans.
