Kim Wall

The Danish police made a grim discovery in the murder of Kim Wall. On Friday, [divers discovered the severed head,](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/world/europe/kim-wall-peter-madsen-submarine.html) legs and arms of the Swedish journalist, as well as some of her clothing and a knife. The body parts were found in bags which contained pieces of metal presumably to weigh them down. The bags were located in Koge Bay, less than a mile from where Ms. Wall’s torso was located on August 21. 

[Kim Wall disappeared after going on a trip in Copenhagen harbor onboard Peter Madsen’s private submarine, UC3 Nautulis](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/08/strange-saga-uc3-nautilus-sub-sinks-inventor-held-murder/), as part of an interview. The submarine sank under mysterious circumstances and Ms. Wall disappeared. Mr. Madsen was rescued and subsequently charged with murder. Ms. Wall’s dismembered torso washed onto a nearby beach eleven days later.

Peter Madsen initially claimed that he had put Ms. Wall ashore prior to the sinking. He later [claimed that she had been killed accidentally](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/09/update-death-uc3-nautilus-madsen-claims-wall-killed-accident/) when the submarine’s hatch fell on her head. That claim is now in doubt as the recovered head, identified by dental records, showed no signs of damage to the cranium.
