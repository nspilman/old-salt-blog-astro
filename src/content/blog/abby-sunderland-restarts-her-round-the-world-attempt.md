*“Don’t start worrying, since I’m still north of the equator I won’t have to give up on the non-stop attempt. I will be re-staring from Cabo as soon as I can,” Abby wrote. “I was really upset about having to stop. I’ve hardly even started and I’m already heading in! I had finally gotten settled in, things were going somewhat smoothly and I was having fun. But I am glad that my team will be there waiting when I get in and I’ll be back out here soon, hopefully with a few less problems.”*
