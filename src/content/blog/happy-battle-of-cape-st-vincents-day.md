If by some chance you choose not celebrate St. Valentine’s Day, or you have simply reached the limit of how many hearts and flowers you can tolerate,   feel free to celebrate today as the [Battle of Cape St. Vincent](http://www.britishbattles.com/waterloo/cape-st-vincent.htm)‘s Day.   Two hundred and fourteen years ago on this day, a British fleet under [Admiral Sir John Jervis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jervis,_1st_Earl_of_St_Vincent) defeated a larger Spanish fleet under Admiral Don José de Córdoba near Cape St. Vincent, Portugal.  Nothing like black powder smoke and slaughter to clear the Valentine’s Day cobwebs.
