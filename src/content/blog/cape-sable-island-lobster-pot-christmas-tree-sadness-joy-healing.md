We have posted about [lobster pot Christmas trees](https://youtu.be/Hbjai8iOdtM) before, but this one is rather different. On Canada’s Cape Sable Island the lobster pot tree is decorated with pot buoys with the names of fishermen. Some are still going out to sea, but many of the buoys are in remembrance of fishermen lost at sea, family members who have crossed the bar and will never return to port.
