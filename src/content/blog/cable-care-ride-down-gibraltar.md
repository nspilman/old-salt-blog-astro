As someone who has been reading Georgian naval fiction since I was a teenager, I am well acquainted with [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar) and the famous Rock. I recently had the opportunity to visit the British Overseas Territory, one half of the [Pillars of Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Hercules), at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula. We arrived on the [M/Y *Harmony G*](http://www.varietycruises.com/english/variety/ship/my-harmony-g/3), a 55M passenger ship masquerading as a yacht. Here is a short video of the [cable car ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar_Cable_Car) down from Ape’s Den midway up the Rock. When we rode up, we were completely enveloped by fog. Fortunately, the fog lifted just before we boarded the cable car to ride down. The clouds still form a dark and glowering canopy but provided a nice view of the harbor and the Spanish shore on the far side of the bay.
