![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/baltic-bubbly-new.jpg)A [team of Polish divers discovered the wreck](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/25/shipwreck-champagne-sweden-poland/) of a 19th-century vessel laden with about 100 sealed bottles of champagne.  The shipwreck is in the Baltic Sea in 60 meters of water about 20 nautical miles south of the Swedish island of Öland.

“I think we have a treasure,” Tomasz Stachura, leader of the Polish diving group Baltictech, posted to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tomasz.stachura.92/posts/pfbid02ZY7LdhjrekaKGpnicR1xkJxgWxkfFyGYZ5WrN9ggsKFGK8rmk77ZHmA3qEqvwaMLl) after the team’s July 11 discovery.

Stachura, who specializes in underwater photography, said the ship was in “very good condition” and “brimming with historical treasures, including crates of champagne, baskets of mineral water and porcelain,” according to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/25/shipwreck-champagne-sweden-poland/).

After analyzing some of the items on board, the divers estimate that the ship capsized in the second half of the 19th century.

“Thanks to the shape of the stamp, and with historians’ help, we know that our shipment was produced between 1850-1867. Interestingly, the pottery factory into which the water was bottled also exists, and we are in contact with them to find out more details.”

The divers notified the Swedish regional authorities about the vessel. Extracting the bubbly from the boat could take some time, however, due to administrative restrictions, Stachura said.

“It had been lying there for 170 years, so let it lie there for one more year, and we will have time to better prepare for the operation,” he said.

As remarkable as the current cargo of champagne may be, it is not the oldest shipwreck champagne to be discovered. In 2010, [divers found 30 bottles of champagne](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/worlds-oldest-champagne-found-on-baltic-seabed/) thought to pre-date the French Revolution on the Baltic seabed. The wine – believed to have been made by Clicquot (now Veuve Clicquot) between 1782 and 1788 – was still in good condition.

In 2011, a [bottle of the Veuve Clicquot sold at auction for 30,000 euros](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/the-worlds-oldest-champagne-sells-at-auction-for-less-than-predicted/) ($43,500).
