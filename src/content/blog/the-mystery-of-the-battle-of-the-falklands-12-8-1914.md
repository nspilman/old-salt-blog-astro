HMS Invincible

Last week, [marine archeologists announced finding the wreckage](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/12/wreck-of-german-wwi-cruiser-scharnhorst-discovered-off-falklands/) of the German battlecruiser [SMS *Scharnhorst*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Scharnhorst) off the Falkland Islands. The *Scharnhorst,* along with most of the German East Asia Squadron, was sunk by the Royal Navy 105 years ago on this day, December 8, 1914, in the [Battle of the Falklands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Falkland_Islands#cite_note-21).  How and why the Battle of the Falklands came to be fought remains something of a mystery.

Toward the end of 1914, the Imperial German Navy’s East Asia Squadron, under the command of Vice-Admiral Maximilian Graf von Spee, was fighting its way home. On November 1, the German squadron has easily defeated two obsolete British cruisers killing 1,600 British seamen, off the coast of central Chile [near the city of Coronel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Coronel) Spee then refueled his ships and rounded Cape Horn. Before setting a course for Europe, however, Spee decided to attack the British supply base at Stanley in the Falkland Islands.  He believed the base was undefended. He was wrong. It would prove to be a fatal mistake. 

The East Asia Squadron was made up of two armored cruisers, SMS [*Scharnhorst*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Scharnhorst) and [*Gneisenau*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Gneisenau), the light cruisers SMS *Nürnberg*, *Dresden* and *Leipzig*, and three auxiliaries. When Spee steamed into Stanley, he discovered a larger Royal Navy squadron waiting for him. The British squadron, under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir Frederick Doveton Sturdee, consisted of the battlecruisers HMS [*Invincible*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Invincible_\(1907\)) and [*Inflexible*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Inflexible_\(1907\)), the armored cruisers HMS *Carnarvon*, *Cornwall* and *Kent*, the armed merchant cruiser HMS *Macedonia* and the light cruisers HMS *Bristol* and *Glasgow.*

Spee and the East Asia Squadron were outnumbered and outgunned. When the Germans turned to flee, they were also outrun by the faster Royal Navy ships. The battle was a rout. The Germans lost both armored cruisers, and two of the three light cruisers. Two d the auxiliaries were also captured and scuttled. Where the British had 10 killed with 19 wounded, the Germans lost 1,871 including Admiral Spee and his two sons. An additional 215 German sailors were captured.

How and why the Battle of the Falklands was fought is something of a mystery. Why did Spee choose to attack Stanley?  Why did he think that it was undefended? How did the British know when and where Spee would arrive?

After the battle, German naval experts were baffled at why Admiral Spee attacked the base and how the two squadrons could have met so coincidentally in so many thousands of miles of open waters. Kaiser William II’s handwritten note on the official report of the battle reads: “It remains a mystery what made Spee attack the Falkland Islands.

It was generally concluded that the German admiralty passed inaccurate information to Spee from the German wireless station at Valparaiso which reported the port free of Royal Navy warships. 

In 1925, a German naval officer and spy, Franz von Rintelen, interviewed Admiral William Reginald Hall, Director of the Admiralty’s Naval Intelligence Division, and was informed that Spee’s squadron had been lured towards the British battlecruisers by means of a fake signal sent in a German naval code broken by British cryptographers.

If that was the case it foreshadowed the breaking of the Japanese naval code in 1942, which contributed significantly to the American victory.  

There are many skeptics of von Rintelen’s account, however. [BritishBattles.com](https://www.britishbattles.com/first-world-war/battle-of-the-falkland-islands/) notes:  The problems with \[von Rintelen’s\] claim are numerous: Why did the Admiralty not inform Sturdee of this ruse as it could only work if his ships were in the Falklands when von Spee arrived? There was very limited direct radio communication, if any, between London and its own ships let alone with von Spee. There is no indication from the conduct of operations in the Pacific and Atlantic that the British Admiralty had access to German naval codes. It seems inconceivable that a British admiral would discuss secret naval matters with anyone, let alone a notorious German saboteur like von Rintelen, whom the British would have shot if they could have laid their hands on him.

We may never know whether Spee was lured to the Falklands by a fake coded message, inaccurate information or just poor judgment and supremely back luck.   

In 1936, the German Kriegsmarine commissioned a heavy pocket battleship, [*Admiral Graf Spee*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_cruiser_Admiral_Graf_Spee), named in honor of the admiral lost in the Battle of the Falklands. In the first naval battle of World War II, the *Admiral Graf Spee* was trapped in the River Plate by a superior British naval force and was scuttled.
