Last year, we posted about French tire manufacturer Michelin’s [Wing Sail Mobility (WISAMO) project](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/06/michelins-wing-sail-mobility-wisamo-project-features-inflatable-wing-sails/) design that features an automated, telescopic, inflatable wing sail system, which is expected to reduce fuel consumption by up to 20%.

The project is taking a major step forward as Michelin and its partners are joining with Compagnie Maritime Nantaise to install a 100 sqm inflatable wing prototype on CMN’s [8,600 DWT ro/ro MN Pelican](https://www.compagnie-maritime-nantaise.com/wp-content/uploads/Plaquette-MN-Pelican-2019.pdf).

The project WISAMO rig is being installed on the ro/ro, which was built in 1999, and is currently docked in Spain’s El Astillero Port.

Currently, there are twenty-one large commercial ships equipped with wind propulsion systems. Twenty-five large commercial vessels, with a combined displacement of 1.2 million dwt, will have wind propulsion systems installed by the end of this year, according to estimates from the [International Windship Association](https://www.wind-ship.org/en/).
