![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/belemarrives2.jpg)Tens of thousands of people welcomed [the Olympic torch](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-torch-flame-relay-athens-a230ae329fd4900af52088a5dea0dbc5) Wednesday in the southern French city of Marseille, marking another milestone in the lead-up to the Summer Games in Paris. The flame arrived after a 12-day trip from Greece onboard the [*Belem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belem_\(ship\)), a 128-year-old three-masted barque that once transported sugar from France’s colonies in the West Indies.

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics/flame-arrive-marseille-amid-tight-security-2024-05-08/) reports that the torch was brought to land by Florent Manaudou, France’s 2012 Olympic men’s 50 metres freestyle swimming champion, who handed it to Paralympic athlete Nantenin Keita, a 400 metres gold medallist at the Rio Games in 2016.  
She then passed it on to Marseille-born rapper Jul, who lit the cauldron in front of an ecstatic crowd estimated at 150,000. Earlier a flotilla of pleasure boats had welcomed the *Belem* to French shores.

  
*Belem* made her maiden voyage as a cargo ship in 1896, transporting sugar from the [West Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies "West Indies"), cocoa, and coffee from [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil") and [French Guiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana "French Guiana") to [Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes), France.
