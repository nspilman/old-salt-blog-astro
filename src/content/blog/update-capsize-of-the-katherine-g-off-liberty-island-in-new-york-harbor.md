On Friday morning, [we posted about the capsize of the “tugboat” *Katherine G*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/06/three-rescued-as-tug-capsizes-off-liberty-island-new-york-harbor/), off Liberty Island  in New York harbor.  It turns out that the *Katherine G* is not  tugboat in the conventional sense.  Will Van Dorp at the [tugster blog](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/pioneers-in-the-sixth-boro-2-and-more/) calls it a “*lift-boat*” rather than a tug.  It has three distinctive “spuds,” vertical columns that can be dropped to the bottom to stabilize or lift the boat, to provide a stable work platform.  It does not appear that the spuds were down when she capsized.

[The NewYorkologoy blog](http://www.newyorkology.com/archives/2012/04/tugboat_capsize.php)  comments that the “*[Katherine G](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2010/04/11/morris-canal-tugs-2/), …has been identified as both a work barge and tugboat*.”  They go on to say that the Katherine G had been “*assisting with the interior renovations at the [Statue of Liberty](http://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm)*” and that it “*capsized as it was preparing to transport a 60-ton construction crane off Liberty Island, according to officials from the Coast Guard and National Park Service*.”  So it sounds like someone made a serious mistake when loading the crane.  Fortunately, there were no serious injuries.
