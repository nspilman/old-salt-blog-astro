In January 2016, [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/01/boiler-trouble-mystic-seaport-steamer-sabino/) about how during a major restoration of the [1908 coal-fired steamer *Sabino*](https://www.mysticseaport.org/locations/sabino/) at the [Mystic Seaport Museum](https://www.mysticseaport.org/), it was determined that the boiler was beyond repair and would need to be replaced. Now with new decking and planking and a reverse-engineered 1908 boiler, the steamboat *Sabino* is back.
