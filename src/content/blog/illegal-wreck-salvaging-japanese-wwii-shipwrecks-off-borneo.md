Remains of Rice Bowl Wreck

Last November, we [posted about the wrecks of three Dutch World War IIship wrecks](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/11/mystery-vanished-dutch-wwii-shipwrecks/) in the Java Sea that have apparently vanished.   The three ships; the [HNLMS *De Ruyter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_De_Ruyter_\(1935\)), [HNLMS *Java*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Java_\(1921\)) and [HNLMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Kortenaer_\(1927\)) *Kortenaer;*  had been in waters 70 meters deep, 60 miles off the Indonesian coast.  Now, two of the three wrecks have disappeared, while a significant portion of the third is missing. Illegal scrappers operating grabs from barges are considered to be the likely culprits.

Now, the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/images-reveal-three-more-japanese-wwii-shipwrecks-torn-apart-for-scrap?CMP=twt_gu) reports that the wrecks of three Japanese transport ships sunk off Borneo during World War II have been largely destroyed by a Chinese crane ship engaging in illegal scrapping. The ships; *[Kokusei Maru](http://wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?133880)*, *[Higane Maru](http://wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?121317)* and *[Hiyori Maru](http://wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?121318);* were all within a kilometer of each other and have been [popular dive sites](http://divingkotakinabalu.com/dive-usukan-wrecks) in Malaysia’s Sabah state. 

The [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/images-reveal-three-more-japanese-wwii-shipwrecks-torn-apart-for-scrap?CMP=twt_gu) reports: *Scuba diver Monica Chin said local fishermen called her late last month to say a large Chinese vessel with workers on board was using a crane to tear apart the Japanese ships.*

*Photos and video footage taken by the fisherman and passed to the Guardian show a large ship with a giant crane for hoisting underwater material. Ship-tracking websites describe the vessel as a “grab dredger”.*

*The looting of Australian, American, British, Dutch and Japanese warships for scrap metal in south-east Asian seas has caused outrage, with veterans and governments arguing that the vessels must be preserved as underwater war graves for sailors.*

Locally, the three wrecks are known as Rice Bowl Wreck – named after its cargo of hundreds of bowls – Upside Down Wreck and Usukan Wreck. Now, two of the three ships are said to be effectively gone while the third, the Rice Bowl Wreck, was described as “heap of metal piled up into a ball”.  The video below shows diving on the Rice Bowl Wreck before it was destroyed by the scrappers.
