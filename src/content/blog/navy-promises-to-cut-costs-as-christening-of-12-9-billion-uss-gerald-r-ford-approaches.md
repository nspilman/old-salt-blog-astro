Ford* (CVN-78)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_R._Ford-class_aircraft_carrier), was floated in the drydock last month. She will be christened this Saturday, November 9th at the Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia. In addition to other superlatives, she is the most costly aircraft carrier ever built. When the ship finally goes into service in 2016, she is expected to have cost $12.9 billion dollars. The ship is roughly 24% over budget. Rear Admiral Thomas Moore, the officer in charge of aircraft carriers, promised recently that the next carrier, the USS *John F. Kennedy*, would cost $1.2 billion less.
