After spending the better part of a month getting to Nome, Alaska to deliver an emergency supply of fuel to last the winter, the ice-strengthened Russian tanker *[Renda](http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Renda-8129618.html)* has finally off-loaded its cargo – 1.3 million gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline for the town of 3,600.  Now, the only problem faced by the tanker and its escort vessel, the [USCG icebreaking cutter *Healy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Healy_\(WAGB-20\)), is to break back through the ice to open water. The delivery was the first ever winter resupply of the Western Alaskan town by water.  Once clear of the ice, the *Renda* will return to Russia while the *Healy* will unload supplies at Dutch Harbor, Alaska before returning to its home port in Seattle.
