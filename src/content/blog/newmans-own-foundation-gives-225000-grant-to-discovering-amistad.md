![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Amistadname.jpg)[Newman’s Own Foundation](http://newmansownfoundation.org/) has awarded a $225,000 sustainability grant to the non-profit [Discovering Amistad](https://discoveringamistad.org/), the group which operates the replica schooner *Amistad*.  

Discovering *Amistad* operates the replica of the historic schooner *Amistad,*  a 129-foot 19th century Baltimore clipper which was the site of a July 1839 slave revolt by Mende captives, who had been enslaved in Sierra Leone, and were being transported from Havana, Cuba, to their purchasers’ plantations. The schooner sailed to Long Island and the Africans were jailed in New Haven, CT.  A series of court cases over whether the Africans should be freed or sent back to Cuban slaveholders ended in a Supreme Court case in 1841 in which the survivors were ultimately freed.

The replica *Amistad* was built at Mystic Seaport Museum and launched in 2000.  The current organization acquired the schooner in 2016 after the previous non-profit shut down with more than $2 million in debt.  Discovering Amistad provides full-year programming on the schooner, in classrooms and at historic sites of partner organizations. It enables children and adults in Connecticut and the region to discover the story of the Amistad and its impact on Connecticut and the nation.

As reported by [The Day](https://www.theday.com/article/20191115/NWS01/191119588):

The late actor Paul Newman launched Newman’s Own brand of foods and beverages, such as its popular salad dressings, salsa, coffee, and popcorn, in 1982 and started donating the proceeds to charity. In 2005, he created the Newman’s Own Foundation to continue the charitable initiatives. Since 1982, the endeavors have donated more than $560 million to charities around the world.

In announcing the grant, the foundation said it’s committed to funding “innovative programs focused on equity, civic engagement, and social justice.”

“We are pleased to support Discovering Amistad’s initiatives,” said Kelly Giordano, managing director at Newman’s Own Foundation. “The organization’s programs dovetail with our mission to advance conversation and action around equity and to empower students in the communities we serve.”

Len Miller, the chairman of Discovering Amistad’s board of directors, said Wednesday that the grant, which will be payable over three years, will allow the organization to add full-time staff, educators and hire a full- or part-time executive director in addition to supporting its programs.

“This makes a big difference for our organization,” he said.
