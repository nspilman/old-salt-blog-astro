Some absolutely wonderful photography and video as [photographer Lisa Denning](http://www.oceaneyesphotography.com/) talks about her process of making pictures of humpback whales off the island of Rurutu in French Polynesia.  From [Time magazine](http://www.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,730801145001_2042288,00.html):

  
  
I will admit to being surprised by one comment made by Ms. Denning. She worries that the humpbacks she photographs will be victims of the dreaded Japanese whaling fleet.    The good news is that Japan does not hunt humpback whales. The Japanese hunt almost exclusively the non-endangered Southern minke whale. The bad news is that humpbacks do face very real threats, including from pollution, entrapment in drift nets, ship strikes and the military use of sonar.  We are not likely to do anything meaningful in protecting the endangered species of whales if ignore the real threats to their survival.
