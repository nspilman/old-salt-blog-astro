She wrote more than 600 poems which were published in more than two dozen volumes.  The March 27, 1915 edition of the [Spectator magazine reviewed her book “Sailortown”](http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/27th-march-1915/20/recent-verse) saying,  “*No one, not even Mr. Masefield, has written finer sea ballads or come closer to the heart of those who go down to the great waters.”*   [AlPoetry.com has a wonderful collection of her work available online.](http://allpoetry.com/Cicely_Fox_Smith)
