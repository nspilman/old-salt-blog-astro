The *A.J. Meerwald* is an authentically restored 1928 oyster schooner operated as a hands-on sailing classroom throughout the region as well as offering shore-based programs and events in her home port of Bivalve on the scenic Maurice River in Cumberland County.  
  
Both the 5K and the 1 mile routes are a combination of cross country and paved rural roads passing through scenic wetlands and the historic villages of Port Norris & Bivalve NJ.

The race will be timed by L&M Sports and the results will be posted at lmsports.com. Entry fees are $15 for adults; $10 for children aged 14 and under. Advance registration is highly recommended. On the day of the race, the entry fee for the 5K will be $20 for adults. Proceeds benefit the schooner *A.J. Meerwald*, as well as local and international Rotary projects.

Registration starts at 8:00 a.m. and the races start at 9:00 a.m. Afterwards, there will be an awards ceremony on the dock overlooking the scenic Maurice River, plus refreshments, music, games for the kids, and tours of the schooner A.J. Meerwald.

Race t-shirts will be given to the first 100 registrants. Awards will be presented to the first three overall male & female finishers in both the 5K and the 1-mile runs. Awards in the 5K will be presented to the first three male & female finishers in various age categories; and to the first male & female Port Norris residents, BDP volunteers and runners with pets!
