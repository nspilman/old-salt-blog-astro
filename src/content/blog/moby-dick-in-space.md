Herman Melville’s *[Moby Dick](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GCTQ7M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B003GCTQ7M)*  was not a commercial success when published in 1851. Nevertheless, the story of the great white whale remains powerful and timeless, for good or ill.  Last December, we posted about the straight to DVD movie, [2010: Moby Dick](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/12/10/2010-moby-dick-straight-to-dvd-must-see/), a “re-imagined” telling of the novel featuring Captain Ahab in a nuclear submarine.   Last September, [we posted about the movie, Age of Dragons,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/09/02/moby-dick-with-dragons-this-cant-be-good/) a retelling of the tale with dragons instead of whales.  Now we hear that movie director, Lynne Ramsay, will be directing a sci-fi version of *Moby Dick –* sort of a *Moby Dick* in Space.  We recommend just reading, or re-reading, the book.
