[![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/soirigging.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mcmckenna/2188165377/)Greg Gushaw 68, an experienced volunteer, docent and a member of the board of trustees of the [Maritime Museum of San Diego](http://www.sdmaritime.org/) fell to his death last Sunday from aloft on the *[Star of India](http://www.sdmaritime.org/star-of-india/).* Ironically, he fell during a safety training exercise.   His death is reported to be the first on the *Star of India since the 1800s.   The *Star of India*, built in 1863, is the world’s oldest ship that still actively sails.*

*[Man Dies After Falling Overboard From Star Of India Ship](http://www.10news.com/news/24301512/detail.html)*  
  
*A Coronado man who volunteered on the Star of India died after he fell from the sailing ship’s mast, hit his head and landed in the water next to the historic ship.*

*Greg Gushaw fell 40 to 50 feet from the mast at the Star of India Sunday morning. Officials said the 68-year-old hit his head on the ship on the way down and then plunged into the water.*

*Gushaw was transported to an area hospital with advanced cardiac resuscitative efforts in progress. At the hospital, efforts to revive Gushaw continued, but were of no avail and he was pronounced dead.*

*According to crew members, Gushaw was a well-liked, long-time volunteer aboard the ship, as well as a docent and a member of the board of trustees.*

*No one knows what caused Gushaw to fall.*

*“We know he did have a harness,” a San Diego Harbor Police officer told 10News. “That’s required by the maritime museum.”*

*Police do not know if the harness malfunctioned or if something else caused him to slip. In a cruel twist of irony, the men were in the middle of a training exercise specifically involving safety while on the mast.*
