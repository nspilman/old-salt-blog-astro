![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ns_savannah_2008.jpg)In 1819, the *[SS Savannah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Savannah)* was first steamship in the world to cross the Atlantic Ocean.   Despite this accomplishment, the *Savannah* was a commercial failure and was converted back to sail shortly after returning from Europe.   It is somehow fitting that one hundred and forty years later in 1959,  the first nuclear powered cargo ship would be named after the *SS Savannah*.   Like her namesake the *NS Savannah* was a commercial failure, operating at a loss between 1962 and 1971, before being decommissioned.  The *NS* *Savannah* is currently laid up in the Port of Baltimore, Maryland.

The [Historic Naval Ships Association](http://www.hnsa.org/index.htm) has put together a fascinating [“virtual tour”of the](http://hnsa.org/savannah/) *[NS Savannah](http://hnsa.org/savannah/)*, the “ship of the future” that time  left behind.

*[VIRTUAL TOUR OF NS SAVANNAH](http://hnsa.org/savannah/)*

From the virtual tour –

*Savannah had five missions:*

1.  *To demonstrate to the world the employment of nuclear power in an instrument of peace for the benefit of mankind,*
2.  *To bring the power of the atom into the market places of the world in peaceful trade and commerce,*
3.  *To enlighten the public to the fact that nuclear-powered ships are entirely dependable and safe,*
4.  *To stimulate early solutions to such problems as international liability and indemnification, and, win for nuclear ships, acceptance in the world’s ports,*
5.  *To give the Maritime Administration and the Atomic Energy Commission the opportunity for prudently assessing the possible contributions of atomic power to the progress of the American Merchant Marine in providing shipping services on routes essential for maintaining the flow of the foreign commerce of the United States.*

*To achieve this she was built as a cargo ship, passenger ship, and roving ambassador for the Atoms for Peace program. To support the last two, she contains larger and more luxurious public spaces than might be expected. This reception area outside the purser’s office provided a first, and dramatic impression that Savannah was not an ordinary ship.*

*A port visit by Savannah created created was quite an event. She hosted over 1.3 million visitors during her short life.*
