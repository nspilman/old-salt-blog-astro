The American yachts [Comanche and Rambler are battling over the lead in the Rolex Sydney-Hobart Race](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/27/sydney-to-hobart-wild-oats-xi-one-of-11-forced-out-but-comanche-recovers), which has turned into a major boat-breaker. Twenty-nine boats, representing [a quarter of the fleet,](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-27/us-yachts-in-tussle-for-sydney-to-hobart-line-honours/7055516) have retired from the race, most with damage from severe weather. The eight-time race winner and favorite, Wild Oats XI withdrew yesterday with a torn mainsail. If either *Rambler* or *Comanche* succeeds in winning the race, it will be the first time that an international yacht has won since 2001 and the first time that an American boat has won since 1998.

Both *Comanche* and *Rambler* are sailing with damage to their rudders. One of *Comanche*‘s two rudders was damaged in heavy weather yesterday, but the crew were able to make repairs so that the boat could continue racing. Last night, one of *Rambler*‘s rudders was damaged when it struck a submerged object, possibly a whale. The Australian yacht, *Ragamuffin*, reported dodging several whales. *Ragamuffin* and Italian yacht *Maserati* are currently battling in a closely sailed contest for the third place slot.

The Sydney-Hobart Race is notorious for damaging boats and injuring crew. In the 2004 race, 57 yachts retired out of 116 competing. The 1998 race was marked by tragedy as six sailors died and five boats sank. Only 44 of the 115 yachts competing finished the race. In this year’s race, the yacht *Black Jack* is said to have retired due to a crew member with a suspected broken leg. No other serious injuries have been reported.
