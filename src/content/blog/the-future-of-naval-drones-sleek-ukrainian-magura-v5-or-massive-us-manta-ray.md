![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mantaray.jpg)The Ukrainian Magura V5 naval drones have proven to be fast, deadly, and cheap.  As we posted last August, Ukrainian naval drones are [redefining warfare in the Black Sea](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2023/08/ukrainian-naval-drones-redefining-warfare-in-the-black-sea/); quite an accomplishment for a beleaguered nation that almost wholly lacks a navy.

Recently, Northrop Grumman revealed an underwater drone named the [Manta Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_underwater_vehicle#Manta_ray). The drone, built for the [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency](https://www.darpa.mil/) (DARPA). The drone has been under development since 2020. The Manta Ray represents a new class of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), that were developed to perform long-duration, long-range military missions with as little human oversight as possible. The craft is also capable of harvesting energy from the ocean.

As described by [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/19/manta-ray-sea-drone-northrop-grumman), the uncrewed underwater vehicle Manta Ray’s almond-shaped body, rounded nose, horizontal fins and vertical tail can be spotted in the 360-degree [video shared by maker Northrop Grumman](https://youtu.be/o6cDmXFkAdM?si=KZ0_c-YrwQ2IjzRW).

*   While its dimensions are not publicly discussed, [the UUV](https://www.axios.com/2019/02/13/increasing-autonomy-under-the-sea) is considered “extra large” in military parlance. It dwarfs nearby people and boats.
*   The drone is modular, meaning it is easily taken apart and reassembled in the field. The Manta Ray prototype was shipped cross-country in pieces for at-sea assessments earlier this year.
*   The vessel glides through the water, dips below the waves and resurfaces in the clip. Little wake is seen.

The Manta Ray is sufficiently large that it was spotted by [users of Google maps](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/secret-us-underwater-drone-manta-ray-spotted-on-google-map-later-removed-heres-have-a-look-101719295564701.html) at the Port Hueneme naval base in California.

Which model of naval drone — the Ukrainian Magura 5 or the US Manta Ray — will prove to be more successful? That will, no doubt, depend on the mission and circumstances.
