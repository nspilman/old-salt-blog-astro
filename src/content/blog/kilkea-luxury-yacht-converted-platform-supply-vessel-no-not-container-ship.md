![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/01/Svardpsvyacht.jpg)The [article begins](https://newatlas.com/kilkea-explorer-yacht-container-ship/43065/), “Your average container ship could never be described as luxurious, but the *Kilkea* is not your average container ship.” Indeed. And it never was. Several other media sources also describe the yacht as a “converted container ship.” It is not. Apparently, container ships are now sufficiently ubiquitous that anything that floats seems to qualify. 

In fact, the luxury yacht [*Kilkea*](https://www.edmiston.com/yacht-brokerage/yachts/vard-1-08-kilkea) will be a converted Platform Supply Vessel (PSV), not a container ship. Unlike most luxury yachts the *Kilkea* is designed to operate as an”expedition yacht” capable of going virtually anywhere on the globe. While not an icebreaker, the yacht is reportedly ice-classed. It features a helicopter hangar and pad and is capable of operating for 30 days without resupply. 

  
The 268′ long yacht is being built on a [Vard 1-08 PSV](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/VARD-Secures-PSV-Contract-2014-05-19), the workhorse design now deployed serving oil and gas platforms around the world. *Kilkea* is a joint project of Vard shipyards, Fincantieri Yachts and Shackleton Superyachts with U.K. yacht designers Bannenberg & Rowell Designs designing the exterior and interior.

The yacht has a cruising speed of 12 knots and has 18 passenger cabins. 

Beyond the confusion related to calling a PSV a container ship, the quoted cost of the yacht has appeared as $62 million USD, while it is also being [listed for sale at $72 million USD](https://www.worthavenueyachts.com/yachts-for-sale/vard-1-08-kilkea/).
