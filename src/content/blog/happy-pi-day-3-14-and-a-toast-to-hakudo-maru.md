![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/circles-150x111.jpg)Some call today [Pi day](http://www.piday.org/), as the first three digits of the date (3.14) are the first three digits of the constant pi used to calculate the circumference and area of a circle.   Which makes it a good day to raise a toast to [Hakudo Maru](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakudo_Maru).

By [Japanese naming convention, merchant and private ship names end in the word “Maru,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_ship_naming_conventions)” meaning circle.    There are several explanations for this convention, including that ships were thought of as floating castles and *maru* represents the defensive “circles” that protected the castle.  Another explanation is that the suffix honors, [Hakudo Maru](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakudo_Maru), the celestial being in Japanese mythology who is said to have come to Earth 5000 years ago and taught humans how to build ships.  A toast to Hokudo Maru.

My favorite explanation is that *maru* represents the hope that the ship leaves port, travels the world, and returns safely to home port, representing the complete circle of a successful voyage.
