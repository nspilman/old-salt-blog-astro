A 150′ foot long fishing trawler carried away last March by the tsunami off the east coast of Japan has been spotted drifting in the Pacific Ocean, 120 miles off Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada.  About 5 million tons of debris were swept into the ocean in by the magnitude-9.0 earthquake and tsunami which struck Japan.  The trawler is reported to have been used for squid fishing, and was moored in the port of Hachinohe, in the Aomori prefecture, when the tsunami hit.  Thanks to Rick Sterling on the Facebook “[All Things Nautical](https://www.facebook.com/groups/209207912505182/)” group for pointing it out.
