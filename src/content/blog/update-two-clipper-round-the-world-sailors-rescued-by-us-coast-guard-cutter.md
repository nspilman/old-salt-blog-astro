Yesterday we posted the [Clipper Round the World](http://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/) 68′ racer, *Geraldton Western Australia*, which was struck by a large wave in a storm in the Pacific.  The wave sheared off the boat’s steering pedestal, damaged electronics and injured four crew, who were on deck.   The conditions were too rought for a rescue by helicopter, so late Sunday night, the two most seriously injured of the crew, Jane Hitchens, a 50-year-old doctor and Nik Brbora, a 29-year-old engineer, were evacuated by boat to the [USCG Cutter *Bertholf*](http://www.uscg.mil/pacarea/bertholf/).   The cutter is expected to arrive in San Francisco Bay this afternoon.
