![ltread](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ltread.jpg)What should a sailor carry with him or her when clambering around a boat or sailing ship? A rigging knife and marlinspike are common. Some prefer a sheath knife, whereas I am happy with a folding knife and marlinspike that I carry in my pocket on a lanyard clipped to a belt loop.  A multi-tool of some sort can also be useful. I have two different sized “Leatherman” tools that I can also slip into my pocket on a lanyard.  Of course, too much in your pockets or a sheath on your belt can cause your pants to sag. And then there is managing the lanyards which are easy to catch on most anything that one passes by.

Leatherman has a new answer, at last when it comes to a multi-tool. Why not wear all your tools as a bracelet? The [Leatherman Tread](http://www.leatherman.com/tread-425.html#start=25) is just that — 29 tools in one, on a bracelet that also looks like it might be useful in a bar fight. There is a short video showing the Tread’s features after the page break.

It appears to be an ingenious device, which includes everything from screwdrivers to box wrenches to a SIM card pick. The tools can also be swapped out so the bracelet can be customized with tools best suited for your needs.  The Tread might be slightly heavy on the wrist, at just over third of a pound,  but will definitely not cause your pants to sag.  Your wallet will also be somewhat lighter as the Thread is priced at $165. Apparently a watch version is also expected sometime next year. If this the right accessory for your wrist you may have to wait until next year, as [they are sold out on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WBR6P22/?tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=79212278211&hvpos=1t3&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7405030032712559091&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_29fni0elri_b) and should be back in stock on January 2, 2016.
