At around 2:50 AM Monday night a fire broke out on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship, [*Grandeur of the Seas*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Grandeur_of_the_Seas), which had been bound for Coco Cay, Bahamas. The ship was rerouted to Freeport, Bahamas where the 2,224 passengers and 796 crew were disembarked. No serious injuries were reported. The passengers are being flown home from Freeport. [The fire started on an aft mooring deck and spread to the fourth deck](http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/27/world/americas/bahamas-cruise-line-fire/?hpt=hp_c2) at the crew lounge area before it was extinguished, U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman Marilyn Fajardo said. Information on the fire’s cause wasn’t available, she said. [Some passengers are reporting hearing “big explosions”](http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/passengers-royal-caribbean-grandeur-seas-heard-big-explosions/story?id=19268713#.UaU_gECG2So) during the fire. Unlike previous fires in cruise ship engine rooms, the ship never lost power.

Last year, [Royal Caribbean spent $48 million dollars refurbishing Grandeur of the Seas](http://www.vacationstarter.com/travel/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean-international/vs-royal-caribbean-grandeur-of-the-seas-renovation-060112,0,2268132.story) which originally went into service in 1996.
