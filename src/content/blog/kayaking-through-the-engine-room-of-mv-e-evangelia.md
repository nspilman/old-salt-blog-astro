![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/evaleglwreck.jpg)The [MV *Empire Strength*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_E_Evangelia), a 7,355 GRT refrigerated cargo ship, was built by Harland and Wolff in 1942.  In her long career, she had seven owners and four names. When she was purchased by a Greek owner in 1965, she was renamed, MV *E Evangelia.*  Her sailing days ended when she ran aground in 1968 in the Black Sea on the coast of Romania near the seaside resort of Costinești. With her back broken, she was declared a constructive total loss and abandoned. Now the wreck is a local attraction.

The video below captures a kayaker who paddles through an opening into the shell into the engine room. The first diesel engine is probably a generator while the six-cylinder main engine towers above the paddler in the background. The video has a slightly otherworldly quality, like images from a video game or a steampunk dream.
