![hottubboat](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hottubboat.jpg)Only on rare occasional does one find a boat that would be significantly improved if run hard aground.  Here is one example, however.  Many large yachts have hot tubs onboard. This 16′ boat, however, is simply a floating hot tub with a diesel-powered boiler to keep the water hot, an electric motor for propulsion, a sound system and four coolers for beverages (of course.)  I wonder where the PFDs are stored.  Why this nautical accident-waiting-to-happen is in any way superior to a dock-side hot tub is not clear to me.  With luck it would never leave the dock.  Available at [Hammacher Schlemmer for a price of $42,000](http://www.hammacher.com/Product/Default.aspx?sku=12211&promo=Category-NewArrivals&catid=60&PID=3349309&source=cj).
