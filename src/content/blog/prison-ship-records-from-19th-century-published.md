[Prison ship records from 19th Century published](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11307850)

*The records outline the disease-ridden conditions on the “prison hulks”, created to ease overcrowding elsewhere.*  
  
*The prisoners included eight-year-old Francis Creed, who was jailed for seven years on HMS Bellerophon for stealing three shillings worth of copper.*

*The Prison Hulk Registers and Letter Books 1802-1849 include character reports written by the “gaoler”.*

*Creed served his term alongside murderers, thieves and bigamists after being convicted in Middlesex on 25 June, 1823.*

*The records provide a fascinating insight into the personalities of many major, and minor, criminals of the Victorian age”*

*Another inmate of the era was 84-year-old William Davies, who was sentenced to seven years for stealing sheep.*

*Samuel Phillips, a 16-year-old labourer jailed for life for burglary, and unable to read or write, was described as a “doubtful character” who had been to prison before.*

*Thomas Bones was said to be “a bold, daring fellow, not fit to be at large in this country”.*

*Another convict, George Boardman, was “neglected by his parents” and “connected with bad company”.*

*Each of the ships held between 200 and 300 inmates.*

*Mortality rates were high, with about one in three prisoners dying on board, as there was no way to separate the diseased from the healthy in the cramped conditions.*

*Dan Jones, international content director of Ancestry.co.uk, said: “The records provide a fascinating insight into the personalities of many major, and minor, criminals of the Victorian age, as well as documenting a rather unique solution to prison overcrowding.*

*“The records will be of use to family and social historians, and anyone with an interest in the UK penal system.*

*“They detail the rather bleak conditions that those who fell foul of the law would have found themselves in.”*
