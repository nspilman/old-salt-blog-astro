![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/01/costa_concordia9.jpg)According to survivors’ reports, the band on the deck of the *Titanic* continued to play after the last boat departed as the ship sank beneath waters of the icy North Atlantic.  Coincidentally, [a singer aboard the *Costa Concordia*, Amelia Leon](http://www.birminghammail.net/news/birmingham-news/2012/01/16/costa-concordia-sinking-birmingham-survivor-s-ancestor-was-violinist-on-the-titanic-97319-30134344/) says that she is related to a ship’s violinist who died when the *Titanic* sank.

Sadly, a violinist on the *Costa Concordia* is also among the dead. [Sandor Feher, a Hungarian violinist](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/drowned-violinist-doomed-italian-cruise-ship-costa-concordia-helped-children-safety-lost-article-1.1008315)  who worked on the ship, reportedly returned to his cabin to retrieve his violin and never made it back on deck.

Finally, passengers have reported that at the moment that the *Costa Concordia* hit the rocks the [music playing in the ship’s dining room was Celine Dion singing *My Heart Will Go On*](http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/11326476-ultimate-irony-titanic-theme-song-playing-as-costa-concordia-hits-rocks), which was the theme music for James Cameron’s movie, *Titanic*.
