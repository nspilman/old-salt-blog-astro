![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/coffeewith-thecaptain.jpg)We have been remiss in not posting about “Coffee with the Captain,” the wonderful Facebook video blog hosted by the highly respected schooner skipper [Captain Jan Miles](https://pride2.org/about/captains-crew/) of the [*Pride of Baltimore II*](https://pride2.org/).  The series began last April and is wonderfully entertaining as well as informative — discussing schooners, sailing, and the general strangeness of sailing during a pandemic. The most recent episode featured a Zoom chat between Captain Miles, the *Pride*‘s Chief Mate [Jeff Crosby](https://www.facebook.com/prideII/photos/a.10156064541128639/10156064541178639/?type=3&size=1386%2C1917&fbid=10156064541178639), and [Captain Katelinn Shaw](https://www.soundexp.org/about-us/our-team/staff/) of the schooner [*Adventuress*](https://www.soundexp.org/).

In the next episode, streaming live this Saturday, November 21st at 9 AM ET, Captain Miles will be sitting down for some socially distanced coffee with [Captain Daniel Moreland](https://www.picton-castle.com/ship-and-crew/the-captain.html) of the *[Picton Castle](https://www.picton-castle.com/).* The two Captains have known each other for 40+ years, have been shipmates (they sailed together in *Ernestina*) and have each commanded their own vessels while sailing in company in a fleet of tall ships. Captain Moreland was a captain of the original *Pride of Baltimore* many years ago. It should make for a fascinating discussion. 

The great news is that if you cannot make the live broadcast, it will be posted on the *Pride of Baltimore*‘s [Facebook video page](https://www.facebook.com/watch/prideII/), along with the twenty-five or so previous episodes, and lots of other videos about the *Pride*.
