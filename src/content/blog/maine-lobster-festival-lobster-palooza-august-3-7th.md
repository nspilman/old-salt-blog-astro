![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/lobster.jpg)The [Maine Lobster Festival](http://www.mainelobsterfestival.com/) being held in Rockland from August 3rd to the 7th is described as “*Five Days of Feasting and Fun on the Fabulous Coast of Maine!*”  “The festival promises “ *the world’s greatest lobster cooker, 20,000 pounds of lobster, a sea goddess coronation, a big parade, top notch entertainment, an international crate race, fine art, talented crafts people and vendors, US Navy ship tours, cooking contests, marine tent and MORE?!*”  Wow.

There certainly seems to be a lot scheduled.  New York may have its [Mermaid Parade](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/17/busy-weekend-in-new-york-harbor-mermaids-sloops-song/) but Rockland has its [Maine Lobster Festival Big Parade](http://www.mainelobsterfestival.com/main-events/big-parade/) including the newly crowned Sea Goddess, all of the Sea Princesses and their Naval escorts, and King Neptune and his Court. Match that Coney Island! The theme for the 2011 parade is “Lobster-Palooza.” I am not sure exactly what that means, but it sounds like fun.
