Perhaps the best news for the stranded passengers on the disabled cruise ship, *[Carnival Splendor](http://www.carnival.com/cms/faq/default.aspx?faq=sp11072010)*, is that the flush toilets aboard are back in service and that the ship is proceeding slowly under tow to the mainland.   Still lacking refrigeration on the ship, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy have delivered, by helicopter cases, Spam, boxes of croissants and other easy-to-transport food and supplies.  The supplies are being airlifted to the ship on a [Navy Seahawk helicopter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_SH-60_Seahawk) from the aircraft carrier, *[USS Ronald Reagan](http://www.navy.mil/local/cvn76/)*, which arrived on the scene on Tuesday.

Two tugs are now towing the ship with a third as escort.   A [statement by Carnival](http://www.carnival.com/cms/faq/default.aspx?faq=sp11072010) announced, “*Given the ship’s speed and current position, we have decided to take the vessel to San Diego where it is expected to arrive late Thursday.  Additionally, we are in the process of making all the necessary hotel and flight arrangements for our guests. If the ship is unable to maintain sufficient speed under tow, it is possible that we could revert to the previous plan and dock in Ensenada*.”
