*The tall ship Highlander Sea, a longtime symbol of Port Huron, is not expected to hit the waves this summer. What’s more, its time representing the city could be winding down.   Rich Engle, vice president and chief operating officer of Acheson Ventures, said officials are exploring options for the 154-foot gaff-rigged topsail schooner, including the possibility of selling it.*  
  
*The ship, built in 1924 and acquired by Acheson Ventures in 2002, has become the flagship of Port Huron. It often sails to destinations on the Great Lakes, including Chicago, Cleveland and Mackinac Island.*

*While the tall ship Highlander Sea’s future is uncertain, dozens of similar vessels continue to sail the Great Lakes. But officials said the tall-ship industry has taken a hit from the slumping economy, just like everything else. “Highlander Sea is not alone,” said Bert Rogers, executive director of the American Sail Training Association. “But for the most part our members are plugging along, gritting their teeth and facing the strain as best they can.”*
