The first of planned monthly shanty sings will be held at the [Brooklyn Lyceum](http://brooklynlyceum.com/).  All lovers of the music of the sea are welcome.  This Friday’s session is being held in memory of Howie Leifer, who recently died of cancer.  Howie was long-time member of the sea shanty community in New York, as well as a wonderful entertainer and gifted puppeteer.
