![uss georgia](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/uss-georgia.jpg)The nuclear submarine [USS *Georgia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Georgia_\(SSGN-729\)) is now in drydock at the [Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay](http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrse/installations/navsubbase_kings_bay.html).  The *Georgia* was returning after a long international deployment when it ran into buoy No. 23, located at the entrance to the channel leading to the boat’s home port. No one was hurt and the sub made it in under her power.  As reported by [Military.com](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/12/18/uss-georgia-collides-with-buoy.html?ESRC=eb.nl): *The Georgia is one of four Ohio-class submarines that were converted from ballistic missile subs to carry Tomahawk cruise missiles. The boats conduct clandestine missions in coastal areas across the world… Unlike the ballistic missile submarines on base, which return every 70 days, the Georgia and another converted sub, USS Florida, remain deployed for up to a year.*    

So, basically, the submarine returns from a long deployment overseas, which may have included clandestine operations in coastal waters, then smacks a buoy just a few miles from home. What can one say? Stuff happens. Far better to have this sort of problem close to home than in distant waters.
