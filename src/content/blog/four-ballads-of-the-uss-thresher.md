![thresehr2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/thresehr2.jpg)We recently posted an embedded video of Tom Paxton’s song, “*The Thresher Disaster*” sung my threelegsofman.  about the loss of the nuclear submarine USS *Thresher* in 1963.  Brian Frizell pointed out that Paxton’s song was not the only ballad about the *Thresher*.  The Kingston Trio also sang a “[*Ballad of the Thresher*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w41nF5yrexY).”  The singer/songwriters Phil Ochs and Pete Seeger also had songs about the disaster, both titled simply “*The Thresher*.”  Why did the sinking of this one ship inspire at least four songs?

It is probably a matter of timing. The *Thresher* sank during the peak of what is often referred to as the [American folk music revival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_folk_music_revival).  Of course, these songs about the sinking of the nuclear submarine are not the first or only songs written about the sinking of relatively modern ships.  Gordon Lightfoot’s “[Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/the-wreck-of-the-edmund-fitzgerald-november-10-1975/)” memorializes the 1975 sinking of the Great Lakes ore boat the SS *Edmund Fitgerald,* just as Woody Guthrie’s “[Sinking of the Reuben James](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/seventy-years-ago-today-the-sinking-of-the-u-s-s-reuben-james-october-31-1941/)” recalls the men lost when a German submarine sank the Clemson-class destroyer [*Reuben James*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Reuben_James_\(DD-245\)) just before the start of World War II.  Likewise the [“Titanic” song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Titanic_\(song\)), better known as “It Was Sad When That Great Ship Went Down” was written sometime in the 1920 and popularized by the Carter Family.

What is interesting about the four different Thresher songs is the difference in perspective. The Kingston Trio is the most simplistically patriotic, beginning “Oh, the Thresher, the finest atomic ship, that ever dived for the sea”  
with a chorus of “Every man-jack aboard was a hero.”  The Paxton version focuses on the tragedy, “Although none of them was mine, we lost 129 and I feel just like I lost a friend ..it was just a diving test, but they laid her there to rest, on that cold and lonesome ocean floor,” adding only a touch of anti-war sentiment  “and I sit and wonder why, those poor sailors had to die, and I wonder when this killing’s going to end.  Phil Ochs’ lyric is sardonically ironic – “she’ll always run silent and she’ll always run deep, though the ocean has no pity, though waves will never weep.” Not surprisingly, Pete Seeger’s version is the most political of the four – “I hope this loss will bring to pass, a day we’ll live to see, when ship’s are all designed to sail together peacefully.”
