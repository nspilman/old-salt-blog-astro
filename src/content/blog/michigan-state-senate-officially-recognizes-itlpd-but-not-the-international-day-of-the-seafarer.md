Senator with “Pirate” Eyepatch

I was under the impression that the State of Michigan had serious problems – a $2 billion budget shortfall, its largest city in dire economic straits, schools closing for lack of funding, that sort of thing.  Things must be better than I realized as [Sen. Roger Kahn](http://www.misenategop.com/senators/contact.asp?District=32) (R-Saginaw) proposed and the Senate passed a [resolution officially recognizing “International Talk Like a Pirate Day”.](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/04/arr-michigan-to-formally-recognize-international-talk-like-a-pirate-day/)  If they have time for this sort of resolution in the Senate, things must not be as bad as I thought.  One can only hope that the eye patch that Senator Kahn wore while presenting the resolution is not also his proposal for ophthalmic heath care.

The [resolution](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2013-2014/resolutionadopted/Senate/htm/2013-SAR-0067.htm) itself notes that “International Talk Like A Pirate Day” was started “as a way to express \[the event founder’s\] individual passion for nautical plundering.” The resolution goes on to say that the State of Michigan is responsible for “promoting worthy maritime initiatives” and that “Talk Like a Pirate Day”  “celebrates beloved maritime activities.”  Linking “nautical plundering” with “worthy maritime initiatives” and “beloved maritime activities” all in one very short resolution is just dumb. Really dumb.

One event that the State of Michigan did not choose to endorse is the [IMO International Day of the Seafarer](http://www.imo.org/about/events/pages/day-of-the-seafarer.aspx) held on June 25 of each year to recognize “the invaluable contribution seafarers make to international trade and the world economy, often at great personal cost to themselves and their families.” Apparently the Michigan Senate prefers pirates.

Although Michigan is a mid-western state, it borders four of the five Great Lakes and has 3,126 miles of Great Lakes shoreline.  The state has its own [maritime academy](https://www.nmc.edu/maritime/about/index.html).  The [US Great Lakes fleet includes 57 large self-propelled vessels](http://www.lcaships.com/industry/) and tug/barge units moving dry-bulk cargoes with a transport capacity of 115,000,000 tons of cargo.   The Great Lakes shipping industry plays an important role in the United States economy. Nevertheless, the Michigan Senate chose to endorse “talking like a pirate” rather than to support professional mariners in their home waters and around the world  — a world where piracy remains a serious threat to seafarers every day. What can one say, but Aarrgh.
