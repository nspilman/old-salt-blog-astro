![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vikingsky.jpg)Last weekend, the cruise ship *Viking Sky*, with over 1,300 passengers and crew aboard, [lost all four of its engines](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/03/cruise-ship-viking-sky-being-evacuated-in-storm-off-norwegian-coast/) in high winds and rough seas off the Norwegian coast and came [precariously close](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/03/update-cruise-ship-viking-sky-underway-after-extremely-close-call/) to drifting onto a rocky reef.  Now the [Norwegian Maritime Authority has concluded the engines’ failure](https://www.euronews.com/2019/03/27/cruise-ship-to-evacuate-its-1-300-passengers-after-sending-mayday-signal-off-the-coast-of) “was directly caused by low oil pressure”.  All four of the ship’s engines failed but the crew managed to restart one of them just in time.

Whether the four diesel engines share a common lube oil system or whether each of the four engines was independently impacted by the rough seas is unclear.

The 47,800-tonne ship was travelling from Tromsø to Stavanger, carrying 915 guests and 458 crew, when the ship lost power near the notoriously rough waters of Hustadvika Bay.
