*New Zealand’s only submarine commander celebrated his 100th birthday today, with hundreds of people from his local sailing community.*

*Con Thode and 260 friends and family had his birthday bash at the Royal Yacht Squadron to celebrate the milestone in style.*

*“I’m very proud to have Con as my great grandfather because he drives, he sails and he’s 100,” said great grandson Joshua Lincoln.*

*The Queen also paid her respects by sending in the famous letter for Thode to read out to the party.*

*Thode was prompted to join the Navy after a German fleet bombed the Liverpool restaurant he was eating in. He then went on to become New Zealand’s first and only submarine commander in World War Two.*

*Thode has spent many years at the helm of the Spirit Of Adventure introducing young sailors to the water, a lifestyle he loves.*

*“Something under the sail with a good breeze going along fairly rapidly is just the greatest thrill of mine.”*
