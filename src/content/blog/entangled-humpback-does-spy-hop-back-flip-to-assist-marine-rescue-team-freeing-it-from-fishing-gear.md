A wonderful story from the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-63353569). 

After receiving multiple calls about a humpback whale entangled in 300ft (91m) of fishing gear and a buoy, Canadian officials dispatched a marine rescue team.

They tracked down the beleaguered whale off Texada Island, British Columbia, and after nearly five hours the ocean giant helped out the crew by pulling this dramatic maneuver, a combined spy hop and back flip to assist in freeing itself from the entangling fishing gear caught in its mouth. Remarkably, it was all caught on video.
