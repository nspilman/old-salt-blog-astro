![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Barcelona5.jpg)On Sunday, a [fire broke out on the ferry *KM Barcelona VA*](https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-passenger-ferry-fire-4872d675acc1fdd0d53811b1d0b0e55b) in the Celebes Sea off the northern coast of Sulawesi Island, Indonesia. The ferry was en route to Manado, on its regular half-day journey from Melonguane port, according to First Adm. Franky Pasuna Sihombing, chief of the Manado navy base. Officials reported that 575 people were rescued, while three had died and two were still missing.

The ferry’s manifest listed only 280 passengers and 15 crew members at the time of the fire. It is common for the number of passengers on a boat or ferry to differ from the manifest in Indonesia. This discrepancy can contribute to accidents and can complicate search and rescue efforts, Sihombing said.

Local media reports that the passenger capacity of the ferry is 600 people.

A coast guard ship, six rescue vessels, and several inflatable boats were deployed in the rescue operation, Sihombing said. The crews pulled many people from the sea and took them to nearby islands. Local fishermen also saved some survivors, wearing life jackets, as they drifted in the choppy waters.

A [recent report stated the *KM Barcelona VA* remained afloat](https://shipwrecklog.com/log/2025/07/km-barcelona-va/) after the fire was extinguished and would be taken under tow.  Authorities have not reported the cause of the fire. News reports state the *KM Barcelona VA* had been delayed prior to its scheduled departure. There is some speculation that the ferry was not in working order when it left port.
