![thamsetallship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thamsetallship.jpg)Another great event that I wish I was attending.  Starting tomorrow September 5th and lasting through the 9th, the [Royal Greenwich Tall Ships Festival](http://www.royalgreenwich.gov.uk/tallships/site/index.php) will take place at [three sites across Royal Greenwich and one in neighboring Canary Wharf](http://www.royalgreenwich.gov.uk/tallships/info/13/planning_your_visit).  The tall ships will start arriving on the Thames today after an exciting race from Falmouth.  More than [50 tall ships](http://www.royalgreenwich.gov.uk/tallships/directory/2/the_tall_ships/category/6/categoryInfo/1) will be participating.  The event is said to be the largest gathering of tall ships on the Thames in over 25 years.

The festivities include vessels from tall to small ships. Each day of the event features a [parade of classic ships](http://www.sailroyalgreenwich.co.uk/regatta-information/parades).

*   On Friday, there will be a parade of [traditional Thames barges](http://www.royalgreenwich.gov.uk/tallships/events/event/35/) along the River Thames, from Lebara Festival Village in Maritime Greenwich to the Royal Arsenal Woolwich Festival Village from 3PM-4:30PM.
*   On Saturday, from Noon to 2PM, there will be a parade of traditional ships from Maritime Greenwich to the Royal Arsenal Woolwich.
*   Her Majesty the Queen’s row barge Gloriana, accompanied by an escort of traditional rowing boats, will parade on Sunday between 11:30 AM and 1 PM, followed by races for the Trinity House 500 Challenge.
*   On Monday there will be parade of classic steam vessels, a vintage fireboat, and ships that took part in the rescue from Dunkirk in 1940 at 2PM-3:30PM from Maritime Greenwich to Royal Arsenal Woolwich.
*   The festival ends with a grand [Parade of Sail](http://www.sailroyalgreenwich.co.uk/en/regatta-information/parades/the-parade-of-sail) on Tuesday from 1PM-4PM as the tall ships leave Greenwich.

Onshore on Saturday, the crew parade will include over 1,000 people – including tall ships’ crew, marching bands, and young people from around the world.  Each of the festival villages will feature music food and exhibits. Visiting the ships is free. Tall ship cruises will be leaving from [Royal Arsenal Woolwich](http://www.royalgreenwich.gov.uk/tallships/events/event/29/tall_ships_cruises). Buy tickets here.
