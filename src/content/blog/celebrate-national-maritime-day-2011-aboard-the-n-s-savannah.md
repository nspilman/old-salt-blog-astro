NS Savannah

In the US,  [National Maritime Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Maritime_Day) is May 22nd. The day was chosen to commemorate the departure from Savannah, Georgia  of the American steamship, [SS *Savannah*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Savannah), first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean,  on May 24, 1819.   To celebrate National Maritime Day, the [Baltimore Port Alliance](http://baltimoreportalliance.org/) is hosting tours on the [NS *Savannah*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS_Savannah), the first and last US flag nuclear merchant ship.

Ironically though both ships named *Savannah* were considered technological break-throughs in their day, neither was a commercial success.
