![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mrtrashwheel.jpg)We recently [posted about various devices and schemes](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/02/cleaning-harbors-seas-driftmaster-drones-beyond/) for cleaning plastic and other flotsam from harbors and waterways.  Roberta Weisbrod was kind enough to point out another great example of such a device — Baltimore’s [Inner Harbor Water Wheel, or “Mr. Trash Wheel”](http://baltimorewaterfront.com/healthy-harbor/water-wheel/) as it is known to locals. 

Mr. Trash Wheel is a water-wheel and solar powered conveyor system which lifts drifting trash from the water and drops it into a hopper barge, to be towed away to a disposal center. Since the start of operations in 2014, Mr. Trash Wheel has removed over a million and a half points of trash from the harbor.  This includes 628,192 plastic bottles; 724,625 polystyrene containers; 9,935,220 cigarette butts; 7,919 glass bottles; 519,443 grocery bags; and 718,201 chip bags. 

Mr. Trash Wheel has worked so well that other trash wheels are being installed all around the harbor. [Professor Trash Wheel](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-professor-trash-wheel-20161204-story.html) was installed last year in Canton and a third wheel is planned for the [Gwynns Falls.](http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/green/blog/bal-gr-gwynns-falls-trash-wheel-story.html) This summer, the City of Baltimore announced that they were installing [Captain Trash Wheel in Masonville Cove](http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/baltimore-insider-blog/bs-fe-captain-trash-wheel-20171106-story.html) on the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River.
