The movie was inspired by C.S. Forester’s novel, *The Good Shepherd*.

This is not my review. I had planned on writing a review but so far I have been unable to see the movie, which is streaming only on Apple TV. Not for a lack of trying, I attempted to sign up for Apple TV so that I could stream it on a PC, but I gave up after about 20 minutes, which included getting several “page not found” messages when I attempted to access Apple’s online support. So rather than post my own review, I am posting two videos.

The first is an hour-long discussion with four maritime historians, about the accuracy, or lack thereof, of *Greyhound*. Sponsored by the [North American Society for Oceanic History (NASOH)](https://nasoh.org/) the video features Sal Mercogliano as host, with Dr. Chuck Steele of the US Air Force Academy, Dr. David Kohnen of the Naval War College, and Dr. Joseph Moretz an independent scholar on the Royal Navy, providing commentary. The discussion is quite good and worth watching whether or not you have seen Hank’s movie. (If you do not have the time, spoiler alert, the consensus among the historians was that the movie didn’t get very much right.)

Unrelated to historical accuracy, Sal Mercogliano facetiously compared his own problems with Apple TV to the “Battle of the Atlantic.” 

Non-historian critics have been more kind. Greyhound has a 79% rating on [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/greyhound).

The second video is one of the “[History vs Hollywood](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7f9cTFLrL-HQWRRYxKr7KA)” series and while it is not as detailed as the critique provided by the historians, it has the advantage of being only five minutes long.
