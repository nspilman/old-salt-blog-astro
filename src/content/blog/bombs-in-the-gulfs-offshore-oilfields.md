[World War II bombs, mustard gas in Gulf of Mexico need to be checked, experts warn](http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/28/14141378-world-war-ii-bombs-mustard-gas-in-gulf-of-mexico-need-to-be-checked-experts-warn?lite)

*“The bottom line is that these bombs are a threat today and no one knows how to deal with the situation,” Texas A&M oceanographer William Bryant said in a statement ahead of a briefing he’ll give at a weapons disposal conference. “If chemical agents are leaking from some of them, that’s a real problem. If many of them are still capable of exploding, that’s another big problem.”*

*Photos taken during surveys show that some of the chemical weapons canisters, such as those that carried mustard gas, appear to be leaking materials and are damaged, Bryant and others on his team reported.*

*The surveys have turned up 10 dump sites at 60 and 100 miles out — and one of them had a pipeline running through it.*

*Texas has the closest dump, followed by Louisiana, “not far from where the Mississippi River delta area is,” Bryant said. “Some shrimpers have recovered bombs and drums of mustard gas in their fishing nets.*
