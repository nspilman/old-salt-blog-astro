I was fortunate enough to be able to stop by the [schooner *Amistad*](http://discoveringamistad.org/) last week when she tied up alongside [Portside NewYork’s tanker *Mary A. Whalen*](http://portsidenewyork.org/mary-a-whalen/) in the historic Atlantic Basin in Redhook, Brooklyn. She is a beautiful schooner with an important story to tell. *Amistad* is a replica of the original Baltimore clipper of the same name which, in 1839, was seized by captive Africans from Sierra Leone.  A few photos. 

*Amistad* will be returning to the Atlantic Basin and the *Mary A. Whalen* August 11th and will be open to the public for free tours from 10am – 1pm & 2pm – 5pm.  [For directions to Portside NewYork and the Mary A. Whalen, click here.](http://portsidenewyork.org/visitor-info)  Amistad is [Connecticut’s flagship and tall ship ambassador](https://statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/connecticut/state-vessel-aircraft/freedom-schooner-amistad).
