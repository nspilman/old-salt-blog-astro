Domnica Cemortan, the "Mystery Woman"

If there is a moral of this story, I suppose it must be, “don’t leave your lingerie in the captain’s cabin.”  Not long after the *Costa Concordia* ran aground and sank off the island of Giglio on January 13th, there were reports of the ship’s captain, Francesco Schettino, being seen with a “mystery woman.” Described as young and blonde, the reports were variously that the [captain was seen drinking](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/01/20/costa-concordia-captain-seen-drinking-with-blond-before-wreck.html) with her, [having dinner with her](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/01/19/captain-in-cruise-ship-disaster-says-fell-out-ship-during-evacuation/) and [that she was also on the bridge with the captain](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/9026359/Costa-Concordia-mystery-of-blonde-on-the-bridge-of-doomed-liner.html) around the time that the ship ran aground.

The woman’s name is Domnica Cemortan. She is 25 and is from Moldavia. She is a ballet dancer and has worked aboard the *Costa Concordia* as an “international hostess” whose duties may have included serving as a translator for Russian guests. When the ship sank, however, she was neither working as a member of the crew nor was she listed on the passenger manifest.  
  
She had just completed a six month stint working on the ship and was scheduled to get off prior to the start of the ill-fated seven day cruise. Coast Cruises now says that she bought a ticket and stayed aboard the ship as a passenger but had not checked into her room before the ship struck the rock and sank.

She had denied having a romantic relationship with the 52 year old captain, until her lingerie, other articles of clothing and a make-up bag were found by divers in the captain’s submerged cabin. She has now told Italian prosecutors, “Yes, it’s true. I am in love with Captain Schettino…”  Italian authorities consider Ms. Cemortan a witness but not a suspect in the criminal investigation of the ship’s sinking.

Captain Schettino, a married father of a 15-year-old daughter, is under house arrest at his home near Sorrento on suspicion of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship.
