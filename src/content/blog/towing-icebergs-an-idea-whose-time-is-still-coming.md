![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/05/biceberg_0523.jpg)Victor Hugo wrote, “Nothing is stronger than an idea whose time has come.”  There are some ideas whose time always appears to be coming but somehow never quite arrive.  As a young naval architect in the 1970s, I recall predictions that tug boats would be towing icebergs to areas where fresh water is in short supply.   On Sunday, Time magazine posted an article asking, “[Can Towing Icebergs to Water-Short Areas Really Work?](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2071147,00.html)”  With the aid of new technology, the answer may finally be “yes.”   Then again, this is not the first time that Time magazine has addressed the idea of towing icebergs.   It’s article “[Science: Towing Icebergs](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915637-1,00.html)” was published in the magazine in October of 1977.
