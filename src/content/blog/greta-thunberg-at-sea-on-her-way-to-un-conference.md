On Wednesday, 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, [Greta Thunberg](https://classicsailor.com/2019/08/greta-thunberg-sets-sail-from-plymouth/), set sail from Plymouth, England on a racing yacht bound for New York. She is traveling to participate in United Nations climate talks in September, and she refuses to fly because aviation has such an enormous carbon footprint.

She is sailing on [Malizia II](https://www.imoca.org/en/imoca/boats/malizia-ii-yacht-club-de-monaco), an IMOCA 60-foot foiling monohull with solar panels and hydro-generators, resulting in a nearly zero carbon footprint. On Day 2 of the voyage, they are roughly 100 nautical miles west of Cape Finisterre. The voyage is expected to take about two weeks. The trip may be uncomfortable as the boat has a bucket for a toilet, no real galley, and no privacy.

In August 2018, Greta Thunberg, then age 15, left school to begin protesting outside the Swedish parliament about the need for immediate action to combat climate change. Her actions grew into a worldwide movement, the school strike for climate. By March 2019, an estimated 1.4 million students in 112 countries around the world joined her call in striking and protesting for action on climate change.
