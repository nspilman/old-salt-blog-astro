In early August, the Maltese government asked the tanker, [*Maersk Etienne*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:157472/mmsi:219577000/imo:9274642/vessel:MAERSK_ETIENNE), to help a nearby boat in distress. The crew of the tanker found an overcrowded, wooden fishing boat carrying 27 African migrants — including a pregnant woman and a child. They rescued the migrants and proceeded to Malta. After the Maltese authorities requested that the tanker rescue the migrants, the ship was refused permission to dock. Now, 36 days later, the *Maersk Etienne* sits at anchor off Malta with its 27 passengers, in increasingly dire conditions.

Over the weekend, [three of the desperate migrants jumped overboard](https://splash247.com/maersk-etienne-crisis-escalates-as-three-migrants-jump-ship/). They were recovered by the ship’s crew and are being cared for on the ship. 

The [International Chamber of Shipping has joined two UN organizations](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ics-calls-for-action-on-maersk-etienne-standoff) in calling for the safe disembarkation. 

“The conditions are rapidly deteriorating onboard, and we can no longer sit by while governments ignore the plight of these people,” said Guy Platten, ICS’ secretary-general. “This is not the first time that this has happened, and we need governments to live up to their obligations. Time is running out and the responsibility for these people’s safety and security rests squarely with government ministers. This is not COVID related; this is a humanitarian issue pure and simple.”

UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), its migration agency, have both joined the call for a solution to the situation aboard Maersk Etienne. 

“The absence of a clear, safe, and predictable disembarkation mechanism for people rescued in the Mediterranean, continues to pose avoidable risk to life,” said IOM Director General António Vitorino. “IOM and UNHCR have long called on states to move away from the current ad hoc approach and establish a scheme whereby coastal states take equal responsibility in providing a port of safety, followed by a show of solidarity from other EU member states.”

International maritime law dictates that vessels near a boat in distress have an obligation to respond, and merchant vessels in the Mediterranean have long been involved in such rescues. Typically, the rescued migrants are then taken to the nearest safe port.

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/world/europe/migrant-tanker-mediterranean.html) reports that Maersk has been in contact not only with the authorities in Malta, but with those in nearby Tunisia and in Denmark, where the tanker is registered. None have offered a way to get the migrants ashore.

The ship’s master, Capt. Volodymyr Yeroshkin, describes an increasingly challenging situation on board, both for the crew and for the survivors.
