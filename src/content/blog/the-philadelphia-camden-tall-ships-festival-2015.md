![philadelphiafest1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/philadelphiafest1.jpg)The [Philadelphia-Camden Tall Ships Festival](http://tallshipsphiladelphia.com/) running from [June 25-28th](http://www.visitphilly.com/articles/philadelphia/everything-you-need-to-know-about-philadelphia-camden-tall-ships-festival/), promises to be something special. I am sorry that I will be out of town and will miss the festivities. The events begin on Thursday, June 25, with a “Parade of Ships” up the Delaware,  starting around 1 PM and continuing all afternoon, as the more than 16 tall ships arrive on the Philadelphia and Camden waterfronts.  Headlining the tall and historic ships will be *[l’Hermione](http://www.hermione2015.com/)* as she continues her tour of the East Coast. *l’Hermione* is a replica of the 145-foot long Concorde class frigate that brought General Lafayette to the aid of the fledgling United States during the Revolutionary War.  *l’Hermione* will be docked just outside the Independence Seaport Museum.

Also joining in the festival will be the [USCG Barque *Eagle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=USCGC_Eagle_\(WIX-327\)); as well as *[El Galeon Andalucia](https://www.facebook.com/tallshipevent)*, a replica of a late 16th Century fabled merchant vessel and warship; Philadelphia’s official Tall Ship *[Gazela](http://philashipguild.org/ships/gazela/)*; the world traveling barque *[Picton Castle](http://www.picton-castle.com/)*, New Jersey’s tall ship *[A.J. Meerwald](http://bayshorecenter.org/a-j-meerwald/)*, and Portugal’s training ship *[Sagres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRP_Sagres_III)*, among other vessels.
