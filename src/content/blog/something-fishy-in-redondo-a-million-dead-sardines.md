What’s that smelt? (Sorry.) Actually it was a million dead sardines (or anchovies depending on the news reports)  that washed up dead in the King Harbor Marina in Redondo Beach California.

*With the temperature on Tuesday already passing 68F (20C), the dead fish were beginning to smell.*

*Roughly 1,400 boats are moored at the harbour, including about 500 with full-time residents.*

*In some places, the dead fish were so thick boats were unable to leave the marina, officials said.*

*Local officials said they had found no traces of toxins or pollutants, and that they believed the fish had used up all the oxygen in the marina.*

*“We’re confident that it is a naturally occurring, but unusual event,” said Andrew Hughan, spokesman for the California fish and wildlife department.*

*He said it seemed likely that the fish had got lost after entering the marina and had been unable to find their way out. “They get confused easily,” he told the Associated Press news agency.*

*Earlier estimates put the number of dead fish at millions but the state fish and wildlife department later said it believed there were about one million.*

*Redondo Beach is about 16 miles (26km) south-west of Los Angeles.*
