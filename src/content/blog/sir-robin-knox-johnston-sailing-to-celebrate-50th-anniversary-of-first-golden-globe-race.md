![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/04/robinknoxj2.jpg)[The News](https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/people/portsmouth-sailor-sir-robin-knox-johnston-set-to-celebrate-50-years-since-he-sailed-solo-around-the-world-1-8889562) is reporting that [Sir Robin Knox-Johnston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Knox-Johnston) is setting sail today from Portsmouth Harbour, heading to a celebratory tour of Falmouth, where he finished his record-setting voyage on April 22 in 1969, becoming the first person to sail non-stop single-handed around the globe. In doing so, he won [Sunday Times Golden Globe Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Times_Golden_Globe_Race) as well as being the only sailor to finish. 

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of his accomplishment, Sir Robin, 80, will sail [*Suhaili*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suhaili) the 32-foot Bermudan ketch which he sailed around the world, across the original race finish line at Falmouth on Monday, April 22nd. He will be accompanied by *Lively Lady*, restored and sailed by Alan Priddy, and a supporting flotilla of yachts sailed by friends from the world of sailing. 

Following his victory in the Golden Globe Race, Robin Knox-Johnston and Sir Peter Blake won the second Jules Verne Trophy in 1994.  Knox-Johnston organized the first Clipper Round the World Race in 1996, a race around the world sailed by professional captains and amateur crew.

Robin Knox-Johnston’s solo circumnavigation fifty years ago took 312 days. In 2019, [Jean-Luc Van Den Heede won the current Golden Globe Race](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/01/jean-luc-van-den-heede-wins-golden-globe-race-after-221-days-at-sea/), which replicated the technology of the first race, in 221 days. The last [Vendee Globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vend%C3%A9e_Globe) non-stop solo round the world race was won by Armel Le Cléac’h in just over 74 days in 2017.
