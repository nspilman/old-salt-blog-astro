![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/06/VICTOR-MOONEY.jpg)Last February [we posted about Victor Mooney’s third attempt](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/27/nyc-rower-tries-for-third-time-to-cross-atlantic/) to row alone across the Atlantic.   While [Mooney](http://www.goreechallenge.com/), 45 of Forest Hills, New York, has attempted the voyage three times, he has not come close to succeeding thus far.  His first attempt in 2006 lasted only three hours before the boat he was rowing sprang a leak and sank.  His second attempt, in 2007, lasted fifteen days before his  desalinator  broke and he needed to be rescued.   His third attempt ended when after one day at sea his boat cracked and sank. He drifted in a life raft for 14 days before being picked up by a passing ship.  Now Mooney is planning a fourth attempt in December of 2011.

I am reminded of the fallacy of the old saying about the importance of getting right back up on a horse after you have fallen off.  Sometimes when you fall off a horse, it is good to ask yourself if you ever had any business being on the horse in the first place.
