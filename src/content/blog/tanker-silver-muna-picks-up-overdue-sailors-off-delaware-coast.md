On Sunday, the [US Coast Guard Fifth District command center in Virginia was notified](https://coastguardnews.com/coast-guard-and-partners-locate-overdue-sailing-vessel-atrevida-ii/) that the *Atrevida II*, a 30’ Catalina sloop, on a passage from Cape May, N.J. to Marathon, FL, was overdue. Onboard were Kevin Hyde, 65, and Joe Ditomasso, 76, who were last in contact with family and friends on Dec. 3. 

The Coast Guard launched multiple fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and three cutters to search for the *Atrevida II*. Ships from the Navy’s Second Fleet and commercial and recreational vessel traffic joined in the effort. They searched an area of 21,164 square miles of the Atlantic, spanning from northern Florida to the waters east of New Jersey.

On December 13, the sailboat was spotted by the Hong Kong-flagged 50,000 DWT tanker *[Silver Muna](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:4097676/mmsi:477854200/imo:9718856/vessel:SILVER_MUNA)* approximately 214 miles off the Delaware coast. The *Atrevida II* was out of fuel and power, rendering its radios and navigation equipment inoperable. Hyde and Ditomasso gained the attention of the Silver Muna crew by waving their arms and a flag.

Hyde, Ditomasso, and a pet dog were brought aboard *Silver Muna* at 4:18 p.m. They were evaluated by the vessel’s medical staff with no immediate concerns. Hyde and Ditomasso remained aboard *Silver Muna* as it proceeded to its next port of call in New York, New York where they were transferred to a Coast Guard vessel for further evaluation and reunification with their family and friends.
