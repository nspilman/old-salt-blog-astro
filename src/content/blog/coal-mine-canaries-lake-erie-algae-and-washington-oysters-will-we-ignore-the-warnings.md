Last Saturday, I was helping my son move to a new job in Wisconsin. We spent the night in a motel just outside Toledo and woke to find that we couldn’t take showers, brush our teeth or have a cup of coffee. We were hardly alone. Roughly [500,000 people in Toledo, Ohio](http://www.vox.com/2014/8/3/5963645/a-toxic-algae-bloom-has-left-400000-people-in-ohio-without-drinking) and surrounding suburbs also woke to hear that they should not drink the water, as it might be toxic. Even washing might cause skin rashes and itching. An algal bloom in Lake Erie, from which Toledo gets is water, created toxins which made the water unsafe for drinking, cooking or even bathing. [The water ban lasted for more than two days](http://wdtn.com/2014/08/04/latest-water-tests-show-some-toxins-remain-in-toledo/), and has still not been lifted in some neighborhoods.

The problem is not new. This sort of algal bloom has been going on in Lake Erie for years. This year’s bloom is actually smaller than last year’s. Unfortunately, wind and weather blew it closer to the water intake suctions this year than last. The cause is also no surprise. The yearly blooms are caused by ever larger quantities of phosphorus washing into the lake by manure and chemical fertilizer from farms, along with outflow from sewage treatment plants. Leaky septic tanks and stormwater drains add to the problem. The amount of phosphorus going into the lake has risen every year since the mid-1990s. Last year, [one township just east of Toledo with 2,000 residents](http://www.npr.org/2014/08/04/337712943/toledo-water-ban-persists-after-new-test-results-cause-concerns) was hit by toxic algal contamination. This year, the figure was a half million and the city appears to have no real plan to prevent a future occurrence.

As reported by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/us/lifting-ban-toledo-says-its-water-is-safe-to-drink-again.html): *Algae fed by phosphorus runoff from mid-America farms helped create an oxygen-free dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico last summer that was nearly as big as New Jersey. The Chesapeake Bay regularly struggles with a similar problem.*

[Algal blooms are also common in the western end of Long Island Sound](http://coastalscience.noaa.gov/news/habs/new-york-shellfish-biotoxin-closures-follow-prediction-of-early-onset-of-harmful-algal-blooms-in-long-island-sound/), where blooms have created oxygen-free “dead zones.”.  As the algal blooms took place in salt water, they did not threaten the local water supply.  Nevertheless, toxins from the algae poisoned the local shellfish.

On the West Coast, oysters, particularly those in Washington State, are in peril due to ocean acidification.  [Washington State Governor Jay Inslee recently said](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/us/as-oysters-die-climate-policy-goes-on-stump.html), “It used to be the canary in the coal mine, Now it’s the oyster in the half shell. You can’t overstate what this means to Washington.”

Coal miners used to carry canaries into the mines because the canaries died in the in the presence of dangerous gases. The canaries provided an early warning before the gases became lethal to the miners themselves.  Today the oceans are in trouble due to the effects of pollution and climate change.  The real question is — will we head the warnings in time?  Are dying oysters like a canary in the coal mine? Will we take action against ocean acidiification or will we simply watch as shellfish and coral reefs die?  Will a half million people without safe water around Toledo be a call to action to limit lake pollution or is this just the preview of worse to come?
