HMS Invincible

Last November, we [posted about the sale by tender](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/27/hms-invincible-for-sale-the-perfect-holiday-gift/), through an internet site, of the aircraft carrier *HMS Invincible.* The highest bidder was a Turkish scrapper.

*Leyal Ship Recycling, which is based near Izmir, was chosen ahead of a bid by a UK-based Chinese businessman.*  
  
*Lam Kin-bong – who owns restaurants in the West Midlands – had offered £5m and wanted to turn the former warship into an international school in China.*

*But a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “After 25 years of service HMS Invincible was decommissioned nearly six years ago and having reached the end of her distinguished career, it is right that we secure a good financial return for the taxpayer.*

*“The bid from Leyal Ship Recycling does this and also ensures she is disposed of in an environmentally friendly way.”*
