In case you missed the lunar eclipse early this morning, [visible from 2AM to 6:30AM Pacific time](http://www.griffithobs.org/events/Lunar_Eclipse_April_2015.html), here is the four hour eclipse in one minute,courtesy of the Los Angeles’ [Griffith Observatory](http://www.griffithobservatory.org/about/griffithobservatory.html). Thanks to Phil Leon for passing it along. By the way, if you grew up watching the American TV series, [The Adventures of Superman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Superman_\(TV_series\)), produced between 1952-1958, the “Metropolis Observatory” often featured in the program was the Griffith Observatory.
