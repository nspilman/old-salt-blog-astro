*Wubbo Ockels, a former Dutch astronaut, says he is convinced his sailing yacht [Ecolution](http://www.ecolutions.nl/index_eng.php), which was sunk by unknown assailants earlier this week, will soon be repaired, so he can continue his sustainable energy campaign. Mr Ockels has since received thousands of messages of support.*  
  
*“All the sponsors have reacted in a positive way. They won’t stop us, they said. Rabobank has told us the ship is well insured”, Mr Ockels told Radio Netherlands Worldwide.*

*All electrical systems and electronics have been flooded and have to be replaced, Mr Ockels says. It means the ship’s interior has to be dismantled. The Ecolution has now been pumped out and is floating again. Experts are assessing the damage. The ship costs four million euros.*

*On Thursday, Mr Ockels announced a 5,000 euro award for information leading to those who sank the ship. He is particularly anxious to know the reasons behind the sabotage. He refused to speculate on whether those behind it oppose the sustainable energy movement.*

*Police is now questioning residents of the area where the ship is moored. Mr Ockels says he has received thousands of messages of support. “The only good thing is that sustainable Holland is now more determined than ever to face down non-sustainable Holland.”*
