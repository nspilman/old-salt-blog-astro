The expedition cruise ship, [*Le Boreal*, operated by French line Ponant](http://cruises.com/antarctica/ships/luxury-expedition-ships/le-boreal?mm_campaign=485D87F841FB2962CDAE4DA47CAA0F31&keyword=%2Ble%20%2Bboréal&utm_source=Google&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=Ships%20\(Antarctica\)%20-%20Broad&gclid=Cj0KEQiAg7ayBRD8qqSGt-fj6uYBEiQAucjOwUBVWmRVbReUFlWpyrHQkwritg09Wi-Udx2bwuAMKbcaAqHD8P8HAQ), has been evacuated after a fire in the engine room.  Fire broke out on the 264-passenger ship as she was sailing off the Falkland Islands early Wednesday.  The passengers were transferred to a sister ship, *L’Austral*, which was nearby. They will be taken to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands to be sent home. The remainder of the cruise has been cancelled. *Le Boreal* was built in 2011 by Fincantieri.

This is only the latest in a series of engine room fires on modern diesel-electric powered cruise ships. In September, an [engine room fire broke out on the *Carnival Liberty*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/09/engine-room-on-carnival-liberty-cuts-short-trip-chronic-cruise-ship-problem-continues/) after docking in St. Thomas.  Royal Caribbean’s *[Freedom of the Seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Freedom_of_the_Seas)* experienced a [machinery space fire while entering the Port of Falmouth, Jamaica](http://abcnews.go.com/International/royal-caribbean-cruise-ship-catches-fire-mid-trip/story?id=32622953)  in July. Another Royal Caribbean ship, *[Jewel of the Seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Jewel_of_the_Seas)*, had a [small fire in February](http://www.cruiselawnews.com/tags/cruise-ship-fire/) resulting in the ship having no air conditioning for 5 hours and no toilets for at least two.

The [*Carnival Triumph* suffered an engine room fire in February 2013](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/02/carnival-triumph-another-blacked-out-drifting-cruise-ship-why-again-a-common-design-flaw-in-modern-cruise-ships/) in the Gulf of Mexico and had to be towed to Mobile, Alabama.  On May 14, 2011, an [electrical on failure on the cruise ship *MSC Opera*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/01/the-voyage-of-the-msc-opera-blackout-mutiny-high-drama-on-the-baltic/) cruising in the Baltic, blacked out the ship leaving her drifting for almost three days before tugs arrived and towed her into the Swedish port of Nynashamn near Stockholm.  On November 8, 2010, [a fire in the engine room on the *Carnival Splendor*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/08/carnival-splendor-catches-fire-off-mexico-ship-dead-in-the-water/) while cruising in the Pacific off Mexico blacked out the ship and left her drifting without power for four days until she could be towed to San Diego.

Each of theses ships were relatively new and modern designs, powered by diesel electric propulsion systems, with two engine rooms which should have provided significant redundancy to prevent a single fire from backing out a ship.  Nevertheless, the ships were left blacked out and drifting at sea. Only following a fire on the [*MV Azamara Quest*  was the crew able to restore electricity and propulsion](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/03/fire-on-the-mv-azamara-quest-only-the-latest-failure-on-modern-diesel-electric-cruise-ships/) to the ship following an engine room fire.
