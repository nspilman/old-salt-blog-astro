The *[Columbia](https://shipwiki.wikispaces.com/Columbia)* of 1923 was a fishing schooner built at the Arthur Dana Story shipyard in Essex, MA, from a [design by Starling Burgess](http://modelshipbuilder.com/page.php?28). She was famous for her speed and seaworthiness and for winning international schooner races, including one against *[Bluenose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluenose).* *Columbia* was lost with all hands in a hurricane off Sable Island, Nova Scotia in 1927.

The [*Columbia*](http://www.oceannavigator.com/October-2013/Schooner-Columbia/) of 2014 was recently launched at [Eastern Shipbuilding](http://www.easternshipbuilding.com/) in Panama City, FL. The 141 foot long schooner was also built to the same design as her namesake, although the new *Columbia* is built as a yacht rather than as a fisherman and of steel rather than wood. Burgess’ plans were adapted for steel construction by [Gilbert Associates](http://www.jwgainc.com/), naval architects in Boston.  Columbia will continue to undergo outfitting and begin sailing trials. She will also be exhibited at the [Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show](http://www.showmanagement.com/fort_lauderdale_international_boat_show/event/) October 30th – November 3rd, 2014.
