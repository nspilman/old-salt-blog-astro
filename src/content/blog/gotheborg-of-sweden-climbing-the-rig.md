Sailing onboard [Götheborg of Sweden](https://www.gotheborg.se/) involves climbing and working in the rig, at the highest about 40 meters up, or far out on a yard. Everyone who sails with the ship goes through rig training, and even though most are a bit nervous, to begin with, it soon becomes one of the favorite tasks for many on board. This short film clip is footage from the midship watch on the sailing leg from Stockholm to Gothenburg in September 2021.
