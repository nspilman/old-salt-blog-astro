![AP-Cuba-Swimming-to-Florida](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/09/AP-Cuba-Swimming-to-Florida.jpg)[Diana Nyad](http://www.diananyad.com/) has succeeded in swimming the 110 miles from Cuba to Key West, FL, across the Straits of Florida.  She is the first person ever to do so without a shark cage.  The swim took 53 hours and she emerged from the water on a Key West beach at 2PM, dazed, sunburned and swollen.  Her message to her waiting supporters was to never give up.  Ms. Nyad is 64 years old and this is her fifth attempt to swim the passage. Prior attempts were thwarted by winds and currents, mechanical failure on support boats and by severe jellyfish stings.
