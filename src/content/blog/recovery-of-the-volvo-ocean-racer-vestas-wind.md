![vestaswindship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vestaswindship.jpg)In the end of November, the [Team Vestas Wind](http://www.teamvestaswind.vestas.com/), racing in the [Volvo Ocean Race](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/home.html), [ran aground on a reef](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/11/team-vesta-wind-runs-aground-on-mauritius-reef-in-volvo-ocean-race/) in the remote [Cargados Carajos archipelago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Brandon) about 430 km to the northeast of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.  There were no injuries and the crew was rescued and taken to Mauritius. Before leaving, the crew and their support team promised to return to remove the Volvo 65 racing yacht from the reef.  Given the remoteness of the archipepelago, no doubt many thought that this might be a promise unkept. Nevertheless, 24 days after the grounding, the Vestas Wind team successfully re-floated the yacht and arranged for a gear Maersk container ship to come hoist the wreck aboard.  An impressive accomplishment to be sure.  Click on the link below for a video of the salvage.
