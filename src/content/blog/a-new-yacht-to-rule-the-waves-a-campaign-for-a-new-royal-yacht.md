[A yacht to rule the waves! Two weeks ago the Mail launched a campaign for a new Royal Yacht. Here we unveil the truly majestic blueprint](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2060561/A-yacht-rule-waves-Two-weeks-ago-Mail-launched-campaign-new-Royal-Yacht-Here-unveil-truly-majestic-blueprint.html)

Since 1660, Great Britain has had 83 royal yachts.  The last was the [HMY](http://www.royalyachtbritannia.co.uk/history) *[Britannia](http://www.royalyachtbritannia.co.uk/history),* built at [John Brown’s Clydebank Shipyard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_%26_Company) and delivered in 1954.  She was retired in 1997 and thus far there are no plans to build another.  Recently the British newspaper the Daily Mail announced a new campaign to build a 21st-century successor to the *Britannia.*  This weekend they posted an interesting, if slightly fanciful, artist’s representation of a proposed replacement yacht.  Interestingly enough, the proposed yacht is a four masted square-rigged barque, with solar cells incorporated into the sails, a heli-pad, a mini-sub and and an underwater laboratory.  In these days of austerity, the plan is to build the ship from private donations and have her pay her way by using the vessel for trade shows and training cadets. The drawing of the proposed ship is a bit of a cartoon but is fun to consider, neevrtheless. Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.php) for passing the article along.
