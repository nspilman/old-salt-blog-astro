![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/05/robertsmalls.jpg)On May 13, 1862, [Robert Smalls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smalls), a 23-year-old slave, who served as the pilot of the Confederate armed transport, [CSS *Planter*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Planter_\(1862\)), seized the steamer, sailed it out past the batteries and forts of Charleston harbor and turned it over to the Union naval blockade. [Smalls would go on to become the first black captain of a U.S. Navy vessel](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/02/remembering-robert-smalls-slave-captain-planter-first-black-captain-us-navy-congressman/), a South Carolina State Legislator, a Major General in the South Carolina Militia, a five-term U.S. Congressman and a U.S. Collector of Customs. 

Smalls’ daring hijacking of the CSS *Planter*, sailing directly beneath the guns of Fort Sumter, showed both considerable skill as a pilot, as well as nerves of steel. It is the sort of tale that often inspires the comment, “Someone should make a movie about that.”  With luck, now they will. [Last month it was announced](https://www.thewrap.com/charles-burnett-amazon-steal-away-robert-smalls/) that Charles Burnett, director of the classic film “Killer of Sheep,” will develop a new film with Amazon called “Steal Away,” about the true story of Robert Smalls. 

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/charles-burnett-amazon-steal-away-robert-smalls/) reports that this is Burnett’s first film project since receiving the Governors’ Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences last year. Two of his films, “Killer of Sheep” and “To Sleep With Anger,” have been added to the Library of Congress’ National Film Registry. Cotty Chubb and George Plamondon will produce the film, with Andy Froemke writing the script.
