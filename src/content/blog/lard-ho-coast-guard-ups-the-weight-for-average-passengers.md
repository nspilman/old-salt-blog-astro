[Lard ahoy! Coast Guard estimates average weight of cruise passengers has gone up by 25lbs to 185lbs](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1381337/Lard-ahoy-Coast-Guard-estimates-weight-cruise-passengers-gone-25lbs-185lbs.html)  
  
*‘People have just gotten heavier,’ Coast Guard spokeswoman Lisa Novak told the Los Angeles Times.*

*The new rule means boats will be able to carry fewer people. Otherwise, according to the Coast Guard, they might tip over.*

*For example, under the old measure, a boat with a 16,000-pound capacity could handle 100 passengers. Under the new 185-pounds-per- passenger rule, that vessel could only carry 86 people.*

*The regulations don’t cover recreational boats or cruise ship lifeboats, but tour operators said it will affect their business.*

*‘If you’re licensed for 400 people, with the new rating you may only carry 370,’ Haley Sofge, a manager with Biscayne Lady Charters, which operates out of West Palm Beach and Miami, told the Sun-Sentinel.*

*Another Florida tour boat owner says to make up for fewer passengers operators may have to charge guests more.*

*The Coast Guard used statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reach their weight standards.*

*According to the CDC, for people over age 20, the average weight for men is 194.7 pounds and for women 164.7 pounds.*
