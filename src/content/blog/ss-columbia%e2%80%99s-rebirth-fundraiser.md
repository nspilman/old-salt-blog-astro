![c-in-her-prime](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/c-in-her-prime.jpg)*SS Columbia*, built in 1902, is the oldest surviving passenger steam vessel in the United States. The [SS Columbia Project](http://sscolumbia.org/) is dedicated to restoring and operating the classic passenger steamer.  They are holding their first official fundraising event tommorrow featuring a cruise on the Detroit River on board the *M.V. Friendship*.  Complimentary pizza, delivered by the *J.W. Westcott II* mailboat, will be served and a cash bar will be available.

From the [SS Columbia Project](http://sscolumbia.org/) :  
  
The National Historic Landmark (NHL) vessel *SS Columbia* is a highly important and endangered cultural resource. She is now the oldest surviving passenger steam vessel in the United States, and the best remaining work by one of America’s greatest naval architects, Frank Kirby.

Built in 1902, the *Columbia* combines a spectacular array of design, engineering, and aesthetic innovations. At 207’ in length and 60’ in breadth, the ship was designed to carry 3,200 passengers comfortably on her five decks. Her beautiful interiors were created in collaboration with the painter and designer Louis O. Keil. The ship is adorned with mahogany paneling, etched and leaded glass, gilded moldings, a grand staircase, and an innovative open-air ballroom. The *Columbia*’s massive 1,200-horsepower triple-expansion reciprocating steam engine, surrounded by viewing galleries, will become an unforgettable demonstration of early steam technologies for visitors. Laid up and minimally maintained for the past 15 years, the ship has suffered an accelerating decline in her condition.

The restoration and adaptive re-use of the *SS Columbia* will be one of the most challenging maritime preservation projects yet undertaken in the United States. The planned restoration must result in a vessel that will have multiple usages including as an interpreted exhibit, an active passenger vessel, and an events venue.
