You can’t make this stuff up.  A container ship owner and ship manager are suing a California pharmacy for selling prescription drugs to a harbor pilot prior to an allision with a bridge five years ago.

On a very foggy morning in November 2007, the container ship M/V *Cosco Busan,* outbound from Oakland, struck the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, ripping a 212-foot-long by 10-foot-high by 8-foot-deep gash in side of the ship in way of two fuel oil tanks, spilling over 1,250 barrels of oil.   The [National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that one cause](http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2009/MAR0901.pdf) of the allision was the “the pilot’s degraded cognitive performance from his use of impairing prescription medications.”

The pilot, Captain John Joseph Cota, was sufficiently impaired by prescription drugs that he could not read the ship’s radar, nor effectively communicate with the ship’s officers. (Language issues also contributed to the failures in communication.)  Captain Cota was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison for negligence.

The total cost of the environmental cleanup from the spill was roughly $70 million.  Ultimately, the ship owner, [Regal Stone Ltd. and the ship manager, Fleet Management Ltd., agreed to pay](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/September/11-enrd-1209.html) a total of $44 million dollars for their part in the oil spill.

Now, in an attempt to recover some those millions,  Regal Stone Ltd. and Fleet Management Ltd.have filed a lawsuit against Longs Drug Store in Petaluma, arguing that the pills dispensed by pharmacists at a Longs Drug Store in Petaluma clouded pilot John Cota’s judgment and led the ship to slam into the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

Thanks to Phil Leon for passing the story along.
