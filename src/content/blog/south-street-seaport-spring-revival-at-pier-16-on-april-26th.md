If you are in the New York area on Saturday, April 26th, be sure to stop by the [South Street Seaport](http://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/) to celebrate a Spring revival with the grand reopening of Pier 16 and the Street of Ships.

[Capt. Jonathan Boulware](http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Captain-s-Log---Spring-Revival-on-Pier-16.html?soid=1109032176127&aid=vM9XXUjTTuE), Interim President of the South Street Seaport Museum writes:

*Please join us on April 26th as we take one in a series of steps to revitalize and grow this important institution: the grand re-opening of Pier 16 and the Street of Ships. A very special bell-ringing ceremony and remarks will be at 2pm, but please join us at any time from 12-5 that day. Board PEKING, PIONEER, W. O. DECKER, and AMBROSE.*

*Visit the Bowne shops at Water Street. Join Seaport staff, members, and volunteers who for decades have worked to preserve and fortify this special piece of old New York-the Street of Ships: Where New York Begins-and help to celebrate and kick off a season of celebration and preservation of not just maritime New York, but of New York itself.* 

*See you on the 26th!*
