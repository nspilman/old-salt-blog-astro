USS Little Rock

[USNI News](https://news.usni.org/2022/03/29/all-freedom-littoral-combat-ships-in-commission-tapped-for-early-disposal) reports that the nine [Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom-class_littoral_combat_ship) (LCS) currently in Navy service – the youngest of which commissioned in 2020 – have been marked for disposal as part of the Department of Defense’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget proposal.

The ships – USS *Fort Worth* (LCS-3), USS *Milwaukee* (LCS-5), USS *Detroit* (LCS-7), USS *Little Rock* (LCS-9), USS *Sioux City* (LCS-11), USS *Wichita* (LCS-13), USS *Billings* (LCS-15), and USS *St. Louis* (LCS-19) – are part of the 24 ships the service has chosen to [decommission in FY 2023](https://news.usni.org/2022/03/28/fy-23-budget-navy-wants-to-shed-24-ships-for-3-6b-in-savings-over-next-five-years) for an estimated $3.6 billion in savings.

In the Navy’s last plan for the Littoral Combat Ship program, the Freedom-class ships had been tapped to shoulder the anti-submarine warfare role with the LCS ASW mission package. The towed variable depth low-frequency active sonar (VDS) didn’t perform properly, so the ships were left without a mission, in addition to propulsion plant problems that have plagued the Freedom-class ships.

The Navy intends to take the remaining six Freedom-class ships under construction and fit them with a variation of the surface warfare mission package for missions in U.S. Central and Southern commands, a service official told USNI News.

The Navy also plans to decommission another 15 ships during the fiscal year, USN officials said during a briefing – five cruisers, four dock-landing ships, two submarines, two oilers, and two expeditionary transfer docks.

Sixteen of the ships, including the LCSs, will require a waiver to be decommissioned before the end of their service lives. Relatively new to the fleet, the ships cost about $500 million per vessel to procure.
