Two years and one month ago today, the *[SV Concordia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordia_\(ship\))*, a school ship operated by [West Island College International](http://www.classafloat.com/), was [knocked down and sank off the coast of Brazil](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/02/19/%E2%80%9Cclass-afloat%E2%80%9D-school-ship-concordia-sinks-off-brazil/).  Fortunately, all 64 passengers and crew aboard were rescued.  The [final report](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/01/the-knockdown-and-capsizing-of-the-sv-concordia-the-official-report/) of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, issued in October of last year, concluded that poor training and operator error contributed to the sinking. Thanks to Wojtek ‘Voytec’ Wacowski, on Facebook, for pointing out the anniversary.
