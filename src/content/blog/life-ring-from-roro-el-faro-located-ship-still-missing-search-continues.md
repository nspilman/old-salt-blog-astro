![liferingelfaro](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/10/liferingelfaro.jpg)***Update**:* [From USCG Update 4](http://www.uscgnews.com/go/doc/4007/2607474/) — Life jackets, life rings, containers and an oil sheen have been located by Coast Guard aircrews.  The objects have not been confirmed to be from the El Faro at this time.

Yesterday, the [US Coast Guard found a life ring from the *El Faro*](http://www.detroitnewstime.com/regional/103890-el-faro-cargo-ship-life-ring-spotted-by-us-coast-guard-airplane.html), a ro/ro cargo ship bound from Jacksonville to Puerto Rico, which disappeared last Thursday in the path of Hurricane Joaquin. In a [statement released last night, Tim Nolan, president of TOTE Maritime, the ship’s operator, said:](http://www.scribd.com/doc/283568153/TOTE-Maritime-PR-Release-on-Life-Ring-10-3-15-830pm-EST#)

*“Earlier today, the Coast Guard confirmed that they located a life ring floating at sea which was identified as belonging to the EL Faro. A HC130 plane spotted the ring and a H60 helicopter confirmed it was able to retrieve the ring and the ring was stenciled with markings from the El Faro.*

*While this reflects that the ship was caught in rough seas and extreme weather, it is in no way indicative of the ship’s fate. In fact, it helps confirm the El Faro’s possible location and helps the USCG confirm the search areas. Small items, such as life rings and life jackets, are lost at sea frequently, particularly in rough weather.*

*The US Coast Guard has been working tirelessly, allocating numerous air and surface assets to aid in the search. They will be announcing search plans for Sunday in due course.”*
