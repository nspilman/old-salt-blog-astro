We have [previously posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/08/land-and-sea-nova-scotia-schooners-on-line-now/) about the CBC’s “[Land and Sea](http://www.cbc.ca/landandsea/),”  a program which for thirty years has been focussed on stories from people who live off the land and the sea on the Canadian Atlantic. In December, they featured a wonderful documentary on [Nova Scotia Schooners](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/04/land-and-sea-nova-scotia-schooners/).  This Sunday, February 19th, Land & Sea will broadcast [Rum Running](https://www.facebook.com/events/270476169690052/), a documentary by [Tell Tale Productions](http://www.telltale.tv/home.html), which looks fascinating.

[Rum Running](https://www.facebook.com/events/270476169690052/), “*reveals how thousands of law abiding citizens of Atlantic Canada were lured into the alcohol smuggling trade during Prohibition in the 1920’s and 30s. Prohibition was extremely unpopular with many Americans and Canadians, but for dozens of coastal communities in Atlantic Canada hard hit by a downturn in the fisheries and still recovering from World War I, it was seen as a golden business opportunity.*  *Rum Running depicts the larger than life characters and the high stakes role that Nova Scotia and the French Islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon played during the era. The film explores the social, economic, and cultural impact that this illegal activity had on dozens of coastal communities and reveals how the impact of rum running still affects us today*.”
