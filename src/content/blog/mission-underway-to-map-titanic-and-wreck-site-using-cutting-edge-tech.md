Just over a year after the [ill-fated *Titan* expedition](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2023/06/debris-found-from-submersible-titan-five-onboard-believed-to-have-died-in-catastrophic-implosion/) to the *Titanic* killed five people, another expedition down to one of the most famous shipwrecks in the world is underway. Using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), a team of imaging experts, scientists, and historians plans to get updated images of the *Titanic* that will be used to make a 3D model of the ship. [RMS Titanic Inc.](https://www.discovertitanic.com/) – the only firm with salvage rights to the wreck – will carry out the mission.

This is [RMS Titanic, Inc.’s first expedition to the wreck site](https://expedition.discovertitanic.com/) since 2010. The expedition will utilize cutting-edge technology to focus on imaging and high-resolution photography of the site to preserve the *Titanic*’s legacy for future generations and scientific study. ROVs will survey the wreck site and debris field. The images captured will reveal important new insights into the condition of the site, areas, and artifacts at risk, and contribute to ongoing conservation efforts and educational initiatives already underway.

The firm describes the mission of the Titanic Expedition 2024 as utilizing the latest technology to continue the important work of surveying the *Titanic* wreck site, enhancing their understanding of its historical significance, identifying at risk artifacts for safe recovery in future expeditions, protecting and conserving the area for future generations, furthering the current scientific study, engaging a world-wide community in discovering and identifying new artifacts and marine life never before seen, and inspiring the next generation of explorers.

While the remains of the ship have been reasonably well documented, the huge debris field around the wreckage remains relatively unexplored. So, the two ROVs will not only photograph the ship itself, but also explore a roughly one kilometre-squared section of the seafloor using ultra-high-definition cameras with a special lighting system and a lidar – light detection and ranging – laser scanner.

The mission also marks the first time a magnetometer has been used around the wreckage. The instrument, which detects metals, will be able to look into the seabed.

RMS Titanic Inc. says their crew will hold a memorial service for those who died in the *Titan* submersible, as well as the 1,500 who perished when the *Titanic* sank. One of the five who died on the *Titan* submersible was Frenchman Paul-Henri (“PH”) Nargeolet. He was the director of research at RMS Titanic Inc. and was due to lead this expedition.
