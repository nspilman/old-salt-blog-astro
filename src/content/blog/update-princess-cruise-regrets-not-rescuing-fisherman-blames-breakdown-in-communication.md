![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/princess_logo.jpg)[Princess Cruises](http://www.princess.com/) said it deeply regrets that its ship the [*Star Princess*](http://www.princess.com/learn/ships/tp/) passed by a fishing boat adrift in the Pacific Ocean and failing to rescue the dying men on board. The cruise line is blaming a “breakdown in communication,” claiming that the captain and the officer on watch were never contacted about the disabled fishing boat. Passengers on deck spotted the fishing boat in distress and relayed the information to a sales representative on the ship, who promised to pass the information onto the bridge. By the time the fishing boat was ultimately rescued several weeks later, two of the three fishermen aboard had died.
