Spotted Dick

The Aubrey/Maturin series of novels by Patrick O’Brian introduced the world to, among other things,  a range of obscure traditional British cuisine, which notably included suet puddings such as “Floating Island”, the unappetizing “Drowned Baby” and the perennial favorite “Spotted Dick”.   This week at a Flintshire council canteen in the UK, the traditional suet pudding “Spotted Dick” has been renamed “Spotted Richard” – because customers keep making jokes about the name.  [Outrage has ensued](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2627503.ece).

[As reported by the Sun](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2627503.ece):  
  
*Peter Henderson, chairman of the Pudding Club, said:  “This is absolutely ridiculous. The name Spotted Dick is completely harmless and it’s been part of the English language for years.  If we remove every last trace of humour from the workplace we might as well go around with our mouths zipped up from nine to five.”*
