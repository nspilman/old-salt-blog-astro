The Wall Street Journal is reporting that an agreement has been reached between [Norwegian Cruise Line](http://www2.ncl.com/) and the [SS United States Conservancy](http://ssunitedstatesconservancy.org/SSUS/blog/), a preservationist group, to save the [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States)*[SS United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States)* from the scrap yard.    The Conservancy is reported to have agreed to pay NCL $3 million dollars for the ship. It has also been reported that NCL had received an almost $6 million dollar offer from a scrap yard but had agreed to work with the Conservancy instead.   The offer by the Conservancy was made possible by a reported $5.8 million pledge by Philadelphia philanthropist H.F. “Gerry” Lenfest.

The *[SS United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States)* was the fastest passenger liner ever built.
