[‘We’ve just scratched the surface’: Divers find ‘oldest shipwreck in the Caribbean’…. and treasure that could be worth MILLIONS](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1381334/Divers-unearth-treasure-shipwreck-believed-oldest-Caribbean.html)

*A chance encounter with a fisherman has led one team of treasure hunters to discover what they believe is the oldest shipwreck in the Caribbean.*  
  
*At the last count Captain Billy Rawson and his crew had uncovered 700 silver coins that could be worth millions, jade figurines and even a mirrored stone that was possibly used in Shamanic rituals.*

*They had been surveying 42 miles of coastline with high-tech equipment in an effort to find the wreck.*

*But they got lucky after the chance encounter with a local fisherman who sold them an old coin he had found while diving.  
*

*To their astonishment the team discovered it was one of the oldest coins ever minted and knew they had found what they were looking for.*

*‘We said to this guy: “If you show us where you found the coin you can come and work for us”,’ said Mr Champion.*

*The team are planning another dive in two weeks but it is a gruelling process as the wreck is covered in sand and coral.  
*

*It takes them 12 hours to sail around the island to the dive site. They then drop anchor and take smaller boats out to dive from.*
