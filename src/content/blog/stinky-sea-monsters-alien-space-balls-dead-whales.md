Every![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/seamcarcass.jpg) now and then, the stories of sea monsters take a physical form when a huge, decaying carcass of what appears to be a monster from the deep washes ashore. Such a creature came ashore on Seram Island in Indonesia’s Maluku province in May. Initially, [the 50-foot-long body was said to be a giant squid](http://jakartaglobe.id/news/dead-giant-squid-washes-up-on-seram-island-in-maluku/) but the appearance of bones from the decomposing and incredibly smelly corpse allowed scientists to identify the creature as a [dead and rotting baleen whale.](https://www.livescience.com/59098-decomposed-sea-monster-just-a-whale.html) The scientists are unsure whether the whale was a blue, a Bryde’s whale or possibly a fin whale.

![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/alienspaceball.jpg)About a year ago, [fisherman from Bunbury, near Perth, Australia](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3714611/Fishermen-spot-alien-like-inflated-whale-carcass-gets-devoured-sharks-coast-Bunbury-near-Perth.html) saw what appeared to be some sort of alien sphere floating on the surface. At first they thought that it might be a stranded hot air balloon but on closer examination saw that is was very strange indeed. From the photograph I was reminded of a 1957 sci-fi move, “[The Brain from Planet Arous.”](http://www.badmovies.org/movies/brainarous/brainarous2.jpg)

When the fisherman came closer and had a a different perspective on the object, they could see that it was not an alien space ball but instead a dead baleen whale, bloated with gas.
