Team Hallin - Fully Clothed

Ocean rowing has got to be one of the most physically demanding of all sports.  In addition to the physical labor of fighting the wind and seas, salt water sores and chafing are reported to be a big problem.   In 2009 in the Indian Ocean Rowing Race, one four woman team, the [Ocean Angels, attempted to row nude](http://yachtpals.com/rowing-naked-4157) whenever possible in an attempt to avoid saltwater sores caused by rubbing against clothes after days of rowing.  
  
There is also a problem unique to male rowers, usually referred to euphemistically as “*salt sores in the nether regions, a problem unique to male rowers and one that always generates interesting discussions on the prevention and treatment of such localised sores.*”   (See [Hormonal Women, Full Moons and Intimate Sores](http://yachtpals.com/rowing-4145))   This may have been an issue on the recent record breaking row by Team Hallin.   The one female crew member, Naomi Hoogesteger,  is quoted as remarking that she had seen ‘*enough male dangly bits to last a lifetime*.’

*Naomi Hoogesteger said she and the five men on board the trimaran were left with no choice.*

*‘The blisters and sores on our backsides were bad and becoming infected,’ said the 29-year-old Durham University lecturer.*

*‘The only way we could treat them and continue rowing was to expose them to sun and air.*

*‘It was a bit more embarrassing for me as the only woman.’*
