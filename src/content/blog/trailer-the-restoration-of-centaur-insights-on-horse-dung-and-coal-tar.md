[*Centaur*](https://www.bargetrust.org/barges/centaur/) is one of three sailing barges owned and operated by the [Thames Sailing Barge Trust](https://www.bargetrust.org/). Launched in  February 1895 at John and Herbert Cann’s Bathside yard in Harwich, *Centaur* was built as a coasting barge – able to trade all around the British coast and to the near continent.

In the most recent restoration of the historic barge, filmmaker Simon North shot a documentary of the process, ‘[The Restoration of Centaur](https://www.bargetrust.org/product/the-restoration-of-centaur-dvd/)‘. Here is a short video that highlights the traditional, but certainly new to me, use of horse dung and coal tar in replanking the barge. Thanks to David Rye for passing it along.
