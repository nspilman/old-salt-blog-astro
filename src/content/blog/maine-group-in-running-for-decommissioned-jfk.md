A follow-up to our previous post  –  [Free Aircraft Carrier – ex USS John F Kennedy](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/11/23/free-aircraft-carrier-ex-uss-john-f-kennedy-available-for-donation-to-appropriate-group/).

[Maine group in running for decommissioned JFK](http://www.navytimes.com/news/2010/02/ap_carrier_kennedy_maine_020310/)

*A nonprofit group in Maine says it’s still in the running to bring the decommissioned carrier John F. Kennedy to Portland Harbor as a floating museum.*

*The USS John F. Kennedy Museum said Wednesday that the Navy has invited it to enter into the next phase to land the 1,052-foot aircraft carrier. According to the group, the Navy said only two organizations made it to the next stage, but didn’t reveal the other group.*  
  
*The Kennedy was removed from service in 2007. The Navy is making it available for use as a museum or memorial.*

*The Maine group says the ship would be a tourist draw and preserve a piece of history. Critics say Portland is ill-equipped to take on such a massive project.*
