First it was the White House Easter Egg Hunt – cancelled due to the sequestration. Now it appears that Navy Fleet Weeks in ports around the country, traditionally held each spring, may fall victim to the automatic budget cuts as well. The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/nyregion/fleet-week-is-threatened-by-federal-budget-cuts.html?hp) is reporting that Fleet Week this year in New York harbor will be “significantly reduced if it occurs at all.” On Thursday, Rear Admiral John Kirby, a Navy spokesman, said that “*no branch of the armed forces may participate in community relations or outreach events that come at additional cost to government or rely on anything other than local assets and personnel. We will follow that direction, to include participation in Fleet Weeks*.”

[There are also reports that no Navy ships will participate in Fleet Week in Portland, OR](http://www.koin.com/2013/04/09/no-navy-ships-for-2013-portland-fleet-week/), from June 5 through June 9, though Coast Guard, Army and Canadian navy vessels may make an appearance. Likewise there will be no Navy ships at [Seattle’s Fleet Week](http://westseattleblog.com/2013/04/another-seafair-update-no-u-s-navy-fleet-this-year-either). The same appears to be the case in [Fort Lauderdale](http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-04-09/news/fl-fleet-week-cancelled-20130409_1_fleet-week-navy-spokeswoman-suzanne-speight-broward-navy) and possibly [San Francisco](http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/sf-fleet-week-could-be-cancelled-wake-blue-angels-/nXHTh/).  Budget cuts have also grounded the Navy’s precision air squad, the [Blue Angels](http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/09/us/military-air-shows/index.html).

Here is a short video of the New York Fleet Week from two years ago:
