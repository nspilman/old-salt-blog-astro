USCG Canned Meat?

I will admit to doing a double take when I saw the USCG press release announcing “[Coast Guard Cutter Harriet Lane returns home after 9-week patrol](http://www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com/go/doc/651/911095/).”   I wondered, who would name a ship the *Harriet Lane*?  For the record, the [USCGC *Harriet Lane*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Harriet_Lane_\(WMEC-903\)) was named for Harriet Lane, niece and official hostess of President James Buchanan.   The current *Harriet Lane* is also not the first. There was also a  revenue cutter by the same name in 1857.

For those familiar with sailor slang, however, [Harriet Lane is also slang for canned meat](http://books.google.com/books?id=qn-DASgdhiAC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=harriet+lane+murder+victim+meat&source=bl&ots=Kb0G0ANOjI&sig=Yz2wv08K8RzIqHJY78Z9_Mo4Jgw&hl=en&ei=m-akTPT2DcTflgf98o2kCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=harriet%20lane%20murder%20victim%20meat&f=false).   Harriet Lane was a murder victim, who was chopped up by her killer around 1875.   Merchant sailors came to call any canned meat, Harriet Lane.  Fanny Adams, also a long remembered, if also dismembered, murder victim, became Royal Navy slang for tinned meats as well.   To the best of my knowledge, there is no USCG *Fanny Adams*, thank goodness.
