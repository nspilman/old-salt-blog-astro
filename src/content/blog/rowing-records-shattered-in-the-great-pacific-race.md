![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sheroes.jpg)The fourth rowing of the [Great Pacific Race](https://greatpacificrace.com/) has shattered transPacific records. The race departed from the Golden Gate Bridge on May 30, bound for Honolulu. The teams are competing in identical boats, rowing entirely self-supported and unassisted across 2,400 miles of open ocean.

The first to complete the race was team [Latitude 35](https://abc7news.com/rowing-record-sf-hawaii-world-speed-row-crew/10853713/), a four-man team, who arrived after 30 days, breaking the previous record for a crew of four men to row west across the mid-Pacific route by nine days. The team is made up of Jason Caldwell, Angus Collins, Duncan Roy, and Jordan Shuttleworth.

Arriving on July 6th, the team [Ocean Sheroes](https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2021-07-06/all-female-rowing-team-smash-world-record-for-crossing-the-pacific) broke the previous record for a women’s team in the race by a full 14 days. The Ocean Sheroes are also the first all British woman’s team to complete the race. The Ocean Sheroes are Bella Collins, Purusha Gordon, Mary Sutherland, and Lily Lower.

Since its launch in 2014, only 22 teams have ever completed the Great Pacific Race.
