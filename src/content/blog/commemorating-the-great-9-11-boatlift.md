ABOUT THE GREAT BOATLIFT OF 9/11:

*   The “Boatlift” of 9/11 was the largest water evacuation in history. After road, tunnel, and railway closures out of New York City, over half a million people were stranded in lower Manhattan following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.
*   American Maritime transported over 500,000 survivors from lower Manhattan across the harbor to safety and the rescue was larger than the evacuation of 340,000 American-allied troops at Dunkirk.
*   The rescue effort involved over 150 American Maritime vessels, including passenger ferries, tugboats, merchant ships, private vessels, and New York City Fire Department and Police Department boats.
*   More than 800 American mariners participated in the Boatlift evacuation of September 11th.

ROUTE  
The route will include a gathering south of Governor’s Island, a pass by the Statue of Liberty, and then a procession and a pass in front of the World Trade Center site.
