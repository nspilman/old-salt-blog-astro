![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/arasanjuan1.jpg)One year after the submarine [ARA *San* *Juan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_San_Juan_\(S-42\)) [disappeared on a routine mission, with 44 aboard](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/11/argentines-search-missing-submarine-ara-san-juan/), the wreckage of the missing submarine has been [located in 2,600 feet of water in the Atlantic](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/11/17/world/americas/17reuters-argentina-submarine.html). The submarine was located by [Ocean Infinity](https://oceaninfinity.com/), a US company. 

Contact was lost with the submarine on November 15, 2017. The submarine had reported an electrical short following a leak in the vessel’s snorkel. Eight days later, the the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation said that it had detected a [possible explosion](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/11/no-sign-missing-submarine-ara-san-juan-reports-explosion/) a few hours after the sub’s last contact.
