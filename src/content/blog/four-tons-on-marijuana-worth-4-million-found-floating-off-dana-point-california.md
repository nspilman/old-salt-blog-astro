A local boater first spotted the bales floating 15 miles offshore near Point Dana, California.  When law enforcement went out to investigate, they found between 160-180 bales of marijuana (depending on the news report), weighing close to four tons and worth around $4 million dollars, bobbing in the Pacific Ocean.   The Border Patrol described the situation, with admirable understatement, as “unusual.”
