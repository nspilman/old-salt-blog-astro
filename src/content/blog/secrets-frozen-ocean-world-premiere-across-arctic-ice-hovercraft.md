![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/02/hovercraft.jpg)Next Wednesday, March 7th, at 6PM, [Neil and Ariel Weisbrod](https://vimeo.com/user17331159)‘s new documentary, “[Secrets of a Frozen Ocean](http://www.nyciff.com/secrests-of-a-frozen-ocean-documentary)“, will have its world premiere at the New York City International Film Festival at the Producer’s Club 358 W 44th Street, NY, NY 10036.

“Secrets of A Frozen Ocean” follows 75 year old, Yngve Kristoffersen, a Norwegian Scientist who sets out on a dangerous 13 month expedition in a small hovercraft together with Audun Tholfsen. Their destination was the most  remote areas of the Arctic . It is his last chance to fulfill his lifelong dream and prove a theory about an asteroid hitting the Arctic Ocean millions of years ago. Along the way they encounter extreme weather, hungry Polar Bears, and mechanical difficulties. The theory which inspired the expedition was based on data collected by Dr. John K. Hall on the US Ice Station T3 in the late 1960’sThe documentary is a mix of groundbreaking science and wild adventure. 

Last year [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/02/north-mist-hovercraft-arctic-ice/) about the Weisbrod’s fascinating documentary “[North Into the Mist](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/02/north-mist-hovercraft-arctic-ice/)” about Yngve Kristoffersen’s previous expedition on the ice, attempting to prove a theory about an asteroid strike in the Arctic Sea millions of years ago. “Secrets of a Frozen Ocean” picks up where “North Into the Mist” left off.  I am very much looking forward to seeing the new documentary.
