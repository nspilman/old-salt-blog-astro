*The non profit foundation that owns the ship, the Virginia Maritime Heritage Foundation, is carrying $1.6 million in debt. Board members called the ship back from the Caribbean, laid it up and fired most of the paid crew in December when cash ran out.*

*A last-ditch effort between schooner officials and the Nauticus Foundation to get the Virginia sailing again is now under way, but many details remain to be worked out, said Will King, the schooner foundation’s now unpaid executive director.*

*“It’s do-or-die time for the Schooner Virginia,” said Bob Stanton, a longtime board member and founder of a commercial real estate company. “We either come up with a plan to operate it that is financially sensible or we’re going to have to face the ultimate consequence, which is to sell the vessel, pay off the debt, lick our wounds and go home. That is not what we want to do.”*

*If there’s a surprise in this story, it might be that the Virginia didn’t stop sailing earlier. Sluggish private fundraising, a heavy reliance on now dried-up state money and bank loans, a lack of sailing programs that paid the bills, and the sinking economy grounded the Virginia, according to interviews and a review of the ship’s financial records.*

*“It was touch-and-go for years,” said Palmer Rutherford, another longtime board member and retired attorney.*
