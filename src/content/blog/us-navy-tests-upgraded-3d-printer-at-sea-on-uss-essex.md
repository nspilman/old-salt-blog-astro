![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ussessex1.jpg)The [USS *Essex*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Essex_\(LHD-2\)), a Wasp-class Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD), recently loaded a new [15,000-pound 3D printer](https://www.cpf.navy.mil/News/Article/3089322/uss-essex-first-ship-to-participate-in-nps-3d-printer-research/), just prior to departing to participate in the multinational [Rim of the Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_RIMPAC#RIMPAC_2022) exercise underway at Hawaii and California. The amphibious assault ship will be the first to test the new 3D printer during underway conditions at sea.

Unlike previous 3D printers tested by the Navy that print objects using polymers or metal powders, the Xerox ElemX 3D printer uses aluminum wire to create parts and tools. 

Lt. Cmdr. Nicolas Batista, the Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department (AIMD) officer aboard Essex [stated that the new 3D printer is one of the fastest printers](https://www.cpf.navy.mil/News/Article/3089322/uss-essex-first-ship-to-participate-in-nps-3d-printer-research/) on the market, capable of fabricating and printing aluminum up to 10” by 10”. Many common components may be created on the ship to include heat sinks, housings, fuel adapters, bleed air valves, valve covers and more.

The testing of the printer at sea is intended to investigate how well the machinery will perform under maritime conditions. 3D printers are designed to operate on stable platforms and may be impacted by ship motion and vibrations. Likewise, the humidity and potential exposure to salt water may create operational and maintenance issues. 

“This 3D Printer will essentially bridge the gap in some of our supply chain shortfalls by providing organic repair capability in printing much-needed tools and parts, which enhances our capabilities in increasing material readiness in an expedited turnaround time,” Batista said.

“The capabilities of the 3D printer will enable *Essex* to become more self-sufficient,” said Batista. He expressed that innovative operational concepts such as this 3D printing capability will be great additions in the future for every ship.
