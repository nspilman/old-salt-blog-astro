![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/03/lancetfish.jpg)On March 24th, 1945 the *[USS Lancetfish](http://www.facebook.com/notes/submarine-force-museum-and-uss-nautilus/today-in-submarine-force-history/10150218857582729)* was decommissioned after less than thousand hours in service.  She never put to sea under her own power and never had a crew.  Delivered from the Cramp Shipbuilding Company of Philadelphia, she was towed to the Boston Navy Yard for additional work. A shipyard worker opened a torpedo tube door and the sub sank in seven fathoms of water.  She was judged too damaged to be worth repairing and was laid up until 1959 when she was finally sold for scrap.
