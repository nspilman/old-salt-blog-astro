The [Mystic Seaport Museum](http://www.mysticseaport.org/) has posted a fascinating video of the 3D laser scanning of the hold of the whaler [Charles W. Morgan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_W._Morgan_\(ship\)) along with commentary on how they are using the technology to record the original construction details of the historic ship.  Definately worth a look and a listen.
