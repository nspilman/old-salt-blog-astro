![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/01/olympia3.jpg)After a three year bidding process to attempt to find a new home for the [historic cruiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Olympia_\(C-6\)) *[Olympia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Olympia_\(C-6\)),* the [Independence Seaport Museum](http://www.phillyseaport.org/) has [announced that it will keep the ship after all.](http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/04/02/historic-ship-uss-olympia-will-remain-in-philadelphia/)

[Four groups originally bid](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/05/four-groups-vie-for-uss-olympia-custody/) on taking over the ship but none were considered to be viable.  The museum also noted that the ship was responsible for half of the museum’s 70,000 annual visitors. [Museum president John Brady has announced a $20-million national fundraising campaign to support repairs to the cruiser.](http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/04/02/historic-ship-uss-olympia-will-remain-in-philadelphia/)  The museum had previously claimed that it could not afford to keep the historic ship.

Built in 1892, the cruiser *Olympia* was Commodore George Dewey’s flagship at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish-American War in 1898 and is the oldest steel warship afloat. She has been a museum ship in Philadelphia since 1957.  In February of 2010, the Independence Seaport Museum announced that it could not afford to keep the *Olympia.* The [museum suggested that it might sink the ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/05/uss-olympia-to-be-sunk-as-artificial-reef/) as an artificial reef. Fortuitously, the alternative was ruled out because the [museum lack the millions of dollars necessary to dredge around the ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/03/update-ss-olympia-%E2%80%93-stuck-in-philadelphia-by-sandbars-and-scandal/) to allow her to be towed away. The *Olympia* was last drydocked in 1945. In 2010, dredging to move the ship to a drydock was estimated to cost $10 million with another $10 million required to make necessary repairs.
