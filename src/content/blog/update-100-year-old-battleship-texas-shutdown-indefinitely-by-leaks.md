![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/06/bbtexaspump.jpg)We posted recently about the [attempts to repair hull leaks in the Battleship*Texas*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/12/battleship-uss-texas-100-years-old-and-taking-on-water-fast/), the [oldest remaining dreadnought battleship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Texas_\(BB-35\)) and only one of six surviving ships to have served in both World War I and World War II.  The ship has been on exhibit at the [San Jacinto Battlefield State Historic Site](http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/state-parks/san-jacinto-battleground) since 1948. Last Thursday, the ship was pumped out and a patch installed over a 2 in inch hole in the ship. The ship was floating on her lines with no leaks until Saturday night when new leaks, from another area of the ship’s hull, again began flooding the old dreadnought.  The museum ship, which had reopened Saturday, has now been shut down to visitors indefinitely.

[USS Texas springs more leaks; 1,500 gallons per minute leaking](http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/USS-Texas-springs-more-leaks-1-500-gallons-per-3660828.php)  
  
On Saturday night, ship manager Andy Smith said, water gushed through leaks in the ship’s rear port side at a rate of 100 gallons per minute. By Sunday morning, the back third of the ship was flooded to the water line and hard aground.

The adverse developments came just one day after Smith, who manages the vessel for the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife, declared that the main and several smaller leaks had been patched and de-watering operations completed.

On Monday, Smith said workers have found two areas with serious leaks. One consists of three leaks; the second has “a couple of holes, a seam leak and at least three rivet leaks all in the same vicinity,” he said.
