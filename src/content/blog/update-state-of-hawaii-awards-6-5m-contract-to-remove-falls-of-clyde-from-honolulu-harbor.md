The HDOT has not confirmed whether the vessel will be scrapped or sunk and when the work is scheduled to begin.

The process has been long and painful for all concerned.

*Falls of Clyde* is the only surviving iron-hulled four-masted full rigged ship and the only surviving sail-driven oil tanker in the world.  She was launched in 1878 in Port Glasgow, Scotland, for the Fall Line . 

The vessel was purchased by William Matson in the late 19th century and was primarily used to transport goods and people between Hawaii and California. In 1907, it was sold and converted to an oil tanker. It repeatedly changed hands until it was brought back to Honolulu in 1963 as a floating museum next to the Hawaii Maritime Center. 

In 2008, the Bishop Museum, which controlled the ship, was preparing to tow the ship out to sea and scuttle it. In an attempt to save the historic vessel, the [Friends of Falls of Clyde](http://www.friendsoffallsofclyde.org/home), a tax-exempt group, was formed and purchased the ship in September 2008.

The 146-year-old vessel is currently berthed at Pier 7. After decades of corrosion and neglect the HDOT impounded the vessel in 2016 and announced it was seeking bids for its removal in mid-2024. 

The *Falls of Clyde* was listed in the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a National Historic Landmark (NHL). Due to deterioration, it has lost most of the qualities of historic significance and aspects of integrity. In November 2023, it was delisted from the Hawai‘i Register of Historic Places and was subsequently removed from the National Register and lost its NHL status.
