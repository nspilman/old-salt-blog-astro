Mermaid on the Danube

A Viking River Cruises ship, the [*Viking Sigyn*](https://www.vikingrivercruises.com/ships/longships/viking-sigyn.html), collided with a tourist sightseeing boat in the Danube River named *Mermaid* off Budapest on Wednesday night. Of the 33 Korean tourists and two Hungarian crew aboard the sightseeing boat, seven have been rescued, seven have been confirmed dead and 21 are still missing.  

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48468701) reports that CCTV footage showed the boat that sank – Hableany, or Mermaid – being hit from behind by a larger tour boat – Viking Sigyn – near the Margit (Margaret) Bridge in central Budapest after 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT).

The captain of the *Viking Sigyn,* a [64-year-old Ukrainian identified only as Yuriy C](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/30/728229142/tourist-boats-crash-in-hungarys-danube-river-at-least-7-dead). has been taken into custody by Hungarian police, suspected of endangering water transport leading to a deadly mass accident according to a police website.
