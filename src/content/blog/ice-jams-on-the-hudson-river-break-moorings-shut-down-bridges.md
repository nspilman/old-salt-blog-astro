![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/01/shipbridgehudsonice.jpg)No doubt about it. Winter is with us with a vengeance. On Friday rising waters and ice jams on the Hudson River between Albany and Troy, New York tore [eight vessels from their moorings](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/25/688838962/standoff-ends-between-unmanned-cruise-ship-and-railroad-bridge?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20190125&fbclid=IwAR1bfo9vNt-9hAbnWaXMmWuisQTc9kXWYCX-MKKGuO7np0JAOHkvi3bUaPs). Five barges, one tugboat, a “dock system” and a 300′ long cruise ship were set adrift in the current.

The cruise ship, *Captain JP III*, which had been laid up of the winter, drifted into and became jammed underneath a the Livingston Avenue Bridge, a railroad bridge used by Amtrak. A video shows that while jammed beneath the bridge trestle, the ship was nearly hit by a drifting hopper barge, which had also been broken from its moorings by drifting ice. 

One Amtrak train was allowed to proceed to at a walking pace over the railroad bridge while the ship was stuck beneath it. Five highway bridges, however, were forced to shut down during Friday morning commuting hours until the drifting vessels were brought under control.

Two tugboats, the *Francis* and the *Margot*, were ultimately able to dislodge the four decked *Captain JP III* from where it was wedged beneath the railroad bridge. A small fleet of tugboats from Albany was able to round up the remaining drifting barges. New York Department of Environmental Conservation confirms that all drifting vessels have been safely secured.
