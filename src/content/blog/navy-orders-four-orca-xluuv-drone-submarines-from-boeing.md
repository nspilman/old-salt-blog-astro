![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/orcadrone.jpg)The [US Navy has recently ordered](https://dod.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract-View/Article/1757113/) four Orca Extra-Large Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (XLUUVs) from Boeing, in a contract worth $43 million. The Orca XLUUVs are very large diesel-electric drone submarines intended to gather intelligence, place or clear naval mines, attack other ships or submarines, conduct stand-off strikes, and more.

The Orca is a design based on the Boeing Echo Voyager demonstration submarine with a range of 6,500 nautical miles. The vessel measures 51 by 8.5 by 8.5 feet and has a dry weight of 50 tons. The Echo Voyager has a maximum speed of around eight knots underwater and can dive to depths up to 11,000 feet deep. Its batteries give it a range of more than 150 miles at a speed of around 3 knots before it needs to surface and use its air-breathing diesel generator to recharge. Boeing has said that Echo Voyager could carry enough fuel to allow it to operate autonomously for up to six months at a time. It has its own sonar-enabled obstacle avoidance system, as well as an inertial navigation system.
