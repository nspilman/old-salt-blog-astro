![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/usseisenhower.jpg)Due to Covid-19, the Navy’s Captain Mike Desmond has inadvertently set an, as of yet, unofficial [record for continuous-time deployed at sea.](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/08/31/navy-captain-sets-new-unofficial-record-consecutive-days-sea.html) When the pandemic broke out, the [Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Strike_Group_10) canceled port calls in Europe and remained at sea to avoid contact with the coronavirus.

The [USS *Eisenhower*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Dwight_D._Eisenhower) would ultimately remain at sea for 206 days, setting a new record, along with the cruiser [USS *San Jacinto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_San_Jacinto_\(CG-56\)). Captain Desmond served aboard the *Eisenhower* but late in the deployment was transferred to take command of the Ticonderoga class cruiser [USS *Vella Gulf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Vella_Gulf_\(CG-72\)). The *Vella Gulf* docked in its homeport of Norfolk one day after the *Eisenhower*, so Captain Desmond logged 207 days of continuous sea time.

The previous record is believed to be 160 days, a record set in 2002 by the carrier [*Theodore Roosevelt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Theodore_Roosevelt_\(CVN-71\)) at the beginning of the Afghanistan War.
