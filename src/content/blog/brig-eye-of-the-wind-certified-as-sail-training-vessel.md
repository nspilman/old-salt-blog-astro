Eye of the Wind

The brig 132′ [*Eye of the Wind*](http://www.eyeofthewind.net/en/) has had a long and varied career.  Built in 1911, by C Lühring of Brake, Germany, as a topsail schooner named *Friedrich,* she was initially put into the hides trade with South America.  Later she would carry cargo in the Baltic and North seas, and then fish for herring off the coast of Iceland. In 1969, after being converted to a motor ship, she was nearly lost to a fire. Rebuilt in 1973 and renamed *Eye of the Wind*, she went on to be featured in a number of movies, inlcuding The Blue Lagoon, White Squall, Tai-Pan and Nate & Hayes.  She also served as the flagship for Operation Drake – a two year scientific expedition for young people.  Recently, the *Eye of the Wind* has been certified as a Class A Sail Training Vessel.  Thanks to [Tom Russell](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=13370427&authType=name&authToken=etG3&trk=anet_mfeed_profile) on the Linked-in [Traditional Sail Professionals](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=2041742&trk=anet_ug_hm) group for passing along the news.
