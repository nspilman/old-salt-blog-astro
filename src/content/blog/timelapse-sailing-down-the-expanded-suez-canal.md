Maersk Line has posted a 3-minute time lapse of the *M/V Adrian Maersk*, 6,000 TEUs, passing through the newly expanded New Suez Canal. As reported in [Maritime Executive:](http://maritime-executive.com/article/maersk-posts-three-minute-suez-canal-run-video) The New Suez Canal was inaugurated by Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi in a ceremony held at the port city of Ismailiya on August 6.  The $8 billion project took 11 months to complete, included the widening and deepening of 35 kilometers of the existing Canal up to a depth of 24 meters, as well as digging and creating 37 kilometers of the so-called ”second lane,” running parallel to the existing Canal.
