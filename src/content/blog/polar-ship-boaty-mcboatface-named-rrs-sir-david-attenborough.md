![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Nameboat.jpg)It is official. The polar research ship formerly known as *Boaty McBoatface* will be named RRS *Sir David Attenborough*.  Despite an overwhelming number of suggestions that the UK’s new polar research ship be named *Boaty McBoatface*, [the ship will be named after the world-renowned naturalist and broadcaster](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36225652), who will soon be turning 90. Sir David said he was “truly honoured” by the decision.  One of the new research vessel’s remotely operated vehicles (ROV) will however, be named “Boaty.”

As [we posted last March,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/03/name-uks-new-polar-research-ship-rrs-boaty-mcboatface/) the British Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) asked the public for suggestions for a name for the new polar research ship. J[ames Hand, a former BBC presenter turned press officer, suggested Boaty McBoatface.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/21/man-behind-rrs-boaty-mcboatface-disavows-his-name-for-polar-vessel) Through the wonder of the internet, the suggestion caught on and overwhelmingly became the most popular suggestion, receiving over 120,000 suggestions.  Shortly after Mr. Hand’s suggestion took off, the NERC website crashed from the volume of suggestions. Mr. Hand has since disavowed his suggestion.
