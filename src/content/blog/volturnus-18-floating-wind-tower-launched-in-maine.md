Typically, modern offshore wind turbines come in only one size and shape – really big, rising up from the ocean floor.  The [University of Maine](https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2013/05/30/the-launch-of-volturnus-18/), with support from the [Department of Energy](http://energy.gov/articles/maine-project-launches-first-grid-connected-offshore-wind-turbine-us), has just launched a new test design, the first grid-connected floating wind tower. The tower, launched in Brewer, Me., is supported by three hollow concrete tube floats and will be anchored in the Gulf of Maine.  [VolturnUS 1:8,](https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2013/05/30/the-launch-of-volturnus-18/) which sounds like something from a bad science fiction novel, is only 20 kw in capacity but, should it succeed, the design should be scalable up to much larger installations. Using a floating rather than a fixed platform would allow wind turbines to be installed in much deeper water on the West Coast of the US and along the  Maine Coast.
