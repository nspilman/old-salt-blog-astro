Harvey Gamage

The rumors had been dire for some time and now they appear to be confirmed.  [*Marlinspike Magazine*](https://www.facebook.com/marlinspikemagazine/timeline) is reporting that  the [Ocean Classroom Foundation](http://oceanclassroom.org/)‘s three vessels, the schooners [*Spirit of Massachusetts*](http://oceanclassroom.org/spirit), [*Harvey Gamage*](http://oceanclassroom.org/gamage), & [*Westward*](http://oceanclassroom.org/westward) will be auctioned.  As reported by [Marlinspike](https://www.facebook.com/marlinspikemagazine/timeline):

*All three vessels are said to be in rough shape, particularly SPIRIT, which is currently unrigged and out of the water at Portland Yacht Services. GAMAGE was in service this past winter, but is reportedly not cleared to sail until more work has been done. The steel-hulled WESTWARD, formerly operated by SEA, has not sailed in some time.*

*Work is ongoing to clear liens against the vessels, and OCF is said to have been “very cooperative” in making arrangements. When the lien work is complete, there could be an auction as early as next month for one or more of the vessels.*

*The auction house acknowledged the value of conducting surveys on the vessel, but no word on yet on whether that will happen, or when and how those surveys would be available to potential buyers.  Marlinspike will continue to provide updates on the auctions.*
