From the [Tall Ship *Unicorn* info sheet](http://www.sistersundersail.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tall-Ship-Unicorn-Info-Sheet-v21.pdf): Built in 1947 as a fishing trawler, this Dutch-built beauty has a rich history and is strong with a soul all her own. In December of 2003, the schooner completed a bow to stern refit, giving her a beautiful, bright maple interior and a rechristening to her original name, *Unicorn*. In the summer of 2005, Unicorn was granted a Jones Act Waiver to become a United States registered vessel and she proudly flies the American flag off her stern. This same year, co-owner [Dawn Santamaria](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/sisters-under-sail-founder-dawn-santamaria-awarded-leadership-in-women%E2%80%99s-sailing-award/) founded [Sisters Under Sail](http://www.sistersundersail.org/), a not-for-profit on-board leadership program for teenage girls and women. Sisters Under Sail and her all-female professional crew charter *Unicorn* each summer sailing New England, Canadian Maritimes and the Great Lakes.
