[Oracle Team USA](http://oracle-team-usa.americascup.com/) has come screaming back from what appeared to be an impossible deficit, winning the last 7 races.  In total races, they have now won 10 to the Kiwi’s 8.  Only the two race penalty assessed for past improprieties has kept Oracle from winning the competition already.  Now with the tally board at 8-8, the race this afternoon will determine the winner.  Will [Emirates Team New Zealand](http://emirates-team-new-zealand.americascup.com/) win one final race and take home the Cup or will Oracle maintain their momentum and win it all?  The race is scheduled to start this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time.
