USS Peleliu

Two US Navy officers, in command of the *[USS Gunston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Gunston_Hall_\(LSD-44\))* *[Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Gunston_Hall_\(LSD-44\))* [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Gunston_Hall_\(LSD-44\))and *[USS Peleliu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Peleliu_\(LHA-5\)),* were relieved of their commands within days of each other over charges related to  sexual harassment.

Cmdr. Fred R. Wilhelm, the Commanding Officer of the amphibious dock landing ship *[USS Gunston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Gunston_Hall_\(LSD-44\))* Hall after an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment, simple assault, and conduct unbecoming of an officer.  The ship’s former executive officer, Cmdr. Kevin S. Rafferty, and former command master chief, Wayne Owings, received non-judicial punishment for failing to take action after repeated observations of inappropriate conduct. Owings also faced sexual harassment and simple assault charges.  
  
Also relived of duty was Capt. David Schnell, in command of *[USS Peleliu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Peleliu_\(LHA-5\))*, an amphibious assault ship, currently providing relief services to flood ravaged Pakistan.  A Navy spokesman said that  the captain “acted in an unprofessional manner toward several crew members that was inappropriate, improper and unduly familiar,” but would not elaborate further.

These and other recent firings suggest that the Navy is still working through the difficult issues of sexual harassment aboard ship.  To keep this in perspective, however, the Navy has dismissed a total of 12 commanding officers this year, for all offenses, not limited to sexual harassment, out of a total of approximately 1,000 officers currently in command.
