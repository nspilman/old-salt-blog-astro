[Cretan Tools Point To 130,000-Year-Old Sea Travel](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=132621681)

*Archaeologists on the island of Crete have discovered what may be evidence of one of the world’s first sea voyages by human ancestors, the Greek Culture Ministry said Monday.  A ministry statement said experts from Greece and the U.S. have found rough axes and other tools thought to be between 130,000 and 700,000 years old close to shelters on the island’s south coast.*

What made this announcement a touch odd was that a virtually identical announcement was made last February.  See our [previous post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/02/16/on-crete-new-evidence-of-very-ancient-mariners/) from almost a year ago.
