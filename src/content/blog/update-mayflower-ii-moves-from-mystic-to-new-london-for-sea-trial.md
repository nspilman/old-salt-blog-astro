![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/07/mayflowermysticdock.jpg)Today, [*Mayflower II*](https://www.plimoth.org/what-see-do/mayflower), a replica of the ship that carried the Pilgrims to Plymouth, MA, was towed to New London, CT for two weeks of sea trials and final outfitting before returning to its homeport in Plymouth.

In September of last year, [we posted about the launching](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/09/launching-of-the-mayflower-ii-at-mystic-seaport/) of the *Mayflower II* at the [Mystic Seaport Museum](https://www.mysticseaport.org/)‘s [Henry B. duPont Preservation Shipyard](https://www.mysticseaport.org/explore/shipyard-gallery/). The 64-year-old ship underwent a more than three-year $11 million restoration at the seaport shipyard.

The original plan was to begin moving the *Mayflower II* to Plymouth, MA with a departure in late April including several stops at southern New England ports before a May arrival. The plan was scrapped due to the pandemic. The *Mayflower II* is expected to arrive in Plymouth around August 10th.

[Boston.com](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news-2/2020/07/18/its-11m-makeover-complete-the-mayflower-ii-is-sailing-home) notes that the *Mayflower II* has been a major tourist attraction and educational tool since it arrived in Plymouth as a gift from England in 1957.

Stabilization efforts began in 2014, with the ship spending part of the year in Mystic. Continuous restoration work began at the seaport museum in 2016, with shipwrights from the seaport museum and artisans from Plimoth Plantation engaged in the work. The ship’s keel was saved, but nearly 75% of the vessel is reportedly new.
