Simply trying to keep up with what is going on the battle against piracy is not as easy as it might appear.

For example, *[Maersk Texas](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=366920000)*, a US flag cargo ship [came under attack by pirates](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-vessel-pirates-maerskbre84m13z-20120523,0,4477169.story) in the Gulf of Oman on Wednesday around noon local time, or at least that is what Maersk says.  The European Union’s counter-piracy force said it had reviewed the incident and determined there was “[no case of piracy and it’s a false alarm,”](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2012/05/23/bloomberg_articlesM4HD7T6S972801-M4HKD.DTL) according to Timo Lange, a spokesman for the Northwood, England-based EU Navfor.  [Maersk says that the pirates, attacking in multiple skiffs, were driven off by armed guards](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/danish-shipper-says-guards-thwart-pirate-attack-on-us-flagged-cargo-ship-in-gulf-of-oman/2012/05/24/gJQAC4kjmU_story.html) aboard the ship.   The Iranian Navy, however, says that [they drove off the pirates](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g48JOylhCpq1mlnW6R9UNtpfpBCg?docId=CNG.cbc625c8ca7fc0054d5ccc063039974c.451), who fled only after Iranian naval vessels appeared on the scene.

Everyone does agree that no one was hurt aboard the *Maersk Texas* and that she proceeded on her voyage.  We hope that the rest of the voyage proves uneventful. Thanks to Phil Leon for the heads up.
