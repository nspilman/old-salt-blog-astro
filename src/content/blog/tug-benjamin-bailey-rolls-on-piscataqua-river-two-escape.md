On Wednesday afternoon, [the tug *Benjamin Bailey* rolled and suddenly capsized](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2012/10/24/three-people-escape-as-tugboat-sinks-in-portsmouth-nh-river/) in the currents of the Piscataqua River. Fortunately the two crew men aboard managed to escape from the sudden capsize. The tug is owned by Ken Anderson of Riverside & Pickering Marine Contractors, based in Eliot, Maine and was working on the construction of the new Memorial Bridge connecting Portsmouth, N.H., to Kittery, Maine. There will be an attempt to [raise the tug from the river on Friday](http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20121025-NEWS-121029830). This is the second tugboat to sink this year in this section of the river. Both boats were working on the Memorial Bridge project.
