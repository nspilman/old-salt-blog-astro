![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/banner1.jpg)Sailing and sipping single malt scotch are among two of my favorite activities, (though not necessarily at the same time.)   It does seem fitting that [Old Pulteney Single Malt Scotch Whisky](http://www.oldpulteney.com/home.php) and [US Sailing](http://home.ussailing.org/) have partnered to introduce the inaugural [Old Pulteney Maritime Heroes Award.](http://www.maritimeheroes.com/)  From their press release:

[Old Pulteney Single Malt Scotch Whisky and US Sailing Introduce the Maritime Heroes Award: Calling Nominations for an Unsung Hero in the Sailing Community](http://www.prweb.com/releases/prweb2012/5/prweb9483517.htm)  
  
*The two brands have partnered to express appreciation to the men and women in sailing communities across the country for their humanitarian achievements. Friends and families are encouraged to nominate an unsung hero to give them the opportunity to receive the recognition they deserve, whether for charitable giving, community advocacy, sailing education or the countless other generous acts.*

*“As Old Pulteney is the Genuine Maritime Malt, we feel it is important to celebrate those individuals who significantly contribute to the vibrancy of the maritime lifestyle,” says Pat Graney, President of International Beverage USA. “Our partnership as the Official Scotch of US Sailing has been invaluable in allowing us to share Old Pulteney’s rich heritage and fine expressions with dedicated sailors across the country.”*

*Nominations for the Old Pulteney Maritime Heroes Award will be accepted through August 31, 2012 at http://www.maritimeheroes.com. Finalists will be selected by Old Pulteney and US Sailing representatives. A public vote will then be held on the website, and the 2012 Maritime Hero will be announced and honored at a gala event in January at US Sailing’s 2013 National Sailing Programs Symposium in Clearwater, Fla.*
