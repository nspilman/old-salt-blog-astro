![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/usstheodoreroosevelt.jpg)The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier [USS *Theodore Roosevelt* (CVN-71)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Theodore_Roosevelt_\(CVN-71\)) has diverted to Guam following an outbreak of coronavirus onboard. Following initial news of three infected sailors, the number of cases is now said to have risen to “[dozens.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/coronavirus-outbreak-diverts-navy-aircraft-carrier-guam-all-5-000-n1169726)”  The sailors infected with the virus have been airlifted to a naval medical hospital on Guam. The infected sailors are reported to have mild cases of the virus and have not required hospitalization. 

The carrier’s medical personnel have begun testing the rest of the crew. There are about 800 test kits onboard the ship. The testing will continue in Guam with the intention of testing all 5,000 aboard. The *Roosevelt* is the first Navy ship at sea to have reported a coronavirus outbreak. 

[In a statement](http://news.usni.org/2020/03/26/coronavirus-outbreak-sidelines-aircraft-carrier-uss-theodore-roosevelt), Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday said, “The resources at our naval medical facilities in Guam will allow us to more effectively test, isolate, and if necessary treat sailors. We expect additional positive tests, and those sailors who test positive will be transported to the U.S. Naval Hospital Guam for further evaluation and treatment as necessary. During the port visit, base access will be limited to the pier for *Roosevelt*‘s Sailors. No base or regional personnel will access the pier.”
