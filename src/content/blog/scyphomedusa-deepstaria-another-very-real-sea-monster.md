There are indeed creatures in the oceans which could be called “sea monsters.”   At the end of last month we posted about [two very real “sea serpents”](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/10/if-oarfish-predict-earthquakes-they-are-doing-a-really-lousy-job/) – oar fish that washed up on the coast of Southern California. Here is an account of another very real, if rarely seen, “sea monster,” the [scyphomedusa Deepstaria](http://youtu.be/EwCgcwuFsBk).  Recently a video from April 2012 has washed up onto the surface of cyberspace with the headline, “[Massive Unidentified Sea Monster caught on Oil-Rig Cam](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=193_1379475235).”

It is a fascinating video showing an undulating creature that almost looks like free-flowing fabric.  The video itself is approaching two years old, so in internet time, it is is not particularity new, even if recent posts have given it a second life. The video was taken by an ROV inspecting a drill rig off Britain.  The creature on the video is also not “unidentified.” It is apparently a jellyfish, a [scyphomedusa Deepstaria](http://youtu.be/EwCgcwuFsBk),  Whether or not it is a “sea monster” is up to the viewer to decide.

The [Deepstaria genus of jellyfish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepstaria) was first encountered on October 22, 1966 during Dive 159 of the research submersible *[Deepstar 4000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Star_4000)*.   Dr Eric G. Barham, Dr George Pickwell, and Mr Ronald Church collected the scyphomedusan at a depth of about 723 m in the San Diego Trough.  The new jellyfish genus was named in honor of the submersible.

Two species have been identified within the Deepstaria genus – the [Deepstaria enigmatica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepstaria_enigmatica) and the [Deepstaria reticulum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepstaria_reticulum), first sighted in 1988.  There appears to be some disagreement as to which of the two species the jellyfish in the video may indeed be.  The [jellyfish has been widely reported to be a Deepstar enigmatica](http://tampa.cbslocal.com/2012/05/10/what-is-that-underwater-drilling-camera-catches-giant-sea-creature/) although [NPR reports](http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2012/05/22/153278791/why-is-that-undulating-blob-of-flesh-inspecting-my-oil-drill) that “*marine biologists from all over rushed in with their own guesses, and the consensus was; yes, it’s a jellyfish, but not an enigmatica. What we have here is a very similar jelly called Deepstaria reticulum…*”  Whether enigmatica or reticulum, here is a wonderful video on the *[Deepstaria genus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepstaria),* produced by the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute](http://www.mbari.org/) and narrated by marine biologist Steve Haddock.
