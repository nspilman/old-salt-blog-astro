Virginia Class submarine

The US Navy christened one of its newest Virginia-class attack submarines, the [USS *Hyman G. Rickover*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Hyman_G._Rickover_\(SSN-795\)) (SSN 795), during a 9 a.m. EDT ceremony Saturday, July 31, 2021, at General Dynamics/Electric Boat, in Groton, Connecticut.

From the [Navy press release](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2714187/navy-to-christen-submarine-rickover/):

*The future USS Hyman G. Rickover (SSN 795) is the second nuclear-powered fast attack submarine in recognition of Adm. Rickover. The first Hyman G. Rickover (SSN 709) was commissioned at Submarine Base, New London, in Groton, on July 21, 1984. SSN 709 and its crew deployed 12 times until its decommissioning in December 2007. Over the years, its decorations included the Atlantic Fleet Golden Anchor Award, Submarine Squadron Eight’s anti-submarine warfare white “A” and engineering red “E” awards and the prestigious Sixth Fleet “Hook ‘Em” award for anti-submarine warfare excellence.*

*Rickover, known as the “Father of the Nuclear Navy,” served in the Navy for 63 years on active duty. His views touched matters of design, propulsion, education, personnel and professional standards. His team of engineers designed and constructed the first nuclear-powered submarine, USS Nautilus (SSN 571). This accomplishment led to the world’s preeminent fleet of nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers.*

*Virginia-class submarines are built to operate in the world’s littoral and deep waters while conducting anti-submarine warfare; anti-surface ship warfare; strike warfare; special operations forces support; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; irregular warfare; and mine warfare missions. Their inherent stealth, endurance, mobility, and firepower directly enable them to support five of the six maritime strategy core capabilities – sea control, power projection, forward presence, maritime security and deterrence. They are replacing Los Angeles-class submarines as they retire.*

The first USS *Hyman G. Rickover* (SSN-709) was a Los Angeles-class submarine, and the only submarine of its class not to be named after a United States city or town. This submarine will be the second of its class not to be named after a U.S. state; the first was the USS *John Warner* (SSN-785).
