![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/12/prinzeugin.jpg)Recently, teams of [Navy specialists have successfully removed](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/us-army-new-uniforms.html) 230,000 gallons of fuel, or close to 800 tons, still aboard the [*Prinz Eugen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_cruiser_Prinz_Eugen) when it sank at Kwajalein, 72 years ago.

The bottom of the lagoon at the [Kwajalein Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwajalein_Atoll) is littered with dozens of sunken ships. Most are from the [Battle of Kwajalein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kwajalein) in 1944, during World War II. One ship, the German heavy cruiser *Prinz Eugen*, was a survivor of not one, but two nuclear weapons tests conducted by the United States at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in 1946. 

*Prinz Eugen,* a German war prize from World War II, was part of [Operation Crossroads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads), a pair of nuclear weapon tests conducted by the United States at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946 to investigate the effect of nuclear weapons on warships. The German cruiser was part of a fleet of 95 target ships assembled in Bikini Lagoon. The ships were fully fueled and provisioned.  The lagoon was hit with two detonations of Fat Man plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapons similar to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, each with a yield of 23 kilotons of TNT. 

*Prinz Eugen* was anchored around 1,200 yards from the epicenter of both blasts and suffered minor damage from each. The second blast caused a minor leak which could not be repaired because the ship was contaminated by radioactive fallout. The radioactive ship was towed to Kwajalein where it sank five months later.

By the mid-70s, there was increasing concern that the fuel aboard the cruiser might leak and contaminate the waters of the atoll.  In February 2018, the US Navy including the Navy’s Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit One, US Army, and the Federated States of Micronesia conducted a joint oil removal effort with the salvage ship USNS *Salvor*, which had cut holes into the ship’s fuel tanks to pump the oil from the wreck directly into the oil tanker *Humber*.  They removed almost 230,000 gallons of oil that had remained on the ship in 173 tanks. By October 15, 2018, the Navy announced that the work had been completed having removed 97% of all the fuel aboard the sunken ship.
