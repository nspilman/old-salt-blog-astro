HMS Terror trapped in the ice

In an interesting historical coincidence, just days after the luxury cruise ship, [*Crystal Serenity,* completed a passage](http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2016/09/12/northwest-passage-cruise) through the Canadian Arctic’s Northwest Passage,  [HMS *Terror*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Terror_\(1813\)) has been found.  HMS *Terror* is the second of two ships from Sir John Franklin’s ill-fated expedition to traverse the Northwest Passage. The ship sank after being abandoned in the Arctic ice 168 years ago. The wreck of HMS *Terror* was found on September 3, appropriately enough, in [Terror Bay](http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-811195&fid=899&c=canada), which is located on the southwest shore of King William Island, in Nunavut. The wreck lies lies 60 miles (96km) south of where experts have long believed the ship was crushed by ice.

The discovery was tied to to local knowledge. [The Week](http://theweek.com/speedreads/648320/mysterious-inuit-tale-leads-researchers-168yearold-wreck-hms-terror) reports: *An Inuk crewman on the team’s research ship, Sammy Kogvik, 49, was talking with the Arctic Research Foundation’s operations director, Adrian Schimnowski, when he recalled a hunting trip in Terror Bay, where he posed for a picture with a large piece of wood sticking out of the sea ice, which resembled a mast. When Kogvik got home and discovered his camera gone, he decided not to speak of the experience, believing the missing camera was an omen of the bad spirits that wander the island.* *But by following Kogvik’s tip, the researchers focused on the north end of Victoria Strait, eventually making their fateful discovery.*

The wreck of HMS *Terror* is said to be in pristine condition. As reported by the Guardian: *On Sunday, a team from the charitable Arctic Research Foundation manoeuvred a small, remotely operated vehicle through an open hatch and into the ship to capture stunning images that give insight into life aboard the vessel close to 170 years ago.*

In 1845, [Captain Sir John Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Franklin) departed England bound for the Northwest Passage aboard HMS *Erebus* and HMS *Terror,* and never returned.  All 129 officers and men were lost.  Searches for the lost expedition continued throughout the 19th century and intermittently, well into the 21th. The wreck of Franklin’s other ship, [HMS *Erebus* was located in 2014.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=HMS+Erebus)

Both HMS *Terror* and HMS *Erebus* were built as “[bomb ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_vessel)” which carried heavy mortars. Because bomb ships were very heavily built, they were often refitted for exploration, particularity in ice.  HMS *Terror*, built in 1813, participated in the unsuccessful British assaults on [Stonington, CT](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/08/repost-battle-stonington-ct-1814-rockets-red-glare-bombs-bursting-air/) and [Fort McHenry in Baltimore, MD](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/12/the-star-spangled-banner-and-the-search-for-hms-terror/) during the War of 1812.  The ship also served as an exploration ship in two Arctic expeditions prior to the doomed Franklin expedition.
