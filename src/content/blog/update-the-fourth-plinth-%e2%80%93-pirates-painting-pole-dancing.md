![pirateontheplinth](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2009/10/pirateontheplinth.jpg)In July we posted about the exhibition of [Yinka Shonibare’s Nelson’s Ship in a Bottle](http://www.london.gov.uk/fourthplinth/plinth/shonibare.jsp) on the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square.  There was an interesting symmetry in the display of Nelson’s ship, *Victory*, in a bottle, on a plinth, in a square named for Nelson’s greatest and last victory onboard *HMS Victory*.

At the time I didn’t fully appreciate what an interesting performance space the Fourth Plinth has become.  Recently, among many other performers and performances,  there has been a man dressed as a [17th century pirate telling bad pirate puns](http://www.skyarts.co.uk/site/plinth/?id=45) ( in the video the pirate punster is preceded and followed by singers)  as well as [a topless plinth pole dancer](http://www.skyarts.co.uk/site/plinth/?id=49) and a [topless body painter](http://www.skyarts.co.uk/site/plinth/?id=9).  Nothing terribly nautical about the last two, except that sailors have always been supporters of the arts, particularly when undressed women are involved.
