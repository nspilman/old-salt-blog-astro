[![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/archealogycourse.jpg)](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shipwrecks)For anyone with an interest in shipwrecks, here is a very interesting [free online course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shipwrecks) that marine archaeologist [John Broadwater](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/12/40925/) pointed out on Facebook.  It has just started but there is still time to sign up. 

**ABOUT THE COURSE**  
*People have explored and depended on the oceans of our planet for millennia. During that time the geography of our world has changed radically as coastal regions have flooded and islands have risen up, or been lost beneath the waves. With 70% of the world’s surface covered by water, an unparalleled, yet largely untouched record of human life has been left beneath the sea for us to discover, from our earliest ancestors right through to present day. Over the length of this Shipwrecks and Submerged Worlds course we will learn about maritime archaeology together – exploring underwater landscapes from the ancient Mediterranean to the prehistoric North Sea, and consider Shipwrecks from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific coast of the Americas.*
