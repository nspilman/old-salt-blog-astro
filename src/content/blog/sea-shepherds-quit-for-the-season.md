![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/01/sea-shepherd.jpg)After having their toy racing boat, *Ady Gil* [sunk in a collision](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/01/09/the-sinking-of-the-ady-gil-and-how-it-may-haunt-the-sea-shepherds/) with a whaling ship; after experiencing engine problems as well as having the registration of their converted whaler, the *[B0b Barker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barker_\(ship\))*, pulled by the Togolese; after having the captain of the *Ady Gil* arrested when he boarded a Japanese whaler; and then after using the *[Steve Irwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barker_\(ship\))* [to pelt the Japanese ships with crocodile bath toys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barker_\(ship\)), the Sea Shepherds have ended their season of harassment and are sailing for home.

For the record, we also oppose Japanese whaling, but we do not support the vigilante violence of the Paul Watson and his bumbling seagoing circus.  Thanks to Captain D. Peter Boucher of the [Nautical Log](http://nauticallog.blogspot.com/) for the heads up
