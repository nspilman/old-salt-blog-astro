Not quite three weeks ago the [50′ steel pinky schooner](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/04/08/the-sands-of-fire-island-le-papillon-and-gluckauf/) *[Le Papillon](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/04/08/the-sands-of-fire-island-le-papillon-and-gluckauf/)* came ashore on Fire Island, a barrier island off Long Island, northeast of the entrance to New York harbor.  [Will van Dorp at the Tugster blog](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/ashore-4/) has taken some amazing photographs of the schooner, first being battered by waves and now being swallowed up by the sand, like a scene from a slow motion horror movie.  ([Go to Will’s blog for more and larger photographs.](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/ashore-4/))  *Le Papillon* may yet be salvaged but it will be a race against time and the shifting sands of Fire Island.

As [we posted earlier in the month](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/04/08/the-sands-of-fire-island-le-papillon-and-gluckauf/), the 300 foot long tanker *[Gluckauf](http://www.aukevisser.nl/german/id95.htm)* ran aground on Fire Island in 1893 about  twenty miles up the beach from where *Le Papillon* now lies*.* The **Gluckauf** was never salvaged and was also swallowed by the shifting sand.
