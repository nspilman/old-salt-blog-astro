Just over a week ago, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management [granted conditional approval for Shell](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/05/11/one-step-closer-to-arctic-drilling-obama-administration-grants-shell-conditional-approval/) to begin exploratory drilling in the Chukchi Sea in the Alaskan Arctic. Last Thursday, the *[Polar Pioneer](http://www.rigzone.com/data/offshore_drilling_rigs/1095/Semisub/Transocean_Ltd/Transocean_Polar_Pioneer)*, a semi-submersible drilling rig, owned by Transocean, but operated by Shell, arrived in Seattle. This weekend protesters, calling themselves “[Shell-No kayak-tavists](https://shellno.org/who-we-are.php),” joined in the “[Paddle in Seattle](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32770382)” in a fleet of hundreds of kayaks, canoes, paddle boards and other small vessels, swarmed near the massive drilling rig, to send a message to Shell opposing their continued attempts at Arctic drilling.  One of the primary concerns about Arctic drilling is that the [harsh conditions make oil spills likely and extremely difficult to clean up.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/04/140423-national-research-council-on-oil-spills-in-arctic/) The damage to the Arctic environment could be severe.

In 2012, Shell attempted to drill exploratory wells in the Chukchi Sea and failed badly.  The attempt was a litany of broken equipment, poor planning, and inadequate engineering.  [The Shell drilling ship, *Noble Discoverer* was cited by the Coast Guard](http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/coast-guard-inspection-turns-safety-issues-ill-fated-noble-discoverer) for significant failures with pollution control equipment and crew safety.  The other [Shell vessel, the drill rig](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/01/shells-alaska-drilling-rigs-towlines-taxes-and-engine-failures/) *[Kulluk](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/01/shells-alaska-drilling-rigs-towlines-taxes-and-engine-failures/),* broke her towline in bad weather and ran aground on Kodiak Island. Fortunately, it was removed without an oil spill.

The [Interior Department’s review of Shell’s 2012 efforts](http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/upload/Shell-report-3-8-13-Final.pdf) concluded:  “*Shell entered the drilling season not fully prepared in terms of fabricating and testing certain critical systems and establishing the scope of its operational plans. The lack of adequate preparation put pressure on Shell’s overall operations and timelines at the end of the drilling season.*” They go on to enumerate “.*..serious deficiencies in Shell’s management of contractors, as well as its oversight and execution of operations in the extreme and unpredictable conditions offshore of Alaska.*”

Shell promises to do a better job this time. Nevertheless, the *Polar Pioneer*, is owned by [Transocean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transocean). If that name sounds familiar it is because Transocean also owned the *[Deepwater Horizon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon)*, the oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico that blew up in April 2010, killing eleven and spilling, according to government estimates, 4.9 million barrels of oil. Yes, that is right, one of the rigs to be used in drilling in the Alaskan Arctic is being provided by the people who, along with BP and Halliburtan,  brought us the worst offshore oil ship in history, the [Deepwater Horizon spill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill).
