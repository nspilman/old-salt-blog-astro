![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/03/petrel.jpg)Yesterday, the research vessel *[Petrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Petrel)* rolled off her blocks in a drydock in Edinburgh, Scotland, leaving 35 people injured. [BBC reports](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-scotland-65041272?zephr-modal-register) that twenty-three people were taken to the hospital and 12 were treated at the scene of the incident at Imperial Dock in Leith. The 3,371 GT research toppled over in strong winds rolling to an angle of 45 degrees.

The *Petrel* was previously owned by [Paul Allen](https://www.paulallen.com/), one of the founders of Microsoft. With Allen’s support, the vessel achieved an awe-inspiring record of underwater discoveries, locating a veritable fleet of lost naval shipwrecks.

Allen bought *Petrel* in 2016 to become a dedicated research and exploration platform. After a 2016–2017 retrofit, Petrel was equipped with state-of-the-art technology and the latest systems integration to allow deep-sea search. The vessel had a 6,000 m (19,685 ft) depth-capable ROV, an AUV, and a multibeam echo sounder. It also has dynamic positioning capability that allowed the vessel to stay in station for ROV operations.

In 2017, *Petrel* discovered the Italian World War II destroyer *Artigliere*; the heavy cruiser USS *Indianapolis*; and the wrecks of the Japanese battleships *Yamashiro*, *Fusō*, and the destroyers *Michishio*, Yamagumo, and *Asagumo*. It also located the wrecks of the American destroyers USS *Ward*, USS *Cooper*, the Japanese destroyer *Shimakaze*, and what is believed to be two Yūgumo-class destroyers.

In 2018, *Petrel* located the wreck of the aircraft carrier USS *Lexington*, which sank during the Battle of the Coral Sea as well as the antiaircraft light cruiser USS *Juneau* which sank with the loss of 687 men, which included the five Sullivan brothers. It also discovered the wreck of the light cruiser USS *Helena*.

Despite Paul Allen’s death in late 2018, *Petrel* continued her string of discoveries in 2019. These included the American aircraft carriers USS *Wasp,* USS *Hornet*, and USS *St. Lo;* the Japanese carriers *Kaga*, and *Akagi*; the Japanese cruisers *Furutaka, Maya, Mogami,* and *Chōkai;* the Japanese battleship *Hiei*; and the American destroyers USS *Strong*, and USS *Johnston*. The *Johnstone* is believed to be the deepest shipwreck ever located at 20,406 feet (6,220 m) deep.

Also in 2019, the *Petrel* located and surveyed the wrecks of the Philippine ferry, MV *Doña Paz*, and the oil tanker MT *Vector*. The collision of the ferry and the tanker resulted in the deaths of an estimated 4,385 people with only 26 survivors, making it the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster in history.

In 2020, *Petrel* engaged primarily in oceanographic surveying and mapping.

In October 2022, *Petrel* was purchased by the United States Navy for its Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC EXWC), to be operated by the American company Oceaneering International.
