Peking before downrigging

I heard this morning that the heavy lift ship [*Combi Dock III*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/305351000) has entered New York harbor.  (Thanks Daniel Pine for the heads-up.) The ship is reported to be the heavy-lift chartered to carry the windjammer *Peking* back to her home port of Hamburg for restoration.

The German newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt  recently reported: *According to the current timetable, the dock ship “Combi-Dock III” will arrive in New York on July 12, so the trip could start on July 17th.* 

*In the next three days they will be working on the Caddell shipyard in front of Staten Island. The anchor and two approximately 20-meter-long original yards have to be tied to the deck for the crossing and the lines to which the “Peking” is towed from the port.*

The article goes on to say that the arrival and refloating of the ship in Hamburg is expected to be around July 31st.
