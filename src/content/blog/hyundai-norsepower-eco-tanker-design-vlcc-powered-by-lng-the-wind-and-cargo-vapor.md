![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/06/hhiecotanker.jpg)[Hyundai Heavy Industries](https://english.hhi.co.kr/), in a collaboration with [Lloyd’s Register](https://www.lr.org/en-us/) and [Norsepower](https://www.norsepower.com/), has developed the design of an “Eco-Tanker,” a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) with a unique propulsion system combining wind power with natural gas. The design also includes a volatile organic compound (VOC) recovery system which mixes the VOC with the natural gas as fuel. VOC is naturally-occurring vapor from the cargo tank during operation. Wind-assist propulsion is provided by four Norsepower modern Flettner rotors.

Lloyd’s presented Hyundai with [approval in principle (AiP)](https://www.lr.org/en/latest-news/hhi-approval-vlcc-eco-tanker/) for the innovative design at the recent Nor-Shipping 2019 in Oslo, Norway.

Nick Brown, LR’s Marine & Offshore Director, presenting the AiP certificate, commented: “Lloyd’s Register is proud to award this AIP to HHI, with collaboration from Norsepower. LR has a unique expertise in the LNG field and alternative fuels, which is widely recognized by the market. This LNG-fuelled VLCC is a clear step towards meeting the IMO’s 2050 GHG goal.”
