![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/maersk-3.jpg)As an update to our [previous post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/09/hot-times-on-the-charlotte-maersk/), the fire on the *[Charlotte Maersk](http://www.maerskline.com/link/?page=brochure&path=/our_services/vessels)*, which started July 7th, was finally extinguished last Sunday after 11 days of firefighting.

[Charlotte Maersk blaze is extinguished after 11 days](http://www.ifw-net.com/freightpubs/ifw/index/charlotte-maersk-blaze-is-extinguished-after-11-days/20017794184.htm;jsessionid=99F6A56F5911412E187A95858905513D.5d25bd3d240cca6cbbee6afc8c3b5655190f397f)  
  
*The fire involving 150 containers on board the Charlotte Maersk has finally been extinguished, 11 days after the boxes caught alight.*

*Maersk Line said the blaze, which started on 7 July at around 9pm local time, close to Port Klang, Malaysia, was finally extinguished on Sunday.*

*The 8,200teu vessel is now berthed at Tanjung Palepas, Malaysia, and containers are being unloaded.*

*At the height of the blaze, 150 containers were burning at temperatures approaching 1,000 degrees Celcius, which had made it almost impossible for firefighters to get close enough to put the fire out.*

*There are no reported injuries to the 21 crew members. Unconfirmed reports suggest the fire started when a container exploded.*
