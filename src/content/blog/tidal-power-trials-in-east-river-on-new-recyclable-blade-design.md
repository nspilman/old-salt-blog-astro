![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/verdanttri.jpg)One of the concerns with wind and tidal energy installations is that the turbine blades are built from [materials that are not easily recyclable](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-02-05/wind-turbine-blades-can-t-be-recycled-so-they-re-piling-up-in-landfills). As the blades wear out with use, they could create a significant disposal problem. For the last several years, the [US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has been developing new designs](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/08/13/nrels-thermoplastic-blade-research-dives-deep-with-verdant-powers-tidal-energy-turbines/) for turbine blades that could be more easily recycled and may prove more durable in high-energy environments like tidal streams.  

NREL is now partnering with [Verdant Power, whose tidal turbines are currently deployed in New York City’s East River](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/east-river-water-turbine-energy-licence-awarded-to-verdant-power/), to test the new thermoplastic blade design. Unlike the current epoxy-infused composite thermoset blades, the [thermoplastic blades can be melted down and recycled](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201117192628.htm). The thermoplastic blades may also be better suited for use in tidal currents. The current testing should provide real-world data to determine if the new design is more rugged than the current blades. 

Since 2006, Verdant Power has been working to install tidal turbines on the bottom of New York’s East River off Roosevelt Island. Things have not gone entirely smoothly. The turbine blades on their early designs had a tendency to fail in the strong tidal stream. They were not alone in their problems. [OpenHydro’s tidal rotors in the Bay of Fundy](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-big-setback-for-tidal-power) also had a tendency to come apart.

The latest generation of the Verdant design is a modular TriFrame mount, which holds three tidal turbines. The turbine blades are an epoxy thermoset design. (We recently posted about the 2-megawatt [O2 turbine installed off Scotland](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/08/most-powerful-tidal-turbine-goes-on-line-off-scotland/), described as the most powerful grid-connected tidal turbine in the world, that also uses a similar design of epoxy thermoset blades.)

In the first six months of testing of the new Verdant turbine installation, they successfully generated almost 200 megawatt-hours of energy — a U.S. record for marine energy production. In May, Verdant swapped out one of the epoxy-bladed rotors with a new, NREL-manufactured rotor with thermoplastic blades that are identical to the original epoxy blades except for their material.

In addition to the new rotor, an NREL-built data acquisition system is installed inside the tail cone of the newly installed tidal turbine, allowing researchers to measure the strain and angular position of the thermoplastic blades while in action in the East River.
