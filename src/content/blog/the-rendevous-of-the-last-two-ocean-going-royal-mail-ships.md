RMS Queen Mary II & RMS St Helena

[Last month we posted about a rendezvous of the “Three Queens](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/14/cunard-takes-manhattan-the-three-queens-rendezvous-in-the-harbor/),”  the RMS *[Queen Mary II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Queen_Mary_2)*, the MS *[Queen Elizabeth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Queen_Elizabeth)* and the MS *[Queen Victoria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Queen_Victoria)* in New York harbor.   Of the three ships only the *Queen Mary II* has the distinction of the designation RMS for [Royal Mail Ship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail_Ship).   Indeed, there are only two remaining ocean-going ships in the world with the designation RMS,  the RMS *Queen Mary II* and the [RMS *St Helena*](http://rms-st-helena.com/), which carries the mail, as well as passengers, goods and supplies to the island of St Helena and other British outposts in the South Atlantic.  John Edwards on his [Oceanliners.org  blog](http://oceanlinersblog.org/?p=1933) has a great photo of the last two ocean-going Royal Mail Ships off Tristan de Cunah.

There is one other Royal Mail Ship, though not an ocean-going vessel,  in service in the Canadian Muskoka Lakes, the RMS *[Segwun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Segwun)*, the oldest operating steam driven vessel in North America, built in 1887.
