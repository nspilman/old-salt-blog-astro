![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/07/seaventure.jpg)The [*Sea Venture*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Venture) was the flagship of the [Third Supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Supply "Third Supply") mission to the [Jamestown Colony](https://www.history.com/topics/colonial-america/jamestown) that was wrecked in Bermuda in 1609. A 300-ton ship commissioned by the [London Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Company "London Company"), she was one of the first single timbered merchantmen built in England, and also the first dedicated emigration ship. *Sea Venture*‘s wreck is widely thought to have been the inspiration for [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare")‘s play [*The Tempest*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest_\(play\) "The Tempest (play)").

The wreck of the *Sea Venture* on the uninhabited islands of Bermuda also led directly to Bermuda’s colonization. Now, Bermuda is celebrating the landing.

[Bernews](https://bernews.com/2021/07/sea-venture-landing-day-july-28/) reports that a *Sea Venture* Landing Day event — to mark the anniversary of the arrival of the survivors of the Sea Venture shipwreck in Bermuda — will be held on Wednesday, July 28th in the east end.

A spokesperson said, “The St. George’s/Lyme Regis Twinning Association will hold a *Sea Venture* Landing Day to mark the anniversary of the July 28, 1609, arrival of the survivors of the Sea Venture shipwreck in Bermuda.

“*Sea Venture* Landing Day takes place on Wednesday, July 28th from 6 to 7 pm at the northeast end of Gates’ Bay, next to Fort St. Catherine and the St. Regis Bermuda Resort.

“The historical re-enactment begins with a gig representing the *Sea Venture* long boat coming ashore, followed by a re-enactment of the survivors’ arrival.

The survivors of the *Sea Venture* wreck spent nine months on Bermuda and built two pinnaces from local lumber and what they could salvage from the shipwreck. They subsequently sailed on to Jamestown, Virginia.
