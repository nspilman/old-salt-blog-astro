![cruiseshipreturns](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cruiseshipreturns.jpg)Has Royal Caribbean Lines learned its lesson? Just days after a [passenger filed a lawsuit against RCL](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/24/us/royal-caribbean-anthem-of-the-seas-lawsuit/) for knowingly sending the cruise ship [*Anthem of the Seas* into a winter storm off Hatteras](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=anthem+of+the+seas) in early February, the cruise line cut short cut short the latest cruise on *Anthem of the Seas* to avoid a storm brewing off Cape Hatteras on the US East Coast.  RCL tweeted yesterday:

> [#AnthemoftheSeas](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnthemoftheSeas?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) will head back to Cape Liberty immediately to avoid a severe storm & provide guests with a comfortable journey back home.

Later on Saturday evening, they tweeted again:

> We've been closely watching a large storm off the coast of Cape Hatteras. We want to be extra cautious when it comes to weather in the area.

In a previous post, we asked, “[Why did *Anthem of the Seas* sail straight into the storm?](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/02/why-did-anthem-of-the-seas-sail-straight-into-the-storm/)”  Perhaps, RCL has learned its lesson.
