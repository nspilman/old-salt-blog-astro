![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/05/clipperbows.jpg)The ten boat fleet of the [Clipper Round the World Race](http://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/) will officially and formally arrive in New York harbor on Sunday, June 3rd to coincide with the [Queen’s Diamond Jubilee](http://www.thediamondjubilee.org/).  As [Sir Robin Knox-Johnston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Knox-Johnston) sails the *Suhaili*, the 32ft yacht on which he became the first person to sail single-handed non-stop around the world in 1969, up the Thames River in the [Diamond Jubilee Pageant](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18032734), the ten racing yachts of the Clipper Round the World Race fleet will sail up New York Harbor to the North Cove.  Their arrival is expected to be covered live by the BBC.  Among his many exploits, Sir Robin Knox Johnston was the founder of the Clipper Round the World Race in 1996 and is the chairman of Clipper Ventures, which organizes and runs the race.

Until then, the Clipper fleet will hang out, unofficially, in [Liberty Landing marina](http://libertylandingmarina.com/) in the Morris Canal Big Basin in Jersey City, immediately across the the Hudson River from North Cove.  The ten boats will have been in the harbor for almost a week prior to their “official” arrival.  
  
The [Clipper Round the World Race](http://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/) is different from all the other major around the world races.  The [Volvo Ocean Race](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/06/volvo-ocean-race-off-to-rough-start-two-of-six-boats-damaged-in-first-24-hours/), for example, is being sailed in high-speed [Open 70s](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/23/volvo-open-70s-too-fast-too-furious/) with bleeding edge technology, manned by professional crews and funded by either principalities or large international corporations.  The Clipper Round the World Race welcomes everyone from bankers to plumbers to housewives.  The boats are 68′ stripped down racing yachts, but of a slightly older and far more rugged design than the Volvo speed sleds.   The current race is the eighth Clipper Round the World Race raced by non-professional sailors.

Of course, putting on the race is still a costly undertaking and while one need not be a millionaire to participate, the full race is still a considerable investment.  The cost for the upcoming 40,000 nautical mile 2013-2014 race will be £43,070 (US$68,335.)   This includes the pre-race training, food and accommodation on board during the race plus a set of ocean racing oilskins and other clothing. The berth fees for a single leg, including 32 days training and the crew clothing pack, will range from £9,358 to £10,418 (US$14,840 to $16,520) for the 2013-2014 race.

Yesterday afternoon, I visited the Clipper fleet in Liberty Landing and met Lisa Blair who is making the complete circumnavigation, sailing on the yacht *Gold Coast Australia*. The sail hasn’t been easy. In February, *Gold Coast Australia* had to divert to Taiwan to evacuate two crew members, one who broke his leg in the race and the other with a head injury from Singapore to Qingdao, China.

Lisa is a young Australian with continuing sailing ambitions.  She is documenting her race around the world on her website and blog, [Lisa Blair Sails the World](http://www.lisablairsailstheworld.com/).
