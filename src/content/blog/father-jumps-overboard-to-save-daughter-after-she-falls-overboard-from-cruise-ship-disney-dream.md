![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/06/disney-dream.jpg)An odd story with a distinctly happy ending. On Sunday, a young girl fell overboard from the [*Disney Dream*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Dream) cruise ship in the Atlantic Ocean.  Her father immediately jumped overboard to rescue his daughter. Both were rescued by the ship’s crew.

“The Crew aboard the *Disney Dream* swiftly rescued two guests from the water,” a Disney Cruise Line spokesperson told [USA TODAY](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2025/06/29/disney-dream-child-overboard/84410205007/) in a statement. “We commend our Crew Members for their exceptional skills and prompt actions, which ensured the safe return of both guests to the ship within minutes. We are committed to the safety and well-being of our guests, and this incident highlights the effectiveness of our safety protocols.”

Social media posts from cruisers described the rapid reaction from crew members, who launched life preservers and deployed a rescue boat within minutes. In a Facebook post, passenger Kevin Furuta said, “A girl fell overboard from the 4th deck & her dad went in after her … Thankfully the DCL rescue team was on it immediately and both were saved!”

The father tread water for about 20 minutes before cruise ship members arrived in a lifeboat, the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14859471/Fathers-heroic-dash-save-daughter-went-overboard-Disney-Dream-cruise-ship.html) reported.

The ship was returning to Fort Lauderdale from a four-day trip to Bermuda when the young girl went overboard. 

The age of the young girl has not been made public.

It is also unclear how she made it over the railing. The [Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010](https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ207/PLAW-111publ207.pdf), requires that all open decks and balconies are required to have railings “not less than 42 inches”. The fall took place from Deck 4, which includes a jogging track and is lined with plexiglass safety barriers.
