In November [we posted that the world’s largest iceberg, dubbed A68a](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/11/worlds-biggest-iceberg-on-collision-course-with-south-georgia/), was drifting on a collision course with the island of South Georgia. The iceberg calved from Antarctica’s Larsen C ice-shelf in 2017. The berg weighed roughly one trillion tons and measured 4,200 sq km, or almost the size of the state of Delaware. The fear is that the iceberg might run aground on the sloping seabed around South Georgia, threatening wildlife, particularly penguins and seals.

It now appears that that the massive iceberg is breaking up.

Andrew Fleming, of the British Antarctic Survey, has been tracking A68a for over three years and told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/giant-iceberg-heading-toward-south-atlantic-island-breaks-n1252204) that two new icebergs, named A68e and A68f, were “calved” away from A68a on Tuesday.

The two new fragments, 253 and 87 square miles each, as well as the original A68a, now more than 1,000 square miles in size — about two-thirds the size of Rhode Island — are still huge, according to Fleming. They are expected to continue drifting close to South Georgia island and the potential for them to ground on the island still exists.

“The fragmentation does not remove the chance of it happening, but it won’t now be as one huge piece,” Fleming said. “But there is still the potential for it to disturb things.”
