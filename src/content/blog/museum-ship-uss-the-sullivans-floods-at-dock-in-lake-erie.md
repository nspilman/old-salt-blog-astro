![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sullivans.jpg)Sad news. The museum ship, the USS [*The Sullivans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_The_Sullivans_\(DD-537\)) in the [Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park](https://buffalonavalpark.org/) was taking on water Thursday morning.  Buffalo News reports that Paul Marzello, park president and CEO, said the park staff realized the ship was taking on water between 9 and 10 p.m. Wednesday. They put an emergency repair call into Bidco, the company hired to repair the hull of the decommissioned destroyer.

USS *The Sullivans* (DD-537) is a retired [United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy") [*Fletcher*\-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher-class_destroyer "Fletcher-class destroyer") [destroyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer "Destroyer"). The ship was named in honor of the five [Sullivan brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_brothers "Sullivan brothers") (George, Francis, Joseph, Madison, and Albert) aged 20 to 27 who lost their lives when their ship, [USS *Juneau*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Juneau_\(CL-52\) "USS Juneau (CL-52)"), was sunk by a Japanese submarine during the [Naval Battle of Guadalcanal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal "Naval Battle of Guadalcanal") on 13 November 1942. This was the greatest military loss by any one American family during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). She was also the first ship commissioned in the Navy that honored more than one person.
