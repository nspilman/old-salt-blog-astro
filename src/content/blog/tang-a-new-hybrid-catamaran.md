When I had a sailboat, I hated motoring.   The diesel was loud and vibrated, completely different from why I went out sailing in the first place. [Tag Yachts](http://www.tagyachts.com/) in South Africa, in partnership with [Electric Marine Propulsion](http://www.electricmarinepropulsion.org/Index.html) and [International Battery](http://newsblaze.com/story/2010092805142800004.bw/topstory.html), may have solved the problem in their new 60-foot catamaran named *Tang*.  When not under sail, the boat is powered by electric motors.  When sailing the propellers are turned by the boat’s wake and recharge the batteries.  There are also twin diesel generators to recharge the batteries when not under sail or on shore power.  The catamaran is built of carbon fiber.  The owner plans on sailing the boat to Florida and to make an appearance at the Miami Boat show in February.
