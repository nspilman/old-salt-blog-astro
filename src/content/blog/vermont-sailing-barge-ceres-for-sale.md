![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/08/ceres2.jpg)Around six years ago, Vermont farmer Eric Andrus had an idea. Why not build a [sailing barge to carry non-perishable produce down Lake Champlain to the Hudson](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/10/vermont-sail-freight-projects-cere-setting-sail/) and onward to markets along the river and on to New York City?  They raised money and built the sailing barge *Ceres.* On the 330 mile journey downriver, the barge carried produce from 30 different farms and made stops at historic river towns along the way, selling goods at “pop-up” markets along the riverside. 

As a demonstration project, the sailing barge was a success. Economically, however, it didn’t pay. Logistics and facilities on the river and especially in New York harbor were challenging and costs were higher than anticipated. So, the 39’6″ long sailing cargo barge *Ceres* was moved into a barn for storage. 

And now, apparently, the time has come for *Ceres* to find a new owner and a new occupation.  On his [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/erik.andrus.7/posts/10157571579848330), Eric posted: 

*After 4 years, this sailing cargo vessel is wearing out her welcome in my barn. So here’s another effort to re-home her. Any takers out there? If not as a boat, maybe as a terrestrial tiny house conversion or perhaps a viking funeral prospect?*

The sailing cargo barge is listed for sale on [Craigslist](https://vermont.craigslist.org/boa/d/ferrisburg-sailing-barge/6951793169.html).  The barge is 39’6” long with a 10’ beam, with a traditional Thames sailing barge spritsail ketch rig on tabernacles.  [Click here to learn more.](https://vermont.craigslist.org/boa/d/ferrisburg-sailing-barge/6951793169.html)
