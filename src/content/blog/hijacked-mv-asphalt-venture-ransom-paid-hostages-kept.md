![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pirates2.jpg)The *MV Asphalt Venture* was hijacked by Somali pirates on September 28, 2010.  After negotiating and being paid a multi-million dollar ransom, the pirates released the ship and part of the crew yesterday,  but continued to hold seven Indian seafarers hostage, reportedly in retaliation for the arrest of Somali pirates by the Indian Navy in recent weeks.  ‘It is a major shift in the pirate-hostage equation which will need to be considered and addressed by the international community,’  said general secretary Abdulgani Y. Serang of the National Union of Seafarers of India (NUSI).
