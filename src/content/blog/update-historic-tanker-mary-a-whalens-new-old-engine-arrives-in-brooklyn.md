![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mwengine.jpg)In May of this year, we posted [Scrambling to Save an Engine for the Historic Tanker Mary A. Whalen.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/05/scrambling-to-save-an-engine-for-the-historic-tanker-mary-a-whalen/) The post described how the historic tanker [*Mary A. Whalen*](https://redhookwaterstories.org/items/show/1739) was in dire need of parts to restore its diesel engine. A powerplant in Missouri had a compatible diesel. All that was necessary was to raise the money to move the engine cross-country before the power plant needed to dispose of the engine.

Thanks to the support of generous donors and despite the deadly pandemic, enough was raised to rescue the engine and truck it to Brooklyn. The new/old engine will be key to restoring the *Mary A. Whalen*‘s Fairbanks Morse 37E12, six-cylinder, direct reversing engine. Congratulations to [Portside New York](https://portsidenewyork.org/) and thanks to all those who helped make it happen.
