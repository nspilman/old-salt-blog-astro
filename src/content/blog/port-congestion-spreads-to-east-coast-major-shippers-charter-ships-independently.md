![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cshipsanchor.jpg)We recently posted about [the record congestion in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/09/container-ship-port-backlog-breaking-both-ends-of-the-supply-chain/) where over 60 container ships wait at anchor or simply drift offshore awaiting berth space.  The port congestion has spread to the East Coast where more than [two dozen ships are waiting for dock space off the coast near New York](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10029043/Dozens-ships-coast-New-York-wait-dock-countrys-second-largest-port.html).

The pandemic is largely blamed for the breakdown of the shipping supply chain. Pandemic-related pent-up demand for goods has created a huge trade imbalance with Asia, while labor shortages among longshoremen, truck drivers and other support and logistics staff have slowed cargo moving through the ports and transport hubs. In addition to delays in cargo deliveries, container shipping rates have also skyrocketed.  Market rates for a 40′ container have risen from an average of around $1,500 in June 2020 to a [record price of over $20,000 in August 2021](https://www.reuters.com/business/china-us-container-shipping-rates-sail-past-20000-record-2021-08-05/).

Several major shippers have taken matters into their own hands. In June, [Home Depot](https://theloadstar.com/home-depot-charters-its-own-containership-to-safeguard-against-delays/), the third-largest US importer by volume of ocean containers, announced that it was chartering a containership to meet supply chain delivery shortfalls by the major ship operators.

Last week, the big-box wholesale retailer [Costco announced that it was chartering three container ships](https://www.businessinsider.com/costco-charters-3-container-ships-amid-global-shipping-crisis-2021-9) and leasing thousands of containers to import products from Asia to the US and Canada. Costco is expected to make about 10 deliveries over the next year using these ships, accounting for around 20% of its imports from Asia.

Costco has recently [put limits on the amount of toilet paper, cleaning products, and water](https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/574043-costco-limiting-sales-of-toilet-paper-water) available for purchase by its customers, blaming port delays and a shortage of delivery drivers.
