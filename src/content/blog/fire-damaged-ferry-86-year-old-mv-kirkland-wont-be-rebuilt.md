![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/MV_Kirkland.jpg)[Argosy Cruises](http://www.argosycruises.com/) has announced that the 86 year old ferry, [](http://www.maritimeheritage.net/attractions/attraction_select.asp?id=9)*[MV Kirkland](http://www.maritimeheritage.net/attractions/attraction_select.asp?id=9)*, which was severely damaged by fire at the end of last month, will not be rebuilt.  The 1924 wooden-hulled car ferry served passengers all over the Pacific Northwest. The vessel spent much of her her career on the Columbia River and on Puget Sound and finally served as a tour boat on Lake Washington. She was used by the US Navy to lay mines in World War II. The *Kirkland* is listed on the Washington Historic Register and the National Register of Historic Places.

*The long history of the 86-year-old M/V Kirkland has come to an end.*

*The old wooden boat, currently owned by Argosy Cruises, caught fire on Aug. 28 as it sat moored at the marina. Some 50 firefighters fought the fire and had it out within 30 minutes, but in the weeks since the fire, officials said the damage was just too much and it was declared a total loss.*

*In a press release, Argosy says to their employees and Kirkland residents, it feels like “they had lost a family member, she was woven in as part of the Kirkland community and will be sorely missed.”*
