A few hours ago, [Professor Chris Turney](https://twitter.com/ProfChrisTurney), on the  *[MV Akademik Shokalskiy](http://expeditionsonline.com/vessels/expedition-ships/akademik-shokalskiy/)* currently trapped in pack ice off Antarctica, south of Tasmania, tweeted:  *Great news. Icebreaker Snow Dragon on horizon with penguins! Everyone very happy!*   

We suspect that the penguins are not actually part of the rescue.  Professor Turney also tweeted a [light-hearted Vine video](https://vine.co/v/h9r9IwB1wJM).  Click on the upper left corner of the video for sound.

The *Akademik Shokalskiy* is one of eight Finnish-built [*Akademik Shuleykin-class*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademik_Shuleykin_class_oceanographic_research_vessel) ice-strengthened oceanographic research ships built for the USSR. Five of the class have been converted to expedition cruise ships.
