![](http://oldsaltpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Judas-Island3thumb.jpg)Last June, [we reviewed](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/06/joan-druetts-judas-island-a-review/) Joan Druett’s *[Judas Island](http://www.amazon.com/JUDAS-ISLAND-Promise-Gold-Druett-ebook/dp/B00CSZH062/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1390425948&sr=8-2&keywords=judas+island)*, the first book her Promise of Gold Series. Here is an excerpt from a [recent review](http://www.cindyvallar.com/Druett.html) by Cindy Vallar from her wonderful [Pirates and Privateers](http://www.cindyvallar.com/Druett.html) blog. *Captain Jahaziel “Jake” Dexter believes a pirate’s old sea journal contains the map to the lost treasure of Panama. Back in 1670 the Spaniards feared that Henry Morgan intended to steal their gold, so they loaded it onto a ship with a group of nuns. The ship and all aboard were never heard from again. Nearly two centuries later, Jake and his crew arrive at Judas Island in hopes of retrieving that gold.* *While his men dig on the spooky island, Jake remains aboard his brig, waiting for his mate to return. Charlie has rowed over to a ship to broker a deal for whale oil, which they will sell in Valparaiso, Chile for a tidy profit. What Charlie returns with, however, is a passenger – and a female one to boot.* Read the rest of the review on the [Pirates and Privateers](http://www.cindyvallar.com/Druett.html) blog.
