Earlier in the month, [we posted about a a 66 feet long, 165 tonne, starfish and barnacle encrusted, steel and concrete floating dock](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/07/tsunami-dock-washes-up-on-the-oregon-coast/) that washed up on Agate beach, south-west of Portland, Oregon.  We were surprised to hear that the dock, torn free in last year’s Japanese tsunami  would become a tourist attraction.  The Japanese dock has drawn tens of thousands of visitors tot he beach since it washed ashore in early June.   It won’t stay a tourist attraction for long, however.   Earlier this week, Oregon officials picked Ballard Diving & Salvage of Vancouver, Wash., to dismantle the dock for $84,155. The company says it plans to start Monday and complete the job in about a week.
