The [Pride of Baltimore II](http://www.pride2.org/index.php) needs your help.  The [Pepsi Refresh Project](http://www.refresheverything.com/boatingsafetysavinglives) is giving away $1.3 million dollars toward “ideas that refresh the Gulf.”  The Pride of Baltimore organization is competing for a $50, 000 grant to teach boating safety from the decks of the replica Baltimore clipper.   There are 1140 competitors and only the top ten will win the $50,000 grants.   The *Pride II* is currently ranking at 288. To help move her closer to winning, go to [Teach Boating safety from the decks of Pride II, America’s Tall ship](http://www.refresheverything.com/boatingsafetysavinglives) and vote for the project.  You can vote once a day until the end of September.  To receive a daily email reminder, send an email to [Missy@pride2.org](mailto:Missy@pride2.org) and in the subject line enter Pepsi.
