![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/steamboats.jpg)The Ohio River may just be too high to allow the running of the [Great Steamboat Race on May 4th](http://www.hellolouisville.com/commons/pages/articles/event/2011_great_steamboat_race_hits_the_ohio_may_4/198731/), between the [Belle of Louisville](http://www.belleoflouisville.org/) and the [Belle of Cincinnati](http://www.bbriverboats.com/) on May 4.   If the river doesn’t fall, officials are considering several options including not leaving the dock and simply having a party.

[Ohio River conditions could cloud outlook for Great Steamboat Race](http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20110421/DERBYFUN03/304210062/Ohio-River-conditions-could-cloud-outlook-Great-Steamboat-Race?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Home)  
  
*Heavy spring rains have caused the river to rise, and sent debris, including whole trees, cascading downriver on a swift current.*

*If river conditions render it unsafe for the boats to compete, a land-based competition among the crews might be used to determine the “winner,’ or if the boats can sail but river conditions are iffy, the boats might simply cruise a straight race upriver and eliminate the tricky turnaround and the finish downtown.*

*Another possibility is that the boats stay docked at the downtown wharf while passengers party, Kentucky Derby Festival officials said at a waterfront news conference Thursday morning.*

*Officials said the U.S. Coast Guard in consultation with the two Belles’ captains will have the final say on the race, but safety will be the primary factor. They said the boats probably won’t race, if the river level is 19 feet or higher.*

*Mike Callahan, National Weather Service hydrologist, said that this far in advance it is “almost impossible to make a precise prediction” of the Ohio’s level on May 4. He said the river was at 23.6 feet at mid-day Thursday, about a half-foot above flood stage. But he said up to 4 inches of rain is forecast through Saturday and that the river level was expected to crest around 29 feet on Sunday.*
