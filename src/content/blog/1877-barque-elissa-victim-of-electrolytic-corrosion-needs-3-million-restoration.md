Elissa under sail

The [barque *Elissa*](http://www.galvestonhistory.org/1877_Tall_Ship_Elissa.asp), built in 1877 in Aberdeen, Scotland, the Official Tall ship of the State of Texas and the star attraction at the [Texas Seaport Museum](http://www.galvestonhistory.org/Texas_Seaport_Museum.asp) in Galveston, is suffering from electrolytic corrosion, which if not repaired, may keep the ship tied to its moorings at the dock.  The cost for the restoration is estimated to be roughly $3 million. This weekend, the [Galveston Historical Foundation](http://www.galvestonhistory.org/)  is launching  a “Keep Elissa Sailing” campaign to raise money for the restoration.

What is electrolytic corrosion?  [Electrolytic corrosion](http://books-for-sail.com/mechanical-electrical/43-galvanic-corrosion-or-is-it-electrolytic-corrosion-its-important-to-be-able-to-tell-the-difference.html) is “*caused by an external source of current – often a leakage somewhere. Electrolytic corrosion is very common in marinas, where boats can find themselves linked together by the earth (ground) wire of their AC shore supplies. An electrical leak in one boat can cause untold damage in its neighbours*.”

*Elissa, the three-masted, iron-hulled tall ship, has a $3 million electrolytic corrosion problem with its hull, Dwayne Jones, executive director of the Galveston Historical Foundation, said.* 

*Discovered during a routine dry-dock inspection the U.S. Coast Guard requires be done twice every five years, the problem threatens to keep the ship moored unless the foundation pays for its restoration.*

*On Saturday, during an event called History on Tap, the foundation will launch a Keep Elissa Sailing campaign to raise money for the restoration. This would mark the second restoration since 1982, just shy of its 30th anniversary.*
