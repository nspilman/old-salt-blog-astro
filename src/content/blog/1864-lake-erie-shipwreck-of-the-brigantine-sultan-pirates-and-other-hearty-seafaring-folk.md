Recently, divers from [Cleveland Underwater Explorers, Inc](http://www.clueshipwrecks.org/). discovered the wreck of the brigantine *Sultan*, which sank in September 1864 in Lake Erie in 45 feet of water.  The ship is in quite good shape.

Beyond the discovery itself being interesting, I can’t help but be amused by the reporting.  The brigantine is described by the writer as a “*double-masted, solid wood structure, … a favorite among both pirates and other hearty seafaring folk.*”   If  the ship had been a “solid wood structure,”  the loading of cargo would have been very difficult but it would have been much harder to sink.  Most “seafaring folk” are reasonably “hearty,” I suppose, even if the Great Lakes is not well known for pirates.  [Roaring Dan Seavey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Seavey) is the only Great Lakes pirate that I am familiar with, but he came along after the *Sultan* sank.  Nevertheless, the reporter does deserve points for effort. Thanks to Phil Leon for passing the article along.
