![shark30n-2-web](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/12/shark30n-2-web.jpg)Two recent items on sharks in the news — a photobombing shark off the coast of California and Australian sharks posting warnings on Twitter.

Off Manhattan Beach, California, [June Emerson took a photograph of her son and a friend](http://ktla.com/2013/12/28/photo-captures-apparent-encounter-with-shark-in-manhattan-beach/#axzz2opqjVNOg) playing in the surf but didn’t realize until they were on their way home that there appears to be a large shark behind them and to the right.  She posted the photo on Facebook and Instagram where it quickly went viral –spreading across the internet and being picked up by national newspapers and television news programs.   [Local station KTLA](http://ktla.com/2013/12/28/photo-captures-apparent-encounter-with-shark-in-manhattan-beach/#axzz2opqjVNOg) reports that sightings of great white sharks are not uncommon near Manhattan Beach.

On the other side of the world, Australian sharks are using Twitter to warn swimmers of their presence.   Specifically, [GrindTV](http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/nature/post/sharks-in-australia-are-using-twitter-to-warn-surfers-and-swimmers-of-their-presence/) reports, that “*scientists have fitted 320 sharks, many of them great whites, with transmitters that automatically issue warnings to the [Surf Life Saving Western Australia’s Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/SLSWA) when the tagged sharks approach within a kilometer of the coast’s popular beaches.* 

*For example, a tweet sent early Saturday in Australia reads: ‘Fisheries advise: tagged Bronze whaler shark detected at Garden Island (north end) receiver at 06:0700 AM on 27-Dec-2013.'”*
