![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/washferry.jpg)Talk about unintended consequences. The Washington State Ferry system and the US Coast Guard have a problem with forgotten bicycles.  Over the last 18 months, 12 bicycles have been left aboard ferries, including three bike-share bikes. This turns out to be a rather big deal. Because a forgotten or abandoned bicycle might suggest that the owner could have gone overboard, it can trigger a search and rescue operation by Coast Guard and ferry personnel until the bicyclist can be confirmed safe.

The [Coast Guard issued a press release](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCG/bulletins/1e84f4c) on Monday noting that a ride-share bike recently left aboard a vessel led to $17,000 in helicopter and crew costs searching for a missing person along the ferry route when, in fact, no one had fallen overboard.  

“When bicycles are left behind on a ferry, the Coast Guard assumes the worst and searches in the event the bicycle operator may have fallen overboard,” explained Captain Linda Sturgis, commander for the Coast Guard’s Puget Sound sector, in a statement. “We join the Washington State Ferry system in requesting that bike-share users not bring rented bicycles on board the ferries, instead of leaving the bicycle at the pier and boarding as a walk-on passenger. For all passengers, we request you leave with the bikes you bring onboard.”
