We have posted about [Reid Stowe’s remarkable non-stop voyage](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/index.php?s=Reid+Stowe+Anne) of over 1100 days at sea.   Now that Reid has been home for several months, [Adam Sternbergh](http://nymag.com/nymag/10222/) writing in the [New Yorker](http://nymag.com/news/features/68316/) magazine has written a portrait of Reid’s voyage and the world he returned to after over three years at sea.  Worth a read.

*For two years, three months, and 26 days, while the world economy crashed, and Barack Obama ran for and won the U.S. presidency, and Sarah Palin debuted, and Spitzer resigned, and Sully landed, and Jon and Kate split, and Haiti crumbled, and Avatar opened, and Apple unveiled the iPad to the waiting world, Reid Stowe floated alone.*

*He didn’t know what was happening elsewhere. He didn’t care to know. He wasn’t lost or stranded. He was alone at sea by choice, piloting a 70-foot schooner, the Anne, which he’d built himself, undertaking a mission he’d been dreaming of and planning for most of his adult life: to sail on the ocean nonstop for 1,000 days.*
