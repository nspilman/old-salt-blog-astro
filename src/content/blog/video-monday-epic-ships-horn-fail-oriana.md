I am not sure when this actually takes place, but it seems like an appropriate video for a grey cold and rainy Monday.  Here is the [P&O Cruises *Oriana*](http://www.pocruises.com/cruise-ships/oriana2/overview/) departing Southampton’s City Cruise Terminal for a refit. As per the Rules of the Road, the captain gives one long blast of the ship’s horn to alert other vessels of the ship’s departure. Unfortunately, it is a considerably longer blast than anticipated. The horn gets stuck and blasts away for over 20 minutes. Here is a seven minute excerpt. Thanks to [Alaric Bond](https://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing the video along.
