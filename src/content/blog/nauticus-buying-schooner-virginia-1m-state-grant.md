The schooner *Virginia* is a reproduction of the last all sail pilot vessel built for the Virginia Pilot Association. She is 114′ on deck and sets 6,538 square feet of sail. The original ship sailed for the pilots from 1917-1926, training apprentice pilots in seamanship and navigation. The reproduction was built in Norfolk between 2002-2004.  The Nauticus Foundation plans to use the schooner as part of [Sail Nauticus](http://www.sailnauticus.org/), a program that gives underprivileged children around Hampton Roads access to the water.
