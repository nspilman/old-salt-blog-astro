Another year and I still did not manage to get up to Gloucester for the [Schooner Festival and Race](http://gloucesterschoonerfestival.net/). Oh well. Maybe next year I’ll drag my catboat up for the catboat races.  Congratulations to all the captains and crews who competed in the [Mayor’s Cup](http://www.northshorekid.com/event/mayors-cup-schooner-race) with special congratulations to Captain John Foss on [*American Eagle*](http://www.schooneramericaneagle.com/),  Captain Matt Suphin on [*Tyrone*](https://www.facebook.com/schooner.tyrone), and Captains Russ & Heidi Mead on *[Tillicum 1](http://gloucesterschoonerfestival.net/?attachment_id=457),* winners of the Esperato Cup, the Ned Cameron Cup and the Betty Ramsey Plate, respectively.

This morning was the start of the [Fisherman’s Cup Race](http://www.provincetownschoonerrace.com/nor.html) from Gloucester to Provincetown, which kicks off the [Great Provincetown Schooner Regatta](http://www.provincetownschoonerrace.com/index.html), which begins today and runs through Friday.  Click her for a [schedule of events](http://www.provincetownschoonerrace.com/events.html).
