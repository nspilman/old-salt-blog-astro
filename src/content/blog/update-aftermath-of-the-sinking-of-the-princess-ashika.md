![lifering](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/lifering.jpg)There will be a [preliminary hearing into the sinking of the ferry, *Princess Ashika*](http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=49327), next Thursday in Nuku’alofa by the Royal Commission set up by the Government to investigate the tragedy.

A [letter from Port Authority Port Authority general manager](http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2009/s2688615.htm), Lupeti Vi, to the Tongan Prime Minister, Feleti Sevele, revealed that welding repairs were carried out at night on the ill-fated ferry, without permission, to try to conceal how rusty the ferry was.  The letter also implied that the ferry might not have been insured.   According to the [Lloyd’s Marine Intelligence Unit database](http://www.lloydslistdcn.com.au/archive/2009/september/18/port-authority-feared-tongan-ferry-was-unsafe), Princess Ashika had no current International Safety Management or International Ship and Port Facility Security code documentation.

[A life buoy from the sunken *Princess Ashika*](http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=129662) was found floating in Fijian water near Levuka about 1000 kilometers from where the ferry sank early last month.  The *Princess Ashika* formerly was owned by the Patterson Shipping Company of Fiji, whose owners are originally from Levuka. The buoy is being returned to Tonga.
