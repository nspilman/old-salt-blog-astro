![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/popeye.jpg)We are a few days late in wishing the iconic cartoon character, [Popeye the sailorman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popeye), a happy birthday. (Frankly, I am not sure how one sends birthday wishes to a cartoon character, in any case.)

Popeye first appeared on January 17, 1929, as a bit player in [E.C. Segar’s comic strip “Thimble Theatre” in the New York Journal-American newspaper](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/popeye-gets-a-makeover-for-his-90th-birthday/2019/01/29/eede7df6-2350-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html?utm_term=.bd7f9b9d4dd4). He turned out to be highly popular and a few years later was given his own comic strip. 

**Exactly How Old is Popeye?** 

Popeye the sailor made his comic strip debut 1929, however, according to the artist, when he was created the character was [34 years old, born in a typhoon in Santa Monica, California](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/12/popeye-facts/). So, does that make him 90 or 124? Your choice.

**Who Inspired Popeye and OliveOyl?**

The character Popeye was said to have been inspired by [Frank “Rocky” Fiegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popeye#Cultural_origins_and_impact) who lived in Chester, Illinois, E.C. Segar’s hometown. He had a prominent chin, sinewy physique, characteristic pipe, and a propensity and skill for fist-fighting. [Olive Oyl](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/childrens-books/popeye-10-things-you-never-knew/) was said to be based on another of Segar’s neighbors – a very tall, slim woman named Dora Paskel, who usually wore her hair in a bun.

**Was Popeye a Coastie or a Navy Swabby?** 

Both and maybe neither. Popeye was, for much of his career, a merchant seaman. In a cartoon in 1937 cartoon, [Popeye the Sailor Man Meets Ali Baba’s Forty Thieves](https://youtu.be/miw_Jw7j2sE), Popeye appears to be in the Coast Guard. By 1941 with World war II raging, he appears to join the Navy and begins to dress in Navy whites. After the war, he gave up his merchant sailor togs and wore the Navy uniform even though he did not appear to be in the military. 

**Popeye’s Contribution the English Language**

The Popeye comic strip and movies are credited with contributing a [series of words to the English language,](http://blog.vision-strike-wear.com/was-popeye-a-coastie-or-a-navy-sailor/) including wimp, jeep, goon, and doofus. Not exactly Shakespeare but impressive for a comic book character.  

**Important Life Lesson from Popeye**
