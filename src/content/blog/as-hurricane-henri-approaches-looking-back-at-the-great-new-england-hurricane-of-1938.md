![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hurricane38.jpg)[Hurricane Henri is expected to make landfall](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/20/1029626711/new-england-is-under-a-hurricane-watch-for-the-first-time-in-years) on the eastern portion of Long Island or in southern New England on Sunday afternoon. It will be the first hurricane to strike New England in 30 years. My wife and I cut short a vacation in the Adirondacks today to do what we could to batten down our sailboat on a mooring in Oyster Bay, Long Island. (We will keep our fingers crossed until at least Monday.)

The current models show Hurricane Henri coming ashore near the Hamptons on Long Island as a Category 1 storm. While Hurricane Henri is a serious threat, with luck, its impact will pale in comparison to the Category 3, [1938 Great New England Hurricane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_New_England_hurricane), also referred to as the Yankee Clipper, and the Long Island Express Hurricane, which also made landfall near the Hamptons.

It is estimated that the 1938 hurricane killed 682 people, damaged or destroyed more than 57,000 homes, and caused property losses estimated at $306 million ($4.7 billion in 2017.) It remains the most powerful and deadliest hurricane in recorded New England history. 

As we hunker down and wait for Henri to arrive, Here is a short video made by the [Works Progress Administration (WPA)](https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/works-progress-administration) about the Great New England Hurricane of 1938.
