A 23 year old woman reportedly fell overboard into the North Sea just after 8.30pm on Monday night from the [Princess Seaways DFDS ferry](http://www.dfdsseaways.co.uk/onboard-our-ferries/newcastle-amsterdam/ship-overview/princess-seaways/) bound from from Newcastle to Ijmuiden. The woman was reportedly lighting a cigarette at the rail when she fell. The ferry reversed course and successfully rescued the woman using the ferry’s rescue boats. She was subsequently airlifted by helicopter to to Scarborough Hospital before being released.  Yet another reason not to smoke.  Congratulations to the officers and crew of the *Princess Seaways* for their speed and professionalism in executing a successful night rescue at sea, which is no easy task.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for passing the news along.
