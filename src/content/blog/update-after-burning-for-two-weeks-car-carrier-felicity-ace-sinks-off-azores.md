The car carrier [*Felicity Ace*](https://www.fleetmon.com/maritime-news/2022/37269/mol-car-carrier-fire-abandoned-atlantic/), carrying upwards of 4,000 vehicles, including more than 1,000 Porsches and 200 Bentleys, [caught fire in the Atlantic off the Azores](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/02/car-carrier-felicity-ace-on-fire-and-adrift-in-the-atlantic/) on February 16. After almost two weeks ablaze, the fire appeared to be under control. The ship was still quite hot, but smoke no longer billowed from the cargo decks. Then, yesterday morning, while under tow by the salvage tug *Bear,* the 650-foot-long car carrier capsized and sank.

The Portuguese navy said in a statement, “This morning, during the towing process, which had begun on Feb. 24, the ship ‘*Felicity Ace*’ lost stability and sank some 25 nautical miles outside of the limits of Portugal’s exclusive economic zone, in an area with a depth of about \[9,842 feet\].”

As reported by the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/03/01/cargo-ship-felicity-ace-porsche-cars-sinks/), European environmental groups and government agencies are monitoring the situation, the Portuguese navy said. The ship had been carrying about 2,200 tons of fuel and 2,200 tons of oil — along with other pollutants, such as metallic parts, plastics, electrical wires, and paint.

Estimates of the value of the vehicles lost in the fire and sinking have ranged as high as [$500 million.](https://www.reinsurancene.ws/burning-car-carrier-felicity-ace-could-be-500m-cargo-loss-says-skytek/)
