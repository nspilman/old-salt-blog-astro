![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pacific-zircon.jpg)Last week, we [posted about the drone attack](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/11/product-tanker-pacific-zircon-hit-in-drone-attack-off-oman/) on the 50,000 DWT product tanker [*Pacific Zircon*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:755720/mmsi:636015704/imo:9539573/vessel:PACIFIC_ZIRCON), off the coast of Oman. Investigators sent aboard to assess the damage and to collect debris from the drone determined that the tanker was struck by an Iranian Shahed-136 drone, the same kind of bomb-carrying drone Iran has supplied to Russia in its war on Ukraine. Iranian drones were used by Yemeni rebels to attack Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates earlier this year, the Navy said.

A Navy [statement](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/433768/us-navy-analysis-confirms-iranian-link-drone-attack) concluded that on Nov. 15, the explosive-laden aerial drone attacked Pacific Zircon at approximately 7:30 p.m. in the Northern Arabian Sea, tearing a 30-inch-wide hole into the back of the ship while subsequently penetrating and damaging internal compartments. The UAV’s explosive impact also damaged a shipboard boiler, potable water tank and life raft.

“The Iranian attack on a commercial tanker transiting international waters was deliberate, flagrant and dangerous, endangering the lives of the ship’s crew and destabilizing maritime security in the Middle East,” said Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command.

The *Pacific Zircon* is operated by Singapore-based [Eastern Pacific Shipping](https://www.epshipping.com.sg/), which is a company ultimately owned by Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer. Israeli and U.S. officials said at the time of the attack that they suspected Iran was behind it.
