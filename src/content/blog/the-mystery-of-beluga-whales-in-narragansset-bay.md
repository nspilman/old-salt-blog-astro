Almost a week ago, three beluga whales were spotted in Rhode Island’s Narraganset Bay. Normally the white whales would be expected to stay much farther north.  Teams of scientists from the [Mystic Aquarium & Institute for Exploration](http://www.mysticaquarium.org/) watched video of the whales and traveled to Jamestown, RI, to see the beluga whales first hand, by boat.  Why the whales are so far south is a bit of a mystery.  They usually do not travel much farther south than the St. Lawrence river in Canada. As reported by [WNPR](http://wnpr.org/post/rhode-islands-beluga-whale-mystery-continues):  *“The fact that there are three whales is even more unusual,” said Tracy Romano, a biologist at Mystic Aquarium….*

*“Well, certainly they could have gotten lost. Off track. Found themselves down here. Many populations of beluga whales actually migrate to warmer waters and estuaries during the summer months,” Romano said. “These animals really seem to be curious animals. They seem to be feeding on something. When we’ve been watching them they’ve been staying in one area. “Milling about” is what we call it,” she continued. “So, it’s not clear what they’re doing, but it seems that they’re out of harm’s way. They’re feeding. They’re being beluga whales.”* 

*Romano said biologists have gotten pictures and video of the whales. They’ll send that info to scientists who have cataloged whale populations in the St. Lawrence River, and with a little bit of luck, Romano said biologists may be able to get a match. “And be able to tell us male versus female, about how old they are, what their behavior patterns have been, if it’s a female, if they’ve had a successful calf,” or if the whales are a family.* 

*Last year, one beluga whale was found in the Taunton River in Massachusetts.*
