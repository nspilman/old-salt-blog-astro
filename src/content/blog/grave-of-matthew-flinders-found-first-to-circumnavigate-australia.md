Captain Matthew Flinders

Yesterday we [posted about the replica of Captain Cook’s HMS *Endeavour*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/01/replica-of-hms-endeavour-to-circumnavigate-australai/) which will be circumnavigating Australia to commemorate the 250th-anniversary of Cook’s arrival. Some critics have noted that Captain Cook did not actually sail around Australia.

Coincidentally and almost simultaneously, archaeologists in London identified the remains of [Captain Matthew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Flinders) Flinders, who, as commander of HMS *Investigator*, did lead the first circumnavigation of Australia. His voyage confirmed that Australia was a continent. Later, his account of the expedition, [A Voyage to Terra Australis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Voyage_to_Terra_Australis), helped to popularize the name Australia.

Captain Flinders’s remains were identified in the excavation of the cemetery at St James’s Gardens, where he was buried in July of 1814. [BBC reports](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-46974247): *It was known Captain Flinders was among the thousands of people buried at the site, which was built over when Euston station was expanded in the 19th Century but it was unclear whether his body or others would be able to be identified.* 

*The discovery so early in the dig has thrilled archaeologists who were not confident they would find Captain Flinders among the 40,000 people interred there, HS2 said.* *They were able to identify his remains by the lead breastplate placed on top of his coffin.*

Flinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810. In the second voyage, in the sloop [*Norfolk*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_\(1798_sloop\)), Flinders, and [George Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bass) confirmed that Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania) was an island. In the third voyage, Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia, accompanied by [Bungaree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungaree "Bungaree"), an Aboriginal Australian from the Kuringgai people of the Broken Bay area north of Sydney.

In his account of his voyages, Flinders argued for the name Australia for the continent which the Dutch referred to as New Holland. Cook had claimed the eastern portion of the continent and named it New South Wales. Flinders was not the first to use the word Australia, but he applied it specifically to the continent and not the whole South Pacific region.
