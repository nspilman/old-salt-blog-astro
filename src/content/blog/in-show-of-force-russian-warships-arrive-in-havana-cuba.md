![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/06/russianfrigatecuba.jpg)On Wednesday four Russian naval vessels; a nuclear-powered submarine, a frigate, an oil tanker, and a rescue tug; arrived in Cuba for military drills.

The vessels’ visit has been seen as a show of force amid Moscow’s tensions with the West over the war in Ukraine, according to the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg66g0neweko). The ships anchored in Havana Bay – some 90 miles (145km) from the US state of Florida.

Russia’s defence ministry says the [Admiral Gorshkov frigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral_Gorshkov-class_frigate) and the [Kazan submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_submarine_Kazan_\(K-561\)) both can carry advanced weapons, including hypersonic missiles Zircon. They earlier conducted missile drills in the Atlantic.

But Cuba’s foreign ministry says none of the vessels has nuclear arms on board, and their five-day visit does not pose a threat to the region.

US officials have played down the significance of the arrival of the Russian ships. “We of course take it seriously, but these exercises don’t pose a threat to the United States,” the Pentagon said. Nevertheless, on Thursday, the US Navy’s Southern Command said the USS *Helena*, a [nuclear-powered fast attack submarine, had been moved](https://apnews.com/article/russia-cuba-us-submarine-ukraine-bac0519f4fdbe30a5ef210447d50a671) into the waters near the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

US officials say they are closely monitoring the visit. The US Navy also used sea drones to shadow the Russian vessels as they got close to Cuba, BBC’s US partner CBS reports.
