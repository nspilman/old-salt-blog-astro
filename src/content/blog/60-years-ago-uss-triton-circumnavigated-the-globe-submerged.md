Voyage of USS Triton

A good story for the lockdown.

In February 1960, the [USS *Triton*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Triton_\(SSRN-586\)) set out on a most unusual shakedown cruise. The nuclear-powered radar picket submarine sailed from New London, CT, and returned in May, having circumnavigated the world submerged, becoming the first submarine in history to do so.

In an overall voyage of 84 days, the circumnavigation itself, starting at and returning to St. Peter and Paul Rocks, took 60 days and 21 hours, traveling 26,723 nautical miles at an average speed of 18 knots. USS *Triton’*s course retraced Ferdinand Magellan’s historic first circumnavigation.

The *Triton* was commanded by [Captain Edward Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_L._Beach_Jr.), the decorated World War II submarine commander and best selling novelist. 

The project was originally dubbed Project Magellan but finally code-named [Project Sandblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sandblast) on the basis that it would “take a lot of sand” on the crew’s part to be successful. “Sand” was also Captain Beach’s code name during the voyage.

On May 13, 1960 the New York Times wrote: *The first underwater circumnavigation of the globe is a triumph of human prowess and engineering skill, a feat which the United States Navy can rank as one of its bright victories in man’s ultimate conquest of the seas.*

Most of the official celebrations for Triton’s submerged circumnavigation were canceled, however, due to the uproar over the [shooting down of a US U-2 spy plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_U-2_incident) by the Soviets, which sparked a major Soviet-American diplomatic crisis that led to the collapse of the 1960 Paris Summit.

Here is a short documentary from 1961 of the circumnavigation of the USS *Triton*.
