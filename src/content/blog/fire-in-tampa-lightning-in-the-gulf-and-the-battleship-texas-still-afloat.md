Sophie Oldendorff on fire in Tampa

Busy days in the Gulf of Mexico.  On the surface above the continuing Deepwater Horizon disaster yesterday, a drill  ship attempting to contain the oil was struck by lightning and caught on fire shutting down containment operations.  Reportedly, operations resumed today.   [BP: Oil containment efforts resume after ship fire](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100615/ap_on_bi_ge/us_gulf_oil_spill_fire).

Not too far away last weekend, the battleship *[USS Texas](http://www.usstexasbb35.com/)* came close to sinking in the Houston Ship Channel.   A stuffed rag and backup pump reportedly kept her afloat. [Battleship Texas saved from near-sinking](http://www.kens5.com/home/96430024.html).

And on the other side of the Gulf today in Tampa the 742-foot *Sophie Oldendorff’*s self-unloading gear caught fire and took 100 firemen in 24 trucks and one fireboat four hours to get under control.  [Blaze on freighter at Port of Tampa finally under control](http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/jun/16/161415/crane-fire-port-tampa/news-breaking/)
