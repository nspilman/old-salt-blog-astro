T![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/QueenElizabeth2Dubai.jpg)he *QE2* may now be a dead ship.  The [MS *Queen Elizabeth 2*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_2) was purchased back in 2008 for conversion to a luxury hotel in Dubai, but a worldwide recession ended those plans.  Since then there are have been a variety of reports, including a [more modest hotel conversion in Dubai](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/07/dubai-unveils-more-modest-plans-for-qe2-hotel/), a luxury hotel conversation in Asia and even a scheme to bring the ship the the [Thames River in London](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/01/classic-liner-queen-elizabeth-2-bound-for-the-scrapyard-or-the-thames/). Nothing came to fruition and last December we posted of the “[Queen Elizabeth 2 Rotting Away in Dubai](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/12/update-queen-elizabeth-2-rotting-away-in-dubai/).”

[Now reports from Dubai](http://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/236920447/qe2-declared-a-dead-ship-moved-into-holding-area-in-mina-rashid) say that the once proud Cunard flagship is “a floating wreck” which has been moved from her berth in Dubai Drydocks World to a holding berth in Port Rashid.  It appears that the *Queen Elizabeth 2* is officially dead, along with all plans for her restoration and move to an unnamed city in Asia, according to a source at Drydocks World. Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing the news along.
