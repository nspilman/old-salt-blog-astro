There is a lot going on in the cruise world these days. There is all the talk about returning the [SS *United States*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/02/will-the-ss-united-states-sail-again-crystal-cruises-tosses-a-life-line/) to service, although probably without a steam plant or much of the original ship coming along for the ride. Then there is the allegedly ongoing project to build a [replica of the *RMS Titanic*,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/02/titanic-ii-not-quite-exact-replica-sail-2018/) which will be exactly like the original except for more beam, no steam, and no shear, as well as more lifeboats, and, at least, one fewer iceberg. Here, however, is a plan for a ship that would top them all — a ten stack luxury superliner out of Germany.

At this point, it is tempting to start riffing on the German shipowner, Drumpf Line and their “yuge” ship (although the stacks, like ten fingers, do look on the short and stubby side.)  The photo above is, in fact, an April Fools photo from Germany in 1938, reprinted by Life magazine. The copy below the photo reads:

“*Its launching was announced for April 1. The photographer christened the ship President Roosevelt, declared that among its many superlative features was an auto track on which car-crazy Americans could race just to keep their hands in*.”
