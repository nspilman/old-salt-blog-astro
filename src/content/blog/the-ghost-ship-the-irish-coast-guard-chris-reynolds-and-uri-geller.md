I may owe Chris Reynolds an apology.  In a reply to a comment about our post, [Lyubov Orlova, Ghost Ship Crewed by Cannibal Rats Drifting Toward the UK — Phony Hysteria on a Slow News Day?](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/01/lyubov-orlova-ghost-ship-crewed-by-cannibal-rats-drifting-toward-the-uk-slow-news-day/#comment-192217), I suggested that Reynolds, Director, Irish Coast Guard, “appears to one of those helping to fuel the hysteria, not that the media needs much help.” That was probably unfair as we later received a comment from Chris Reynolds, as follows:

*actually I never said I thought it was still afloat since the EPIRBs went off but the fact is no one cant prove it sunk. the ship had a number of EPIRBS in lifeboats we are told so the signals are only an indication. However professionally speaking its demise is pretty certain. the rats thing came from an Icelandic April Fools prank and some creative journalism. There ya go. Be careful believing what you read.*

*PS We are not annoyed at Canada as this is such a rare event.*

Of course, this raises the question, “was this actually Chris Reynolds, Director, Irish Coast Guard?” There are many Chris Reynolds in the world and, no doubt, many who would claim the name. As the commenter noted “*Be careful believing what you read.”*  

Consulting my old friend Google,  I discovered that Chris Reynolds, Director, Irish Coast Guard has a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/chris.reynolds.3363?fref=ts) where he recently commented, “*story with cannibal, ghost ship and rats was bound to go viral even if idiotic*.”  I also learned that in addition to the British MCA, which said regarding the “Ghost ship “there is no evidence to suggest it is still afloat,” that the Irish Coast Guard also believes that the ship has sunk.

For those who still think the ship is out there, however, there is a good news.  Uri Gellar, the “magician, television personality, and self-proclaimed psychic” has offered to help find the ship.

[‘Cannibal-rat ghost ship’ has sunk, says Coastguard; Uri Gellar says he can find it](http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/cannibal-rat-ghost-ship-has-sunk-says-coastguard-uri-gellar-says-he-can-find-it-620686.html#.UuJ3T3UbPqo.facebook)

*The Irish Coastguard teamed up with the satellite tracking company and spent two months trying to locate the 100-metre vessel.   However Chris Reynolds of the Irish Coastguard said his theory is that the ship sank somewhere in the Atlantic, thanks to hurricanes Sandy and Catherine.  He conceded though that: “We can’t prove that.”*

*This morning, psychic [Uri Geller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uri_Geller) said he will help to find the ship, which has been valued at around €1m.*
