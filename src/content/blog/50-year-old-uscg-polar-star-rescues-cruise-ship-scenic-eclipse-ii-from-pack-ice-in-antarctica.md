![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2026/01/polarstar2.jpg)Last month, the US Coast Guard Cutter *[Polar Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Polar_Star)* (WAGB 10)  began icebreaking operations in the Southern Ocean in support of [Operation Deep Freeze 2026](https://www.news.uscg.mil/Press-Releases/Article/4385905/us-coast-guard-cutter-polar-star-marks-50-years-of-service-begins-operation-dee/#:~:text=23%2C%202026-,U.S.%20Coast%20Guard%20Cutter%20Polar%20Star%20marks%2050%20years%20of,ship%20trapped%20in%20pack%20ice.). The deployment also marked the cutter’s 50th year of commissioned service.

This milestone was further commemorated by the *Polar Star* rescuing the  Australian-owned cruise ship [*Scenic Eclipse II*,](https://www.swoop-antarctica.com/cruises/ships/eclipse-ii?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=23191574292&utm_adgroup=193361009171&utm_content=&utm_term=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=23191574292&gbraid=0AAAAADxjfc94bWrQXzf7zCT5YfBcdd3bj&gclid=Cj0KCQiAkPzLBhD4ARIsAGfah8iysRd9OOmQxfLuwfR4r9MOREJ_mLf8WF4OqkEMAamKjU1hhTT96hIaAv7TEALw_wcB) which became trapped in pack ice, eight nautical miles from McMurdo Sound. After receiving a call from the distressed cruise ship shortly before midnighton January 17, the *Polar Star* broke the ice surrounding the *Scenic Eclipse II* by encircling it twice before escorting it for four nautical miles until it reached open water.

“I am constantly amazed at this crew’s tremendous energy and enthusiasm,” said Capt. Jeff Rasnake, *Polar Star*’s commanding officer. “Despite the many challenges associated with getting and keeping this ship on mission, they remain eternally positive and committed to meeting the high standards we’ve set for ourselves.”

The cutter supports Operation Deep Freeze 2026, an ongoing military operation that helps the National Science Foundation’s U.S. Antarctic Program to conduct research. The effort involves search and rescue, airdrops, transportation help, aeromedical evacuations, and breaking ice for fuel and cargo deliveries, among other operations.

The cutter has deployed 29 times in support of the Antarctic Program and is the United States’ only active heavy icebreaker.

Commissioned Jan. 17, 1976, *Polar Star* is the nation’s only active heavy icebreaker and has served as a cornerstone of U.S. presence in the polar regions. For five decades, the cutter has executed missions ranging from Antarctic resupply and search and rescue to environmental protection and national defense.
