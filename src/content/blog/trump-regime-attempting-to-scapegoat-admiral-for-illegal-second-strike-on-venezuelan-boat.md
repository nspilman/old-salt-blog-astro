![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/12/hegsethboat.jpg)The criminal clown circus that is the Trump regime continues to spin out of control with lethal consequences.

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/11/28/hegseth-kill-them-all-survivors-boat-strike/) reports that during an attack on an unidentified Venezuelan vessel on September 2, the US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a spoken directive “to kill everybody,” according to two people with direct knowledge of the operation.

After an initial rocket attack on the craft left two survivors clinging to the burning wreckage, the Special Operations commander overseeing the — the opening salvo in the Trump administration’s war on suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere — ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth’s instructions. The two men were blown apart in the water.

The alleged traffickers posed no imminent threat of attack against the United States and were not, as the Trump administration has tried to argue, in an “armed conflict” with the U.S., officials and experts have said. Because there is no legitimate war between the two sides, killing any of the men in the boats “amounts to murder,” said Todd Huntley, a former military lawyer who advised Special Operations forces for seven years at the height of the U.S. counterterrorism campaign.

When word of the illegal attack leaked out, Secretary Hegseth attempted to blame Adm Frank M Bradley, who oversees U.S. Special Operations Command, for the attack. Hegseth, [writing on social media](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1995643490152128919) Monday night, said he stands by the admiral “and the combat decisions he has made — on the September 2 mission and all others since.

[Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle pushed back](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5630733-trump-administration-boat-strike-blame-house-democrats/) against Hegseth’s attempt to make Admiral Bradley a scapegoat.  The Senate Armed Services Committee said it would be “conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts” related to the 2 September strikes.

The Republican chairman of the committee, Senator Roger Wicker, said on Monday that the lawmakers are planning to interview the “admiral who was in charge of the operation”. He added that it was also seeking audio and video to “see what the orders were”.

The Armed Services Committee in the House of Representatives also said it would lead a “bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question”.

“This administration has a long history of asking people to do things that are reckless or lawless, and then throwing them under the bus and shifting blame,” Rep. [Jason Crow](https://thehill.com/people/jason-crow/) (D-Colo.) said. “And there’s no doubt that that seems to be what’s happening here.”

President Donald Trump subsequently said [he didn’t know anything about a second strike](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2025/dec/02/trump-says-he-and-hegseth-didnt-know-about-second-strike-on-alleged-venezuelan-drug-boat-video) on the alleged Venezuelan drug boat. He also stood by his defence secretary, saying Pete Hegseth didn’t know a US Navy admiral had ordered a second strike. Hegseth also denied knowledge of it, but stated the admiral ‘had the complete authority’ to launch it.

Since the September 2 attack, the Trump regime has attacked more than 20 vessels and killed at least 83 people without providing any evidence that the boats under attack were smuggling drugs or that the sailors being killed were “narco-terrorists.”

These airstrikes have been [condemned by  Volker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166234) as violations of international human rights law. He urged the US to halt its “unacceptable” operations and take measures to prevent the “extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them.”  Notably, the [governments of the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and Australia](https://time.com/7333231/countries-stop-sharing-intelligence-with-united-states-amid-boat-strikes-caribbean/) have stopped sharing intelligence with the US over the illegal targeting of the Venezuelan and Colombian boats.
