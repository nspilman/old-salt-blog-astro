Up to 80% of illicit drugs enter the US by maritime routes. (We recently posted about the ongoing battle against cocaine being imported into the US by [narco submarines](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/12/battle-narco-submarines/).) Here is another example, although it does not involve submersibles. It involves a sea turtle. Sailors from a US Coast Guard Cutter patrolling in the eastern Pacific recently [rescued a sea turtle](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/coast-guard-frees-sea-turtle-trapped-floating-cocaine-bales-n830816) that had become entangled in lines holding together 26 bales of cocaine, weighing around 1,800 kilos. One source put the value of the cocaine at $53 million. The Coast Gaurd freed the turtle which had significant chafing on its neck and flippers. They also recovered the cocaine.
