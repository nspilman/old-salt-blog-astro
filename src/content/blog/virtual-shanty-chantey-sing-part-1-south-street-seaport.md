![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/newyorkpacket.jpg)New York’s [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/)‘s monthly Chantey Sing is returning virtually, this Sunday, May 3rd from 2-4pm.

From the Seaport announcement: From our living rooms and kitchens, and even from the deck of [*Wavertree*](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/visit/street-of-ships/wavertree/), join our round-robin of shared songs, featuring members of the New York Packet and friends. Listen in, lead or request a song, and belt out the choruses for your neighbors to hear during a Virtual Chantey Sing this Sunday, May 3, 2020 from 2-4pm. The event is FREE. Sign up here to receive the Zoom link 24 hours prior: [www.seaportmuseum.org/ChanteySingMay](https://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/eventReg?oeidk=a07eh1vmql6a694b090&oseq=&c=&ch=).

The May singing session will be moderated by Bonnie Milner of The Johnson Girls; Dan Milner, song collector and author; and other members of The New York Packet, a collection of traditional chantey singers in the New York area. The New York Packet was established over 30 years ago as the official maritime singing group of South Street Seaport Museum.

South Street Seaport Museum generously hosts Chantey Sings on the first Sunday of each month from May to September. The sings move to dry dock on first Sundays from October to April at John Street Methodist Church.

Though singers and song leaders alike will be logging in remotely, Seaport Museum’s Rigger Siyu Chen will take time from his duties maintaining and preserving the South Street Seaport Museum’s fleet to join on Zoom from the deck of *Wavertree*, with the East River in the background. All viewers are welcome to lead songs, sing-along, or just listen and enjoy.
