*The city’s docks and quaysides will again ring with the sounds and songs of the Golden Age of Sail in a musical celebration of Liverpool’s maritime heritage.*

*A highlight of the city’s Spring on the Waterfront festival, it will feature all-day performances taking place on a floating stage in Salthouse Dock, Merseyside Maritime Museum and on neighbouring ships and quaysides.*

*Performers include The Staten Island Ferrymen, a super-group especially formed for the festival, comprising celebrated songwriter and former Liverpool Spinner Hughie Jones, Bob Conroy and Norm Pederson, of American sea song group Stout, and virtuoso bass player Dean Ravera, who performs with Northumbrian folk group The Unthanks. Local artists include The Liverpool Shanty Kings, formed from the city’s longest established folk group, The Travelling People, and Liverpool/Irish ballad singers and musicians The Liverpool Crew.*

*The event is supported by Liverpool City Council, European Regional Development Fund and Liverpool Vision.*
