![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/projectnatick.jpg)Although we speak of the internet as being in “the cloud,” an [estimated 95 percent of internet communication](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/03/forget-the-cloud-the-internet-is-beneath-the-sea/) is carried on cables on the bottom of the sea. Now Microsoft is exploring moving computer data centers beneath the sea, as well. Microsoft has recently dropped a 40-foot long data-center pod about 100 ft below the surface onto the seafloor off the coast from the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney, north of Scotland. The pod is phase 2 of [Project Natick](https://natick.research.microsoft.com/). Microsoft previously dropped a slightly smaller 30-foot Natick pod off the coast of California in 2016 

[Quartz](https://qz.com/1298583/microsoft-is-now-operating-a-data-center-under-the-sea/) reports: *The logic is sound: Bringing data centers close to hubs of computing power benefits customers, enabling smoother web surfing or game playing by cutting down the back-and-forth between users and servers. Microsoft says nearly half the world’s population lives within 150 km (120 miles) of the ocean. And because oceans are uniformly cool below a certain depth, keeping the machines under the sea would cut down the cooling costs that make up a large chunk of the operating budget of data centers.*

*The Project Natick data center is made up of 864 servers packed in a 40-foot container that now sits about 22 km (14 miles) from the coast. That’s a tiny fraction of some of the huge servers—covering hundreds of thousands of square feet—that tech companies like Microsoft operate. But it may be enough to do a pilot test, and prove that the server could be deployed at commercial scale. …*

*The Orkney islands happen to also generate more than 100% of their energy from wind, solar, and tidal sources. That means Microsoft’s data center, which has its electricity supply delivered through an undersea cable, is also not adding to the ever-growing carbon emissions that are driving climate change.*
