A short video of the Iowa-class battleship [USS *New Jersey*](https://www.battleshipnewjersey.org/) on the blocks in drydock at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.  As noted by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/nyregion/battleship-new-jersey-repairs.html), no other U.S. battleship served in more military campaigns. [Christened on the first anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1942](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/12/one-year-after-pearl-harbor-launching-of-the-battleship-uss-new-jersey-december-7-1942/), she went on to earn 19 battle stars during 21 years of active service. Roughly 45,000 sailors and Marines served on her decks in World War II, the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the Lebanese Civil War and the Iran-Iraq Tanker War. After an illustrious career, she was retired as a museum ship in Camden, NJ in 2001.

The USS *New Jersey* is now undergoing a 60-day docking for preventive maintenance on Dock #3, the same dock she was [launched from on Dec. 7, 1942](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/12/one-year-after-pearl-harbor-launching-of-the-battleship-uss-new-jersey-december-7-1942/). This is the first drydocking of the ship in 32 years.
