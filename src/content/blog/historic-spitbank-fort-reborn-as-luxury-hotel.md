Located a mile out to the sea, the fort provides a peaceful getaway for vacationers searching for an island escape. The hotel provides boat transfers from nearby Portsmouth and Gosport in Hampshire, according to the Daily Mail. And the luxurious accommodation start even before guests set foot at the fort. Guests are served champagne and canapés at Spitbank’s own departure lounge before their private boat transfer.

“Even though we are only a mile away from land people feel like they are going on a long journey when they come here,” Mark Watts, general manager of the hotel, told the Daily Mail.

Exclusive use of the fort (sleeps up to 16) from around $7,690, and individual rooms are available on certain dates from $565 per person.
