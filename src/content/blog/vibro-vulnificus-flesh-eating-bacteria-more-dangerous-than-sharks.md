Is it safe to go into the water? [Officials with the Florida Department of Health are warning that vibro vulnificus](http://www.modvive.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/061714-Vibrio.pdf), a flesh eating bacteria, poses a threat to those who eat uncooked seafood or go into the state ocean water with cuts or open wounds. Those with compromised immune systems are at the greatest risk of infection.  Vibrio vulnificus is a bacterium found in all  warm coastal waters of the United States.  This year, [12 cases have been identified by health officials, including 3 fatalities.](http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/florida-vibrio-vulnificus-update-12-cases-reported-to-date-21349/)  In 2013, Florida reported 41 cases and 11 deaths from the bacteria.

To put this into context, there were no fatal shark attacks in Florida in 2013.  [The last reported shark fatality in the state was in 2005.](http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/statistics/gattack/mapfl.htm)  In the more than 130 years between 1882 and 2013, there have been a total of 11 confirmed deaths from shark attacks in the state of Florida, as compared to 11 deaths from vibro vulnificus infection in the year 2013, alone.  Vibro vulnificus is many times more dangerous than sharks.

As reported by the [UPI:](http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/07/29/Florida-health-officials-warn-of-flesh-eating-bacteria/7721406667711/)  *Vibrio vulnificus is a relative of the bacterium that causes Cholera. If swimmers ingest infected salt water, the bacterium can cause stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. But it is most dangerous when it invades the skin via open wounds, which can lead to “skin breakdown and ulceration,” [according to the CDC.](http://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/vibriov.html)*

*Most infections are successfully treated with a course of antibiotics, but severe skin infections can result in amputation; and for those with weakened immune systems, the infections can prove fatal.*

Unfortunately, [Florida tests the water quality at only 41% of its beaches.](http://www.nrdc.org/water/oceans/ttw/fl.asp)
