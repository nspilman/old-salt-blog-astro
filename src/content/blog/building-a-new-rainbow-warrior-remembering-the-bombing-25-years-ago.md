Rainbow Warrior III

Twenty five years ago this week, French government agents attached limpit mines to the hull of the [Greenpeace ship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_Rainbow_Warrior) *[Rainbow Warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_Rainbow_Warrior)*, in Auckland harbor in New Zealand to stop the ship from protesting French nuclear testing in [Moruroa.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moruroa) The exploding mines sank the *Rainbow Warrior*, killing Fernando Pereira, a photographer.  Two French agents were arrested by the New Zealand Police and were charged with arson and murder for which they would serve only two years.

Last week Greenpeace  commemorated the anniversary of the bombing by starting construction of a new, low-carbon, *[Rainbow Warrior III](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/greenpeace-orders-technologica/).*

[Greenpeace begins construction of new Rainbow Warrior, marking 25th anniversary of bombing](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/Greenpeace-begins-construction-of-new-Rainbow-Warrior-marking-25th-anniversary-of-bombing/)  
  
*The new Rainbow Warrior will be the first purpose built ship in the Greenpeace fleet. Designed as a sailing ship, her striking A-frame masts will rise 54m above the water, helping Greenpeace reduce its carbon footprint and serve as an example to others of smart environmental investment.*

*Among other exciting design features is the built-in satellite uplink, which will have a 24/7 broadband connection, providing the world with incredible access, images and contact with the crew as the ship carries out her missions. It will also allow many millions of people to join as virtual rainbow warriors. Specially designed cranes will allow for the rapid deployment of inflatables – a key tool in confronting environmental abuse. The ship will set sail next year, in time for the 40th anniversary of the founding of Greenpeace.*
