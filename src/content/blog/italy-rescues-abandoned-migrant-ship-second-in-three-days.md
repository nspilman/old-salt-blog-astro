The Italian Coast Guard has taken control of *[Ezadeen](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/shipid:763967/mmsi:667002119/imo:6614279/vessel:EZADEEN)*, a 240′ long, 50 year old cattle carrier registered in Sierra Leone, with 450 migrants aboard off the southern coast of Italy, near Crotone. The crew of the ship abandoned it and its passengers. The ship had been put on a collision course with the Italian coast but had run out of fuel and was left drifting. Some reports say that the migrants aboard the ship had also run out of food and water.  In high winds and rough seas, the Italian Coast Guard dropped rescue personnel on board the ship by helicopter. The first vessel to reach the *Ezadeen* was an Icelandic Coast Guard patrol boat participating in joint exercises.  After several hours of effort in high seas, the Icelandic vessel was able to secure a tow line to the *Ezadeen,* and begin to tow the ship toward the Italian port of Corigliano Calabro.

This is the second migrant ship to be left abandoned off the Italian coast in the last three days. As [we posted on Wednesday](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/12/blue-sky-m-abandoned-migrant-ship-on-autopilot/), the Italian Coast Guard intercepted the *Blue Sky M,* a freighter with more than 700 migrants aboard which had been left heading for the Italian coast under autopilot aft the crew of traffickers abandoned the ship.  The ship was taken under tow and safely taken to the Italian port of Gallipoli.

As reported by the New York Times:

*The use of larger vessels seems to mark a new tactic by traffickers in the Mediterranean, seeking ever greater profits from people desperate to flee war zones, chaos and repressive regimes and prepared to pay thousands a dollars each to do so.*

*“We are aware of at least four incidents in the last two months where people smugglers cram hundreds of migrants and refugees in big cargo boats and then send them uncrewed in the direction of Italy,” said William Spindler, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency.*

*“In the past they did exactly the same thing with smaller vessels like fishing vessels and dinghies,” he told BBC radio. “But it seems now they are going for bigger boats like cargo boasts,” and “the money involved is huge.”*

*The danger, he said, was that, with no one at the tiller, the vessels could “crash against the coast, and many lives will be lost.”*
