*Admiral Lord Nelson led HMS Victory out of a few sticky situations, but now the ship finds itself in a bit of a jam.*

*Off-cuts of wood from the Portsmouth-based historic ship have been infused with fruit and brandy and processed to make a plum and oak flavoured jam.   Jars of the spread can be bought for £5 from a London art gallery – and without a splinter in sight.*  
  
*The Victory oak for the preserve came from mini replicas of Nelson’s coffin made in 2005 for the 200th anniversary of the Royal Navy’s triumph over French and Spanish navies at the Battle of Trafalgar.*

*Makers Bompas and Parr made the jam for the Surreal House art exhibition at the Barbican Centre in London.     The Occult Jam range has made headlines as it also includes milk jam infused with a speck of Princess Diana’s hair, as well as an absinthe and pineapple jam with sand from the Pyramids.*
