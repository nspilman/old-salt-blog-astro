![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/09/harborseal2.jpg)While many have been focused on the massive die-offs of fish and sea life off the South Florida coastline triggered by a combined outbreak of red tide and blue-green algae, all is not well along the New England coast either. An [unusually large number of seals have been dying](http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/08/31/noaa-seal-deaths-mortality-event) this summer.

Close to 600 harbor and gray seals have died along the coasts of Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts since July. The unexpectedly high death rate has caused the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to declare a pinniped [unusual mortality event (UME)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/marine-mammal-unusual-mortality-events) along the Northeast Coast.

NOAA investigators are trying to identify the cause of the deaths but so far have no clear answer. [NOAA reports](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/2018-pinniped-unusual-mortality-event-along-northeast) that “preliminary testing has found some seals positive for either avian influenza or phocine distemper virus. We have many more samples to process and analyze, so it is still too soon to determine if either or both of these viruses are the primary cause of the mortality event.”

The unexplained deaths come after a significant [recovery of the seal populations, particularly the gray seals](https://www.popsci.com/gray-seals-conservation) which were hunted to near extinction before the Marine Mammal Protection Act made it illegal to systematically kill the animals in 1973.
