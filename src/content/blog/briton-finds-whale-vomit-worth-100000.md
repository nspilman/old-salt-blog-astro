There is some very interesting beachcombing going on these days in the UK.  Two weeks ago, we posted about  four large, barrel-shaped pieces of lard that washed up on the beach at St.Cyrus nature reserve in Scotland.  Locals opined that it smelled “*good enough to have a fry up with,”*  which convinced me never to try fried food in that part of Scotland.  Now, Ken Wilman, who was out walking his dog on a beach in Lancashire, found a 6 pound smelly lump of what may be ambergris, the “whale vomit” valued in the manufacturing of perfume.  He has been offered £43,000 for the lump by a French dealer, though others have valued it at between £100,000 – 180,000. Thanks to Irwin Bryan for passing the story along.
