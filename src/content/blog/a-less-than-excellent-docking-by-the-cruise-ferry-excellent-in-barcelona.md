When the [cruise/ferry *Excellent*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellent_\(ferry\)) docked in Barcelona, her arrival was less than, shall we say, excellent. Yesterday, at around 8AM, local time, the 663′ long ship was caught in high winds. While waiting for additional tugs, the ship was blown down on to the dock, striking and toppling a container gantry crane. The gantry crane fell on stacks of containers, causing a fire. Some of the burning containers were reported to contain hazardous materials. Barcelona firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze by around 11AM. No injuries were reported on the ship, the dock or among the firefighters. 

The cruise/ferry *Excellent* has a capacity for 2253 passengers and 760 vehicles and is owned by the Italian firm [Grandi Navi Veloci.](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandi_Navi_Veloci) Thanks to Phil Leon for contributing to this post.
