Last October, [we posted about the *MV Miner*, ex](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2011/10/03/ns-stuck-ship-salvage-plan-scaterie.html) *[Canadian Miner](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2011/10/03/ns-stuck-ship-salvage-plan-scaterie.html),* a Great Lakes bulk carrier whose tow rope snapped on the way to the scrap yard. The ship drifted onto Scatarie Island, off the coast of Cape Breton in Nova Scotia.  Now eight months after the grounding a contract has been given to the Bennington Group, a New York-based salvage company, to dismantle and remove the wreck.
