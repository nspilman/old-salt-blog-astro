Truman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Harry_S._Truman), the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that [collided with the merchant bulk carrier](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2025/02/aircraft-carrier-uss-harry-s-truman-collides-with-bulk-carrier-in-mediterranean-sea-near-suez-canal/) [M/V *Besiktas-M*](https://www.classnk.or.jp/register/regships/one_dsp.aspx?imo=9291365) off the coast of Egypt, put into Souda Bay, Greece, for repairs, [US 6th Fleet announced on Sunday](https://www.c6f.navy.mil/Press-Room/News/Article/4068846/uss-harry-s-truman-conducts-emergent-repair-availability/).

“While the ship is fully mission capable and the ship conducted flight operations following the collision, pulling into port for emergent repairs will enable the ship to continue deployment as scheduled,” said Capt. Dave Snowden, H*arry S. Truman*’s commanding officer.

The Navy’s Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center will assess the repairs needed to the carrier following the collision.

*Truman* collided with the M/V *Besiktas-M* off the coast of Port Said at the entrance to the Suez Canal on Wednesday night.

The starboard bow of *Besiktas-M* hit the starboard quarter of *Truman* as the bulker was exiting the canal bound for Constanta, Romania. The collision damaged a sponson to the rear of *Truman’s* aft starboard aircraft elevator and pierced the hull above the waterline further aft.

The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group (HSTCSG) units remain operational across geographic regions in support of their component commanders,” said Rear Adm. Sean Bailey, commander of HSTCSG. “Our mission has not changed and we remain committed to responding to any challenge in this dynamic and global security environment.”

The carrier strike group includes the flagship USS *Harry S. Truman* (CVN 75); Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 1, with eight embarked aviation squadrons; staffs from CSG-8, CVW-1, and Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 28; the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS *Gettysburg* (CG 64); and three Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers, *USS Stout* (DDG 55), USS *The Sullivans* (DDG 68), and USS *Jason Dunham* (DDG 109).
