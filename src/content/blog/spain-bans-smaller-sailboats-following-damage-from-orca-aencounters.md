![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/09/orcasurge.jpg)Some sailors along Spain’s Galician coast must be saying “we’re gonna need a bigger boat.” There have been reports of up to 30 attacks by orcas directed at sailboats on the northwestern coast of Spain and Portugal.

Now, the [Spanish Coast guard is banning boats under 15 meters](https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-sailing-killerwhales/spanish-coastguard-bans-small-sailboats-after-damage-from-orcas-idUSL5N2GL4FU) (49 feet) long from taking to the sea for at least a week off about 90 km (56 miles) of the coast between Cape Piorino Grande and Point Estacas de Bares. The ban could be extended if the pods remain in the area.

Pods of orcas in the region have been ramming and biting boat hulls and rudders since at least  August 19. So far, no one has been killed or seriously injured although several boats have suffered damage to their steering gear or propellers and have had to be towed to safety.
