After damaging a wingtip that extended beyond the side of the barge when the [Space Shuttle Enterprise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Enterprise) was moved from Kennedy Airport on Sunday, today the shuttle was moved to a larger barge for its last and shorter leg of its voyage to the [Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum](http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/) on the Hudson River in Manhattan.

The latest schedule for the move is for the shuttle to pass the Statue of Liberty around 10:50 a.m. and the World Trade Center at 11: 40 a.m., arriving at the Intrepid Museum at 12:30 p.m.
