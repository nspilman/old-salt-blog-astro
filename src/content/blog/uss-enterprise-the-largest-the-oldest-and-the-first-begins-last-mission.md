![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/USS_Enterprise_CVN-65.jpg)The *[USS Enterprise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_\(CVN-65\))* has set sail on her final mission. The fifty year old carrier is heading to the Middle East on a seven-month deployment.  The “Big E,” as she is called, was the first nuclear powered air craft carrier in the world. She is also the longest US aircraft carrier as well as the oldest, commissioned in 1961.  Where all other US nuclear carriers have two nuclear reactors, the *Enterprise* has eight. She also has four rudders, where most carriers have two.

She has been deployed to conflicts around the world including Vietnam, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Persian Gulf. The Enterprise was one of the first ships to respond after the Sept. 11 attacks.  She was a spotter ship for John Glenn’s historic orbit around the earth and played a starring role in Tom Cruise’s hit movie, “Top Gun.”  
  
On her return to the United States, the *USS Enterprise* is scheduled to be deactivated on December 1, 2012.  Her reactors and nuclear fuel will be removed at Newport News, the shipyard where she was built, in a process which will take until 2015. After her fuel is removed, she will be  scrapped.
