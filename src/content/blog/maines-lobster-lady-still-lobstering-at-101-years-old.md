Lobsterman Max Oliver, 78, captains the lobster boat *Virginia* out of Rockland, Maine, three days a week, May through November. The boat happens to be named after his crew, [Virginia Oliver](https://www.wftv.com/news/trending/maines-lobster-lady-still-going-strong-101/3NRXYWJIABEKNF7ZWF3GIFB6ZA/), who is also his mother.  At age 101, she is believed to be the oldest lobsterer in the world. And she is still going strong. 

Oliver — known by friends as Ginny and to some as the “Lobster Lady” — has lived in Rockland her entire life and still lives on the same street where she was born in 1920. She has been lobstering on Penobscot Bay since she was seven years old. Now, Oliver works 200 pots with her son, Max, hauling them out of the water while she fills the bait bags and bands the lobsters, [WCSH](https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/local/207/101-year-old-maine-woman-may-be-the-oldest-person-in-the-world-still-lobstering/97-f51e49dc-bb67-4f87-a320-53b89ae5720d) reported.
