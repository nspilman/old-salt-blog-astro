Sometime between last Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, vandals broke into the [USS *Ling*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Ling), a World War II-era Balao-class submarine, which has been a museum ship in the Hackensack River since 1973. The vandals stole four bronze plaques, dedicated to the sailors lost in the 52 United States submarines sunk during World War II. The vandals also cut through locks to open hatches on the 312-foot long, 2,500-ton submarine, flooding the inner hull of the vessel. The plaques are valued at $10,000. 

[NorthJersey.com](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/hackensack/2018/08/14/hackensack-submarine-uss-ling-flooded-intentionally-memorial-plaques-stolen/989139002/) quotes Les Altschuler, vice president of the Submarine Memorial Association, which is responsible for maintaining the vessel. “Locks were cut. Somebody had to know what they were doing to flood the submarine. We didn’t have enough rain to flood the boat — somebody opened the hatches.”

The submarine was once the centerpiece of the [New Jersey Naval Museum](http://www.njnm.org/) operated by the Submarine Memorial Association, at 78 River St., Hackensack, New Jersey. Since 1972, the museum had rented the riverfront site for $1 per year. The museum has been looking for a new location since 2007, when the previous owner sold the property for redevelopment. A 600-unit luxury residential community, an outdoor public plaza and a river walk are now intended to be built at the location.

The current owner, Macromedia, evicted the museum from the site, and Tuesday was the deadline for officials to clear their property from a small trailer from the site.

The submarine is not part of the redevelopment project, and its removal is not part of the eviction. While the flooding by vandals no doubt damaged the submarine, it was never in danger of sinking as it has been [mired in the mud for years.](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/hackensack/2016/12/19/historic-submarine-stuck-mud/94766024/)

The submarine is estimated to need around 17 feet of water to be towed out. The channel has silted to roughly 10 feet, so dredging would be necessary to move the sub. The submarine is also upstream of a low drawbridge which has not been operated in decades. It has been estimated that the cost of the moving USS *Ling* could run to millions of dollars. 

USS *Ling* has not been open to the public since 2012 when its gangway was damaged by Hurricane Sandy. The museum shut down in 2015 and a year later the [U.S. Navy took back about 100 artifacts](https://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2016/10/navy_taking_back_its_artifacts_from_evicted_north.html) on loan to the museum to prevent further deterioration.

USS *Ling* was commissioned shortly before the end of World War II and never saw combat. She was decommissioned after less than a year in service. In 1960, she was converted to a submarine training vessel. She was struck from the Navy list in 1971.
