Given the arrival of Hurricane Irene to the East Coast of the US,  it seems worthwhile to take a look back at the [Hurricane of 1938](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_New_England_hurricane), also known as the Long Island Express, the Yankee Clipper and the Great New England Hurricane. It was the first major hurricane to hit New England since 1869.   The hurricane was estimated to have killed between 682 and 800 people, damaged or destroyed over 57,000 homes, and caused property losses estimated at US$306 million ($4.77 billion in 2011). Thanks to Jersey City Frankie for pointing out this documentary about the storm.  By WGBH for PBS.
