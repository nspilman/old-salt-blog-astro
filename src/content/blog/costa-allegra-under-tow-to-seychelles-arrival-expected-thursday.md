A French fishing vessel was the first ship to reach the stricken [*Costa Allegra*, which has been drifting without power](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/02/27/cruise-ship-costa-allegra-adrift-off-seychelles/) in the Indian Ocean, as the result of an engine room fire Monday. The fishing vessel took the cruise ship under tow and has since been joined by two tugs to assist in towing the stricken ship to the Seychelles.  The ship in tow is expected to arrive at the island of Mahé, in the Seychelles, on Thursday.

  
There are 636 passengers and 413 crew members on the *Allegra* – 212 Italian, 31 British and eight US passengers. Four of the passengers are reported to be children aged three or younger.   No one was injured in the fire and blackout. The ship has emergency power but limited lighting and no air conditioning.  An armed nine-member Italian military team is on duty aboard the Allegra to guard against potential pirate attack.
