The last image of HMS *Bounty* was brutal – sinking off Cape Hatteras with broken spars, most of the crew in lifeboats and the captain and one crew member missing. Here are a few photos from another time, way back in 1996, on a repositioning leg between New York and Newport Rhode, Island. The wind was light from the southwest and the sea was calm. All photos by Rick Spilman. Click on the thumbnails for a larger image.
