![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/01/pelican1.jpg)The headline in the Liverpool Daily Post reads, “[Places available on first Liverpool transatlantic tall ship voyage for more than 100 years](http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2012/01/03/places-available-on-first-liverpool-transatlantic-tall-ship-voyage-for-more-than-100-years-92534-30049505/).”   Whether this is literally true or not, the trip looks very interesting for a number of reasons. The three-masted barquentine *[Pelican](http://www.adventureundersail.com/index.html)* will sail from the River Mersey with 28 passengers on a crossing from Liverpool to the West Indies on September 22.  *Pelican* is operated by [Adventure Under Sail Ltd.](http://www.adventureundersail.com/index.html)  
  
The voyage sounds great. What catches my eye, however, is the ship itself, or rather its rig. The *Pelican* is square rigged on the main mast but fore and aft rigged on the fore mast and mizzen.  The rig, designed by Phillip Goode, is intended as a hybrid between a traditional square rig and the mixed square and fore and aft rig of the Barbary coast Xebecs.

The rig and the ship is discussed in the video below:
