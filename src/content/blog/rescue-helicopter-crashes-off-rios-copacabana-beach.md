From time to time, it is worth being reminded just how difficult it is to pilot a helicopter over wind and waves.  Despite signs warning of dangerous conditions, a swimmer got into trouble in the ocean off Rio de Janeiro ‘s popular Copacabana Beach.  A rescue helicopter was dispatched to assist the swimmer in distress, only to crash due to an unspecified mechanical failure, just offshore from where hundreds frolicked in the surf or walked the beach,  One beach-goer captured the crash on video on his cell phone.  Fortunately, the four aboard the helicopter all escaped without serious injury, as did the swimmer in distress who was picked up by a surfer.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing along the news.
