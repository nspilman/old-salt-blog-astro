Just about two years ago, we [posted a time-lapse video](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/timelapse-of-the-building-of-the-lugger-grayhound/) of the building of the [lugger *Greyhound*](http://grayhoundluggersailing.com/).  The video covers a 45 day building period in about ten minutes, starting from the keel, the raising of the frames to the beginning of planking.  Here is a video of the end product — the lugger *Greyhound* under sail in a video shot from aloft by Debbie Purser of [Classic Sailing](http://www.classic-sailing.co.uk/).  A beautiful craft, indeed.
