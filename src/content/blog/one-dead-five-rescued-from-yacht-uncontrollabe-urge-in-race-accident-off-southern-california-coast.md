In a race from Long Beach to San Diego, one sailor died and five were rescued after the sailboat *Uncontrollable Urge* lost steering.  The [Associated Press is reporting](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ibMQwV907diTvQ6XwDsNvGS4f4gw?docId=12f63b4301a3451bae06c1f370c2aaa6) that the crew sent a mayday call during a race but then declining help from the Coast Guard and other boaters as their boat drifted in rough seas.  The crew abandoned ship after the boat was swept onto rocks off San Clemente Island.  When the Coast Guard reached the crew, they found 36-year-old Craig Thomas Williams unresponsive in the water, the San Diego County Medical Examiner’s office said.
