Four workers on a drilling rig 135 miles off the coast of Thailand saw something completely unexpected in the ocean swimming toward the rig — [a small brown dog](https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1661948/s%E0%B8%BAeafaring-dog-boonrod-brought-ashore-in-songkhla).  The dog successfully climbed onto a partially submerged strut on the rig. The workers spent the next quarter hour attempting to bring the shivering canine safely aboard the rig, operated by Chevron. Using ropes to harness the pooch, the four men succeeded in bringing the dog up to the deck, where they wrapped it in blankets and gave it food and water.

The drill rig workers named the new arrival Boonrod (survivor, or saved one). The dog apparently was in remarkably good shape, beyond being cold, tired, hungry and dehydrated. 

How did a dog end up swimming in the ocean 135 miles offshore? It seems unlikely to have swum that far. The [Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1661948/s%E0%B8%BAeafaring-dog-boonrod-brought-ashore-in-songkhla) suggests that it could have fallen from a passing fishing trawler. 

After a couple of days recovering aboard the rig, Boonrod was moved to a dog rescue facility in Thailand’s Songkhla province, where he is said to be doing well. [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/16/asia/dog-found-at-sea-thailand-intl/index.html) reports that [Rig worker Vitisak Payalaw](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/16/asia/dog-found-at-sea-thailand-intl/index.html), an offshore planner with Chevron, has said that once he returns to shore that he would like to adopt Boonrod.
