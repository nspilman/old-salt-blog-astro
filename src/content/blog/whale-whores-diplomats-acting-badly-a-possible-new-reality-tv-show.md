![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/whale_wars1.jpg)We have been critical of the Sea Shepherds and their reality TV show, “[Whale Wars](http://animal.discovery.com/tv/whale-wars/),” which has not only demonstrated dreadful seamanship but has also encouraged illegal and dangerous vigilante violence.   We have suggested that diplomacy is preferable to thuggery.  That being said, diplomacy has its problems as well.   The [Times of London](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7149086.ece) recently reported that lobbyists working for the Japanese are allegedly offering bribes, airline tickets and prostitutes in exchange for a vote for a new quota system to allow limited commercial whaling, which will be voted on at the upcoming meeting of the [International Whaling Commission.](http://iwcoffice.org/) The Japanese deny anything improper.    I see the potential for a new reality TV show here – *Whale Whore$ – Diplomats Acting Badly*.  Money, back-room deals and sex – definate possibilities.
