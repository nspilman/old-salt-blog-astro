I am not entirely sure why I find this funny, but I do. Perhaps it is because it seems like it all should be secret.  Nevertheless, there appears to be an affinity cruise for everyone so why not a [“SpyCruise](http://spycruise.com/spycruise.html)?”  I wonder if a cloak and dagger is required in the dining room?

[SpyCruise® A National Security Educational Lecture/Seminar Series](http://spycruise.com/spycruise.html)  
*SpyCruise® is a private group aboard a cruise ship where members attend exclusive lectures and talks on espionage, spies, intelligence, counterterrorism and more. Speakers are intelligence experts, leaders, officers, operatives, analysts, authors and historians, many of whom served in the US Intelligence Community. Each cruise we choose a different ship, a different destination and a different agenda.*

*SpyCruise® is a unique opportunity for anyone interested in the topic of intelligence to meet and learn from real experts in the intelligence field as well as others who share the same interest in this topic and history, world affairs, intelligence, military, books, etc. Lectures are normally once a day and the rest of the time is yours to enjoy the cruise ship and its excursions at different destinations.*

*Cruise to the Caribbean aboard the Holland American MS Eurodam from November 13 to 20, 2010. Presented by the [Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies (CI CENTRE)](http://cicentre.com/) and [Henley-Putnam University](http://www.henley-putnam.edu/).*
