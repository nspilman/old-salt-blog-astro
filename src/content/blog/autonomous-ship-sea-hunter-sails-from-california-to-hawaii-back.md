![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/02/seahuntertop.jpg)Two years ago we [posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/04/us-navy-tests-anti-submarine-drone-ship/) about the [ASW Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTUV) *Sea Hunter,* a 132′ long autonomous drone trimaran designed to track enemy submarines, being developed by the US Navy. The unmanned ship reached a major milestone recently after [sailing autonomously](https://www.navalnews.com/news/2019/02/sea-hunter-usv-reaches-new-autonomy-milestone/) from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and back.

While *Sea Hunter* may have sailed autonomously to Hawaii and back, it was not unattended. Crew members from an escort vessel boarded the ship for short durations to check electrical and propulsion systems. For most of the voyage, however, the [ship was unmanned](https://www.military.com/defensetech/2019/02/15/navy-ship-sailed-hawaii-and-back-no-one-board.html). 

As we noted in our previous post, the US Navy is facing the challenge of countering the potential threat from a new generation of diesel-electric submarines.  The idea was to counter this threat by using a fleet of unmanned drone ships to detect and continuously track diesel-electric submarines.  Since our first post, however, the *Sea Hunter’*s designation has been changed to Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessel (MDUSV). It appears that the mission of the ship has been made considerably broader than strictly Anti-Submarine Warfare.

One question remains. When there are scores of over 130′ long autonomous ships deployed on the oceans, who has the right of way? The Navy has a hard enough time avoiding collisions with dozens of people on the bridge of their ships.  How will they manage an autonomous fleet?
