[Ghost ship haunts tsunami-hit Japanese city](http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/03/22/idINIndia-55780220110322)

*The newest landmark in the tsunami-stricken city of Kesennuma is a massive fishing trawler that was swept up at sea and came to rest on one of the main roads to City Hall. The No. 18 Kyotoku-maru ship, with a red and blue hull and a “safety first” slogan painted just above its bridge, looms over a landscape of homes and business splintered by the March 11 tsunami and then set ablaze in an ensuing fire.*  
  
*“It really catches the eye,” said Ayaka Hatakeyama, who used to run a butcher shop a few metres from where the ship came to rest in the centre of this northeastern port city.*

*The ship stands out in an already surreal landscape of convenience stores smashed by houses and cars perched precariously on crumbling concrete walls.*

*Locals share stories about the ship whose crew was forced to stay on board as the city beneath them blazed through the night.*

*“We heard the ship was full of fuel and worried that it was going to explode,” Hatakeyama said as she took a break from salvaging goods from her store.*

*The central business district of the city of 73,000 was ravaged by the tsunami that filled streets with water two-floors high and parked smaller ships haphazardly in other locations.*

*But the Kyotoku-maru will likely stay where it now sits as a ghost ship for some time to come, with officials expecting it to take months just to remove the debris caused by the tsunami.*

*“I have no idea how they are going to get that thing out of here,” one fire-fighter said.*
