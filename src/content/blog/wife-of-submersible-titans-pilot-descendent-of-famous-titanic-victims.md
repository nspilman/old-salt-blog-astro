![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/06/strauss.jpg)Wendy Rush, the wife of the late Stockton Rush, the co-founder of OceanGate and pilot of the *Titan* when the submersible imploded, is a [great-great-granddaughter of two first-class passengers](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/21/us/wendy-stockton-rush-titanic-missing-submersible.html) who died when the *Titanic* sank in 1912.

Ms. Rush is a great-great-granddaughter of the retailing magnate [Isidor Straus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidor_Straus) and his wife, Ida, two of the wealthiest people aboard the *Titanic* for its first voyage. Mr. Straus, born in 1845, was a co-owner of Macy’s department store.

Ms. Rush, born Wendy Hollings Weil, married Stockton Rush in 1986, according to a New York Times [wedding announcement](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/06/style/wendy-weil-is-the-bride-of-engineer.html). Her LinkedIn page says that she has participated in three OceanGate expeditions to the Titanic wreckage in the last two years; that she serves as the company’s communications director; and that she is a longtime board member of the company’s charitable foundation.

Ms. Rush’s ancestors on the *Titanic* are perhaps best remembered for their tragic love story. Survivors of the disaster recalled seeing Isidor Straus refuse a seat on a lifeboat when women and children were still waiting to flee the sinking liner. Ida Straus, his wife of four decades, declared that she would not leave her husband, and the two were seen standing arm in arm on the Titanic’s deck as the ship went down.

Ms. Rush is descended from one of the Strauses’ daughters, Minnie, who married Dr. Richard Weil in 1905. Their son, Richard Weil Jr., later served as president of Macy’s New York, and his son, Dr. Richard Weil III, is Ms. Rush’s father, according to Joan Adler, the executive director of the Straus Historical Society.

Isidor Straus’s body was found at sea roughly two weeks after the *Titanic* sank, [New York Times archives](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/05/13/104896604.html?pageNumber=3) show. Ida Straus’s remains have never been recovered.
