Unfortunately, whale sharks, which are no more whales than the converted OBO, may be proving more effective at oil skimming.  Recently more than more than 100 feeding whale sharks were spotted within 60 miles of the Deepwater Horizon blow-out.  Whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea,  are filter feeders, scooping up plankton and small fish with their mouths as they swim just beneath the surface. Scientists are concerned they will swallow large amounts of toxic oil and die.
