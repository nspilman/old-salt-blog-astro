[U.S. Navy Captain Mark Kelly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_E._Kelly), Congresswoman Gabby Giffords’ husband,  has been by her side since she was tragically shot in Tucson earlier this month.  We [posted previously](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/10/tragedy-from-kings-point-to-tucson/) about how Captain Kelly, who is a NASA astronaut,  went to the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, NY.

Captain Mark Kelly has a twin brother, Scott, who is also an astronaut and who also went to a merchant marine academy, the State University of New York Maritime College at Fort Schuyler, only a few miles across the water from Kings Point.  The Kelly brothers are the only twins and the only siblings who have both traveled in space.  [Captain Scott Kelly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_J._Kelly) is currently in space as the commander of the International Space Station.  Both brothers each have two children from earlier marriages.  Scott is currently divorced. Mark married Congress woman Giffords on November 10, 2007.
