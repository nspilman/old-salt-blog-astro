![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Alt_Jeffrey-Allisoncircumna.jpg)Jeffrey Allison is a fascinating gentlemen. Now 73, from  Middleton Tyas in the UK, he only started sailing when he retired from a career in engineering. Since then, he has sailed across the Atlantic six times, as well transiting the Panama Canal, and sailing the Pacific, Indian and Arctic Oceans. He has just returned from a 40 day circumnavigation of the Arctic. Allison and his crew, Australian crewmate Katherine Brownlie, 28, are the first to circumnavigate the Arctic in a clockwise direction. Two yachts previously circumnavigated the Arctic counter-clockwise in 2010.

Allison made a previous attempt to circumnavigate the Arctic in 2009 but was arrested by the Russian coastguard for allegedly crossing into Russian territorial waters.
