On a fog-shrouded Tuesday, the schooner [*Unicorn*](http://www.tallshipunicorn.com/) was the first to arrive in Halifax for their [Tall Ships Festival](http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/NovaScotiaBeaches/tallships2012.aspx). In addition to being a lovely topsail schooner, the *Unicorn* is the only tall ship sailing in the world with an entirely female crew. The schooner is host to the “[Sisters Under Sail Program](http://www.sistersundersail.org/).” Founded by Dawn Santamaria, the program introduces young women to tall ship sailing, directed by a professional all-female crew.  Last year, [Dawn Santamaria was honored with the 2011 Leadership In Women’s Sailing Award](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/08/sisters-under-sail-founder-dawn-santamaria-awarded-leadership-in-women%E2%80%99s-sailing-award/) at the National Women’s Sailing Association Conference, in Marblehead, MA for the Sisters Under Sail program.  Thanks to [Linda Collison](http://www.lindacollison.com/) for passing along the news.
