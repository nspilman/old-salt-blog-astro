There may only be 21 days left until Spring, yet Winter has not yet relinquished her grip.  On the island of Nantucket, photographer [Jonathan Nimerfroh](http://www.jdnphotography.com/) captured [photos of slow moving waves of slush](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/28/science/nantucket-frozen-waves.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=photo-spot-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0) breaking on the beach. “I just noticed a really bizarre horizon,” said Mr. Nimerfroh, who is also a surfer. “The snow was up to my knees, getting to the water. I saw these crazy half-frozen waves. Usually on a summer day you can hear the waves crashing, but it was absolutely silent. It was like I had earplugs in my ears.” The motion of the waves has not allowed frozen ice crystals to form into a solid sheet of ice, so the ocean waters off Nantucket have become the consistency of a 7-Eleven [Slurpee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurpee).

Meanwhile, on the Great Lakes, ice caves have been forming. Ice caves usually form around once a decade, yet this is the second year in a row that they have made an appearance on the shores of Lake Michigan.
