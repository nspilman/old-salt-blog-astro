Now that Thanksgiving is behind us, it is time to start decorating for Christmas with lights, trees, and wreathes. At the Mystic Seaport Museum, [170 wreaths are being constructed or decorated over a period of 18 days](https://www.mysticseaport.org/news/2017/decking-the-halls/) to provide decorations for the festivities.

Up and down the north-east coast of the United States and Canada distinctive lobster pot Christmas trees are being assembled and decorated to welcome in the season. In [Barrington, Nova Scotia, a lobster pot Christmas tree](http://www.thecoastguard.ca/living/tree-lighting-held-for-municipality-of-barringtons-lobster-pot-tree-164650/) built of over 200 recycled lobster pots was lit on Thursday accompanied by fireworks. 

In Rockland, Maine, a 150 lobster port Christmas tree went up about a week ago in preparation for this weekend’s [Rockland Festival of Lights](https://www.facebook.com/events/1450596125035440/). The tree features 2,500 lights, and more than 100 lobster buoys.
