![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/10/bristolshanty.jpg)On Sunday, October 10, from noon to 6PM, Bristol, England will host its first sea shanty festival with ten shanty crews performing on outdoor stages on the city’s harborside.

[Classicalmusic.com](https://www.classical-music.com/news/bristol-to-host-its-first-sea-shanty-festival/) reports that crews will perform in Brunel Square beside the iconic [SS *Great Britain*](https://www.ssgreatbritain.org/); on [The *Matthew*](https://matthew.co.uk/), a modern reconstruction of the original *Matthew* that sailed to Newfoundland in 1497; in Underfall Yard, a historic boatyard on Spike Island; and within the grounds of the SS *Great Britain* itself.

The festival has been organized in conjunction with the [Docks Heritage Weekend](https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/m-shed/whats-on/docks-heritage-weekend/) as the brainchild of shanty group High & Dry. It comes after Bristol-based shanty group [The Longest Johns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Longest_Johns) were signed to Decca Records after the viral TikTok sea shanty trend and the success of their performances of shanties aboard the SS *Great Britain*.
