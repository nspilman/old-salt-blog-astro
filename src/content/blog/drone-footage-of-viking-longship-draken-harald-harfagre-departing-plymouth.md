We have been posting about the ongoing East Coast tour by the Viking longship [*Draken Harald Hårfagre*](https://www.drakenhh.com/). Here is a lovely drone video by Ryan Smith of the longship as she departs Plymouth, MA bound for Rockland, ME.

The 115 foot long *Draken Harald Hårfagre* is the largest Viking longship built in modern times.  In late April 2016, Draken Harald Hårfagre set out from her home port in Haugesund, Norway on an epic voyage across the Atlantic to America. She visited ports on the US and Canadian East coasts as well as in the Great Lakes before wintering in [Mystic Seaport](https://www.mysticseaport.org/). She was on display at Mystic in the summer of 2017. 

Following her port call in Rockland, the longship will sail for Portland, ME.  [Additional port calls will be announced](https://www.drakenhh.com/east-coast-tour-2018/). *Draken Harald Hårfagre* will be returning to Mystic Seaport in October.
