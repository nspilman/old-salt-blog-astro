![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/patriotcrash.jpg)At about 6 PM on Sunday, the [American Magic yacht *Patriot*](https://americanmagic.americascup.com/en/ac75) was rounding the final mark in Race 3 of Round Robin 2, of the Prada Cup in Aukland, NZ, when [disaster struck](https://americanmagic.americascup.com/en/news/82_AMERICAN-MAGIC-S-AC75-SURVIVES-CRASH-DAMAGE-AND-NEAR-SINKING-ON-THE-HAURAKI-GULF.html). The wind increased from 12 knots to 23 knots in just 40 seconds. The boat accelerated to 47 knots, was briefly airborne, and then crashed and capsized, doing serious damage to the hull, and coming close to sinking. Fortunately, none of the crew was injured.

With the concerted efforts of boats from the local harbor patrol, Coast Guard, and each of the three other race competitors, the flooding was brought under control. At one point there were said to be sixteen pumps in use to bring the water level under control.  The flooding was from a hole caused by a section of the carbon fiber hull shearing on impact in the sudden crash stop from almost 50 knots. *Patriot* was towed back to the dock at 10:45 PM NZDT.

Now a race has begun to repair and rebuilt the *Patriot* in time to compete in the next round of races. The *American Magic* team only has 11 days. In a [news conference this morning](https://youtu.be/4-yvEmEqdBc), Terry Hutchinson, the team Skipper & Executive Director, estimated that repairs will take between 8 – 10 days, leaving very little margin for preparations for the next races.

Fortunately, the team has a full backup of components. Nevertheless,  Hutchinson suggested that he was most worried about electronics and software issues.
