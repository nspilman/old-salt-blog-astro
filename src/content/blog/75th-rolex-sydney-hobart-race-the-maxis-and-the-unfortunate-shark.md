![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/skallywag.jpg)The five 100′ long maxi yachts dominated the 75th sailing of the [Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race](https://www.rolexsydneyhobart.com/), each finishing the 630 nautical mile race within the same two-hour window. [Commanche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche_\(yacht\)) took line honors finishing the race in 1 day, 18 hours, 30 minutes and 24 seconds.  She was followed closely by [*InfoTrack*](https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/the-superyacht-directory/infotrack--96499), [*Wild Oats XI*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Oats_XI), [*SHK Scallywag 100*](https://www.rolexsydneyhobart.com/the-yachts/2019/shk-scallywag-100/), and *[Black Jack,](http://blackjackyachting.com/)* respectively.

The standings in the race may have been altered by an unfortunate collision by *Scallywag* and a shark.

[Sail-World](https://www.sail-world.com/news/225290/Sydney-Hobart-%E2%80%93-Sharks-and-Tales) quotes Jack Macartney from *SHK Scallywag*, who had the lead for so much of the race said, “We sailed a nice race, and are happy with what we achieved. Last night we hit a shark whilst doing 25 knots, and then broached as it slammed into the leeward rudder. We had to furl up, and then back down hard, as it was folded around the rudder. Thankfully there was no damage to the boat. We did lose 2-4nm out of the exercise…” 

*Scallywag* crossed the finish line in fourth on Saturday morning, a mere 38 seconds behind nine-time winner *Wild Oats XI* and an hour from *InfoTrack* in second.
