They are expected to cross the finish line in Les Sables d’Olonne, France sometime tomorrow.

The rest of the fleet of 18 boats still in the race is spread out. [Jérémie Beyou](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/53/jeremie-beyou) sailing *Maitre Coq* in third place is about 1,000 nautical miles to the finish line while the last boat competing in 18th place, [Sébastien Destremau](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/62/sebastien-destremau) on *TechnoFirst – faceOcean*  is 9,630 nautical miles from the finish.
