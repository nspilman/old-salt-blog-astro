For anyone around New York harbor this afternoon and evening, Captains Rick and Karen Miles will be presenting a  slide show of  their “Arctic Adventures Aboard the *Wanderbird*” at 4pm and  7pm  in the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, Pier 12, Red Hook, Brooklyn. The slideshow covers their cruise this summer of 6,000 miles from Maine to Greenland to Lat 72N.

[*Wanderbird*](http://www.wanderbirdcruises.com/index.html) is a 90′ converted North Sea trawler, now refitted as an expedition cruise vessel accommodating 12 passengers.  The [cruises](http://www.wanderbirdcruises.com/destinations-alaska.html) and the [accommodations](http://www.wanderbirdcruises.com/ourvessel.html) look wonderful. *[Wanderbird](http://www.wanderbirdcruises.com/index.html)* is on her south for the season to the island of [Culebra](http://www.wanderbirdcruises.com/schedule-2010-winter.html), where she will be offering week long cruises.  Will over at the [Tugster](http://tugster.wordpress.com/) blog has some great shots of *[Wanderbird](http://tugster.wordpress.com/?s=wanderbird)* in New York harbor, [here](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/wanderbird-2/) and [here](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/wanderbird/).

Thanks to the good folks at [PortSide New York](http://portsidenewyork.org/) for the heads up about the slide show.
