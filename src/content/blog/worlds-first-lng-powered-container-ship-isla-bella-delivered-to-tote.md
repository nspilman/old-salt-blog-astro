[NASSCO Shipyard](http://www.nassco.com/) in San Diego delivered *Isla Bella,* the world’s first LNG-powered container ship to TOTE Maritime. The 3100 TEU 764-foot long ship, the first of two 764-foot long Marlin Class container ships, should dramatically decrease emissions and increase fuel efficiency when compared to conventionally-powered ships, the equivalent of removing 15,700 automobiles from the road. The ship was delivered nearly two months ahead of schedule.

“Successfully building and delivering the world’s first LNG-powered container ship here in the United States for coastwise service demonstrates that commercial shipbuilders, and owners and operators, are leading the world in the introduction of cutting-edge, green technology in support of the Jones Act,” Kevin Graney, vice president and general manager of General Dynamics NASSCO, said in a [press release](http://www.generaldynamics.com/news/press-releases/2015/10/general-dynamics-nassco-delivers-world%E2%80%99s-first-lng-powered-containership).  The Jones Act requires that all domestic shipping — shipping from one American port to another — be carried out by American-made and operated ships.

*Isla Bella* will be the newest Jones Act vessel in service. Tragically, TOTE Maritime’s *El Faro*, which was one of the oldest operating Jones Act ships, sank in Hurricane Joaquin, with the loss of 33 crew, on October 1.
