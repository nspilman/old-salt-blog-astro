The [USS ![uss-constitution1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/uss-constitution1.jpg)*Constitution*](http://www.history.navy.mil/ussconstitution/index.html) is the oldest commissioned naval warship afloat. The wooden three masted “super-frigate” in launched in 1797, is due for a three year overhaul and dry-docking starting in early 2015.  Before the historic ship enters the shipyard, she will leave the dock for five short cruises in Boston harbor this summer. The first cruise, or as the Navy puts it, an “underway demonstration” is tomorrow, June 6, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of [D-Day](http://www.army.mil/d-day/) and the 72nd anniversary of the [Battle of Midway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway).

The [*Constitution* will get underway](https://www.facebook.com/notes/uss-constitution/uss-constitution-to-conduct-first-underway-demonstration-of-2014-june-6/10152437795970269) at 9:30 a.m. At approximately 11 a.m., there will be a 21-gun salute off Fort Independence on Castle Island in South Boston in commemoration of the Battle of Midway and D-Day. At approximately noon, *Constitution* sailors will also conduct an additional 17-gun salute near U.S. Coast Guard Base Boston prior to the ship’s 1:30 p.m. return to its pier at Charleston Navy Yard.

*Constitution*‘s remaining 2014 harbor excursions are scheduled for July 4, Aug. 22, Aug. 29 and Oct. 17.  They will be final times the ship gets underway prior to the completion of her refit in 2018.
