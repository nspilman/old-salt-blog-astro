![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/gracebailey.jpg)The schooner [*Grace Bailey*](https://www.sailgracebailey.com/), built in 1882, was returning from a four-day Fall Foliage cruise on Monday morning, when an upper section of the main mast broke and fell to the deck, killing one passenger and injuring three others.  [Thirty-three people were on board](https://apnews.com/article/schooner-broken-mast-death-maine-grace-bailey-f98c93a0d1d05d54c7200920d9a1f40a) the schooner, which was about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) east of Rockland harbor, Maine, the Coast Guard said.

Dr. Emily Mecklenburg, 40, of Rockland, was declared dead when she was brought ashore by a Coast Guard boat following the accident. The Maine Medical Examiner’s Office in Augusta said a cause of death has not yet been determined.

The [Portland Press Herald](https://www.pressherald.com/2023/10/09/one-killed-3-injured-in-accident-aboard-the-schooner-grace-bailey/) reports that Mecklenburg specialized in internal medicine, according to MaineHealth’s website. She had been practicing at Pen Bay Medical Center in Rockport since 2016 and Waldo County General Hospital since 2018.

The three people injured were transported to hospitals Monday, the Rockland Fire Department said. A helicopter transported one of the injured, while the other two were transported to a local hospital, fire officials said.

The 118′ long schooner was built in Patchogue, Long Island, New York, in 1882 by Oliver Perry Smith, and named for owner Edwin Bailey’s daughter, Grace.
