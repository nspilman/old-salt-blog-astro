![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/05/flyer-small.jpg)On Wednesday, Philadelphia’s tall ship, the 112+ year old [barquentine *Gazela*](http://www.gazela.org/), will be among the seventeen tall ships in the “Parade of Sail” on the Hudson River. Once again, however, the *Gazela* will bringing more than just history and grace to the harbor when she ties up alongside Pier 25. She will also bring the full troupe of “[Seven Deadly Seas](http://thesevendeadlyseas.com/)” performing “*[Dead upon a Wind, a Pirate Burlesque](http://thesevendeadlyseas.com/).”*  They will perform on the ship at Pier 25 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, May 25, 26 and 27 at 8 and 10 PM each evening.   [Click here to learn more and/or buy tickets.](http://thesevendeadlyseas.com/)  
  
*[Dead upon a Wind,](http://thesevendeadlyseas.com/) a Pirate Burlesque, continues the exploits of Calico Jack, Anne Bonny, and Mary Read; historical pirates let loose upon a modern world, who find today’s corporate world very familiar. In this show the pirates face a new and familiar enemy, as infighting over the naming rights to a new island (now that all those troublesome residents are no longer a concern) threatens to turn ugly. The situation is not improved when a traveling slave salesman (he also offers insurance) shows up and throws a few more colorful characters in the mix. Shows will be performed in-the-round aboard the Gazela, the oldest wooden square-rigger still sailing in America.*

Last year, the Gazela was the stage for Pirate Burlesque in Red Hook alongside the Mary Whalen at Portside. See our post – “[The Gazela at Portside with Vaudeville and Pirates – Oh My!](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/16/the-gazela-at-portside-with-vaudeville-and-pirates-%E2%80%93-oh-my/)”    Also take a peak at [Will’s review and photos on the tugster blog.](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2010/08/21/gazela-in-atlantic-basin-2/)
