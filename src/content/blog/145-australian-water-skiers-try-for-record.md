I am not entirely sure why anyone would decide to go water skiing with 150 of your closest friends. Then again, why not? Last Friday, one hundred and forty five water-skiers in Australia’s Tasmania skied for a nautical mile inside Macquarie Harbour at Strahan in an attempt to break the world record for the number of skiers pulled behind one boat.  One hundred and fifty four skiers began the attempt, but nine fell. The same group previously set the record in the same location with one hundred and fourteen skiers.
