[2010 Summer Voyaging](http://www.sorenlarsen.co.nz/Pacific.htm)

*In May the ship will depart from New Zealand for the South Seas with a voyage route chosen to encompass some of our favourite island destinations, including the whale breeding grounds of Tonga, the southern and western isles of Fiji, our beloved Vanuatu, including the northern Torres isles which we’re visiting for the first time, and volcanic Tanna (as seen on the Brit TV’s brilliant ‘Meet the Natives’). The Pacifique chic of New Cal is followed by our unfulfilled passage to Australia via Lord Howe, a long awaited return to Sydney harbour and a trans Tasman passage home to NZ.*  
  
*It is a shorter and more conservative schedule than previous years but each trip will be spectacular. The ocean passage from NZ will sail north along the line of the Kermadec ocean trench, calling with supplies at the Dept of Conservation outpost on Raoul island on the way to Tonga. Enough time is allowed on this trip to also cruise the tropical atolls of Tonga and allow us flexibility on choosing a good weather window out of NZ. The ship’s senior Master Jim Cottier returns to take the ship into the Pacific and past permanent crew and voyage have already signed on. It’ll be a good one.*
