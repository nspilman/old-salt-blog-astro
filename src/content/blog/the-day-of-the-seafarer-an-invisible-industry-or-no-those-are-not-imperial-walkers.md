No, they are not Imperial Walkers

Today, June 25th, is the [IMO sponsored International Day of the Seafarer](http://www.imo.org/About/Events/dayoftheseafarer/Pages/Day-of-the-Seafarer-2014.aspx).  This celebration is intended to increase the awareness of the indispensable services rendered to all of us by the 1.5 million seafarers who deliver more than 12 billion tonnes of goods yearly, comprising 90% of all world trade.  Without seafarers, the world as we know it simply could not exist.  The problem is that shipping is literally an offshore industry. Unless, something bad happens, ships, and the seafarers who sail them, are largely invisible to the general public.

I was reminded of this recently after a photo first posted to [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/u61jv/taken_at_boston_logan_airport_please_tell_me_its/) reappeared on Facebook. The photo posted above, was captioned, “*Taken at Boston Logan airport. Please tell me it’s not just me.*” It was clear from the comments that many, if not most, had no idea that the objects they were seeing were container cranes, and not Imperial Walkers.  (I doubt anyone really thought that they were war machines from Star Wars and yet, it was clear that many had no idea what they were.  One might have thought that the proximity to the container ship might have been a clue.)  By the way, the [longtime rumor](http://gcaptain.com/star-wars-imperial-walkers-modeled/) that the AT-ATs, the Imperial Walkers from Star Wars, were modeled after container cranes, turns out to be simply an [urban myth](http://www.slashfilm.com/did-oaklands-cranes-inspire-the-at-at-walkers-the-answer-finally-revealed/).

It speaks volumes that so many do not recognize a container crane. On the other hand, why should they? Where once ports were located in the center of cities,  container ships, tankers and dry bulkers now call at isolated terminals, out of sight and out of mind.  It is easy to be become disconnected from the ships and sailors who bring us everything that we need, and so often take for granted — from oil, grain and ore to the overwhelming majority of manufactured goods, including the computers we use to read blogs on the internet.

So on this [International Day of the Seafarer](http://www.imo.org/About/Events/dayoftheseafarer/Pages/Day-of-the-Seafarer-2014.aspx), it is a good time to recall that ships do not cross the oceans by themselves and to be reminded of the men and women who sail them every day and night in all conditions and hazards.  Thank you, seafarers.
