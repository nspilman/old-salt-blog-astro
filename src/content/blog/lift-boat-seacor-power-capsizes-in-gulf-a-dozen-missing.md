![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/seacorpowercapsize.jpg)The lift boat [*SEACOR Power*](https://seacormarine.com/vessel/265-class-seacor-power/) capsized in the Gulf of Mexico in high winds. The 129′ vessel, used in oil and gas exploration, [capsized eight miles from Port Fourchon, Louisiana](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCG/bulletins/2ccc033), on Tuesday afternoon. [Eighteen were reported to be aboard](https://www.stripes.com/news/us/coast-guard-search-12-missing-in-ship-capsize-off-louisiana-1.669629) the vessel when she capsized. So far six have been rescued and a dozen are missing.

“There was a [microburst of weather that came through the area](https://www.snopes.com/ap/2021/04/14/coast-guard-6-rescued-from-capsized-ship-off-louisiana/) at the time of the incident,” Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Jonathan Lally said. “I don’t know whether that was the cause, but we can say is that inclement weather did hit the area at the time.” A search by air and sea was ongoing Wednesday, he said.

The crew of the Coast Guard Cutter [*Glenn Harris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Glenn_Harris), a 154-foot Fast Response Cutter, arrived on the scene within 30 minutes and rescued one person from the vessel. A response boat from Coast Guard Cutter *Grand Isle* rescued another person, and good Samaritan vessels on the scene have rescued four others from the water, the [Coast Guard reports](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCG/bulletins/2ccc033).
