The car/passenger ferry [*Francisco*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSC_Francisco), built in 2013 by Tasmanian shipyard [Incat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incat), is billed as the fastest ship in the world. The 99 meter ferry has clocked speeds of 58 knots (67 mph; 107 km/h). Operated by [Buquebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buquebus), an Argentine-Uruguayan ferry company, *Francisco* is capable of accommodating 1024 passengers and 150 cars. The ferry is an Incat wave piercing catamaran design, built of aluminium, and the powered by the two 22MW GE LM2500 gas turbines driving Wartsila LJX 1720 SR waterjets. The ferry is also notable in that it can run on either marine distillate fuel or liquefied natural gas (LNG.) *Francisco* operates on the River Plate between Buenos Aires and Montevideo.
