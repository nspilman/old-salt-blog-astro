Thanks to Alaric Bond for passing on this intriguing video of a group of German reenactors on the *Willow Wren.* The note with the video reads, (imperfectly translated by Google,) “*Maritimes reenactment in 1807 of the Danish South Sea aboard the “Willow Wren.” A strange group of unknown Danish mission in the South Seas on the road*.”  So far I have been unable to find any information on the reenactors of the *Willow Wren*. If anyone knows more about them I would love to learn more.
