An update on the *MV Faina* – still being held hostage by Somali pirates.

[Somali pirates hold whip hand in standoff](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/26/MN6913NSJK.DTL)

And a comment by my 12 year old son, Ted. He suggested that he would like to learn some Somali so that next year when “Talk Like a Pirate Day” rolls around, he will really be able to talk like a pirate.
