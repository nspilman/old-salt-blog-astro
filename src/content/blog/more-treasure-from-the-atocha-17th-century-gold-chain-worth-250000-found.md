In 1622 the a fleet of twenty-eight ships left Havana bound for Spain loaded with the treasure of an empire. Among them was the *Nuestra Señora de Atocha*, which carried 24 tons of silver bullion in 1038 ingots, 180,00 pesos of silver coins, 582 copper ingots, 125 gold bars and discs, 350 chests of indigo, 525 bales of tobacco, 20 bronze cannon and 1,200 pounds of worked silverware.   The *Atocha* was lost in a hurricane. A second hurricane scattered her wreckage.

In July of 1985, after a sixteen year search Mel Fischer located at least part of the wreckage and recovered artifacts, gold, silver and emeralds valued at more than $450million.   Still missing, however, is the sterncastle, where it is believed that most of the gold and rare Muzo emeralds would have been stored for safekeeping in the captain’s cabin.  Fischer’s divers have been searching for the remaining treasure of the *Atocha* for more than 25 years.   The gold chain may be a tantalizing taste of treasure yet unfound.
