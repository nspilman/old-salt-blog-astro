USS Texas (BB-35)

I remember visiting the battleship [USS *Texas*](http://battleshiptexas.org/battleship-texas/) in the San Jacinto River in Texas as schoolboy from Dallas while on a family vacation, almost fifty years ago.  Her 14″ guns were impressive and I still recall climbing around her anti-aircraft guns on deck.  This week marked the 100th anniversary of the USS *Texas*‘ commissioning on March 12, 1914.

USS *Texas* is a [*New York*\-class battleship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York-class_battleship) and the last of the [dreadnoughts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreadnought). She fought in both World War I and World War II, providing artillery support in both the invasion of Normandy and the assaults on Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  She has been a museum ship since 1947.

In recent years her greatest battles have been with rust and inadequate funding.  We posted in 2012 about chronic leaks in the hull that have threatened to sink the ship.  (See [Update: 100 Year Old Battleship Texas Shutdown Indefinitely by Leaks](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/update-100-year-old-battleship-texas-shutdown-indefinitely-by-leaks/)).  Plans to put the ship in a “dry berth” to preserve her have been [put on hold due to lack of funding](http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Dry-berth-for-USS-Texas-off-the-table-for-now-3720074.php).  Last year $17.5 million in funding was arranged to allow for critical repairs, while an estimated additional $18 million is still needed. To the question as to whether the glass was half full or half empty, [ship manager, Andy Smith replied, “”At least, we’ve got a glass.”](http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/USS-Texas-repairs-underway-but-that-won-t-be-4549044.php)
