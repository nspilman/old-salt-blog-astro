[![seabubble](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/11/seabubble.jpg)Alain Thébault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Th%C3%A9bault) is known as designer and skipper of the record breaking ocean-going hydrofoil *[Hydroptère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropt%C3%A8re),* which in 2009, was the first sailing boat to sail faster than 50 knots over a measured mile.  Now, Thébault is working on a very different project. Along with Swedish windsurfer Anders Bringdal, Thébault has developed [SeaBubbles](http://www.seabubbles.fr/), electric water taxis that sail on hydrofoils, intended to cut both congestion and pollution in urban centers near water. The SeaBubble is a five person (four passengers plus a driver) battery-powered water taxi designed to fly on foils roughly two feet above the water. A prototype SeaBubble is expected to undergo trials in the spring on the River Seine in Paris. The SeaBubbles are reported to lift onto their foils at around 6-8 knots. Various media reports have quoted a range of top speeds from [11 knots](https://www.thelocal.fr/20161027/paris-flying-river-taxis-to-be-tested-on-seine-sea-bubbles) to [25 knots](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-29/seabubbles-flying-river-taxi-along-the-seine-in-paris-raises-500-000-euros).

If the prototype is successful, Thébault would like to introduce SeaBubbles to London, Geneva and New York.
