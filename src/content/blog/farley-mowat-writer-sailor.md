![mowat](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mowat.jpg)I was saddened to hear of [Farley Mowat’s death, at the age of 92](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/world/americas/farley-mowat-canadian-writer-and-wildlife-advocate-dies-at-92.html?_r=0).  Many will remember him as an environmentalist and a champion of the rights of native Canadians, as indeed he was.  I will remember him for his books about sailing and the sea. He wrote 45 books, most of which were not about the sea. He may be best known for *[Never Cry Wolf](http://www.amazon.com/Never-Cry-Wolf-Amazing-Arctic/dp/0316881791/ref=la_B000AP93DK_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1399559287&sr=1-2),* which was also made into a movie.  

Nevertheless, his books *[Grey Seas Under](http://www.amazon.com/Grey-Seas-Under-Perilous-N/dp/1585742406/ref=la_B000AP93DK_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1399559287&sr=1-5)*  and [*The Serpent’s Coil*](http://www.amazon.com/Serpents-Coil-Farley-Mowat/dp/1585742872/ref=la_B000AP93DK_1_26?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1399559511&sr=1-26) are classic accounts of the little understood business of deep-sea salvage.  Mowat’s very funny book about his misnamed schooner, *Happy Adventure*, in the [*The Boat Who Wouldn’t Float*](http://www.amazon.com/Boat-Who-Wouldnt-Float/dp/055327788X/ref=la_B000AP93DK_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1399559287&sr=1-4) should be required reading for any boat owner.  Whatever his subject, Mowat was a master storyteller. He will be long remembered.
