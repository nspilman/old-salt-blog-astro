![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/goldenarches.jpg)In September 2019, the car carrier [*Golden Ray*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Golden_Ray) lost stability and partially capsized as it departed the Port of Brunswick, GA, carrying about 4,200 vehicles. In October 2019, the *Golden Ray* was declared a total loss, and it was announced that the ship would be cut up in place and scrapped.

But how does one scrap a 660′ long car carrier with a 116′ beam, still loaded with over 4,000 vehicles? To scrap the *Golden Ray* calls for the “Golden Arches,” Versabar’s [VB-10,000 heavy lift catamaran](https://www.vbar.com/vb10000/index.html). The VB-10,000 is the largest heavy-lift vessel ever built in the United States, featuring two truss space frames spanning two barges.  The color and shape of the trusses on VB-10,000 have earned it the nickname, *Golden Arches*, after McDonald’s signature logo.

The heavy-lift was designed to clear debris from toppled oil drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.  VB-10,000 is capable of lifting 7,500 short tons in a single lift. The trusses straddle two 300′ long barges controlled by dynamic positioning thrusters for station-keeping without anchors and mooring lines. 

The USCG video, below, shows the VB-10,000 mooring at the Port of Fernandina, Fla., July 3, 2020, for final modifications and function checks prior to heading to St. Simons Sound in early to mid-July. The two 255-foot tall gantries will use lengths of chain to cut the capsized vessel *Golden Ray* into eight pieces and lift them onto barges for transportation to Louisiana for recycling.
