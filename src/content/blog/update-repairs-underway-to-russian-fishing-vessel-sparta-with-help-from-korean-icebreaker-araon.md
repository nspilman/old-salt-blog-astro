The Russian fishing vessel [*Sparta*, which was holed by ice](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/16/russian-fishing-vessel-sparta-listing-after-striking-sea-ice-in-antarctica/) below the waterline in the Ross Sea off Antarctica on December 16th and has been trapped in the ice for over ten days, is now undergoing temporary repairs.  On Monday, the [Korean icebreaker *Araon*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Araon) arrived and began transferring fuel to the stricken fishing vessel in order to increase the trim by the stern to allow the damaged area on the bow to be above the waterline.  The crews of both ships are now attempting to weld doubler plates on the inside and outside of the ship in way the damaged hull plates.  Once the doublers are welded, the *Araon w*ill attempt to escort the *Sparta* back through the ice to open water. Thanks to Phil Leon for pointing out the video.
