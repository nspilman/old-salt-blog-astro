MV Blida hijacked on New Years Day in the Gulf of Aden

Today is the first day back to work for many after a bit of time off for the holidays. And how has the New Year begun?   More or less the same as the last year which just ended.  On the New Years Eve, the [North Korean freighter,  the Kang Bong sank.](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/01/01/china.ship.sinks/index.html) Three crew were rescued,  two were confirmed dead and fifteen remain missing.   (Thanks to Phil for passing along the article.)  On a  very different note, New Years Eve also saw the start of the [Barcelona World Race](http://www.barcelonaworldrace.org/en/), the  “first only double-handed (two-crew) regatta around the world.”   Fifteen boats are competing in the non-stop race.   Piracy remains with us. On New Year’s Day, the 20,586 tonne [Algerian bulker, MV Blida](http://www.sabanews.net/en/news232260.htm) ,  with a crew, of 27 was hijacked by pirates in the Gulf of Aden.   Also on New Year’s Day, the US Navy ended all smoking on US submarines.  Nicotine gum and patches will be available for the estimated 40% of submariners who smoke. We wish them all the very best during the no-doubt difficult transition.  See our [post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/04/27/the-end-of-smoking-on-navy-submarines/) from last April.

So, we have had a mixed start to the new year. Let us all hope that it is better than the last.
