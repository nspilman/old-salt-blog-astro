![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/niagara2.jpg)Officials from the [Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission](https://www.phmc.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx) (PHMC) have confirmed that Brig *Niagara*, Pennsylvania’s Flagship, will sail the Great Lakes again this summer.

[Erie News Now](https://www.erienewsnow.com/story/45789134/the-flagship-niagara-to-sail-again-in-2022) reports that because of concerns over COVID-19, *Niagara* hasn’t sailed since 2019 — except to travel to dry dock in Cleveland for some critical maintenance and repairs.

In a news release issued in December by the [Flagship Niagara League](https://sailfnl.org/), as the freshly repaired and repainted brig returned to the Port of Erie, officials said, “Once inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard, dockside tours will resume at the [Erie Maritime Museum](https://www.eriemaritimemuseum.org/).  Next year, (2022) *Niagara* will return to her normal schedule of sail training and sailing to all five Great Lakes as part of Tall Ships Challenge in 2022.”

The PHMC said *Niagara* is also expected to join in the return of the [Tall Ships Erie Festival](https://www.tallshipserie.org/) scheduled in August, barring any pandemic issues.

Billy Sabatini, Executive Director, and Fleet Captain at the Flagship Niagara League can’t wait to begin sailing again.  He said that’s what makes the *Niagara* Pennsylvania’s ambassador of the Great Lakes.  

The current *Niagara*, the third reconstruction of the original vessel, was launched in Erie in 1988 for the 175th anniversary of the Battle of Lake Erie.
