![vanner1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/10/vanner1.jpg)In December, Antione Vanner’s “Britannia’s X,” the third of his Dawlish chronicles will be published by [Old Salt Press](http://oldsaltpress.com/).  No, the book’s title will not be “Britannia’s X.” From Antoine’s [Dawlish Chronicles](http://dawlishchronicles.blogspot.co.uk/) blog:

*The title, for now, is “Britannia’s X” – with “X” being undisclosed for now. I’m therefore offering signed copies of the novel to the first three successful guesses as to what “X” stands for.* *The first two books in the series have been [Britannia’s Wolf](http://www.amazon.com/Britannias-Wolf-Chronicles-September-February-ebook/dp/B00CLHET9S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1413470201&sr=1-1&keywords=Britannia%E2%80%99s+Wolf) and [Britannia’s Reach](http://www.amazon.com/Britannias-Reach-Dawlish-Chronicles-November-ebook/dp/B00I9I8DWC/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1413470201&sr=1-2&keywords=Britannia%E2%80%99s+Wolf), so what could the “X” possibly be?*

*The only clues I’m offering are (a) that the action covers the period April – September1881, (b) that the adventure (and nightmare!) starts in the Northern Adriatic but shifts continents thereafter and (c) that Nicholas Dawlish’s intrepid wife, Florence, plays a key role.*
