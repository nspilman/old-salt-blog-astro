In [our review](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/08/v-e-uletts-novel-captain-blackwells-prize-a-review/) of *Captain Blackwell’s Prize,* we wrote:  What makes [*Captain Blackwell’s Prize*](http://www.amazon.com/Captain-Blackwells-Prize-Adventures-ebook/dp/B00E82DH2Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1375819500&sr=1-1&keywords=ulett) so entertaining is that it falls equally well in the categories of nautical adventure and historical romance. It is the sort of novel that readers of C.S. Forester and Patrick O’Brian can enjoy along with fans of Jane Austen and Daphne du Maurier. … A fun and fascinating read. Highly recommended.
