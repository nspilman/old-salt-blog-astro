Maritime enthusiasts are attempting to raise money to save the [USS *Ling*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Ling), a War War II vintage Balao-class submarine, from a likely date with the scrap yard. They hope to move the submarine from where it is currently stuck in the mud in the Hackensack River to the Ohio River as part of a World War II-focused [Louisville Naval Museum.](https://louisvillenavalmuseuminc.org/)

For several years, things have not been going well for USS *Ling.* The submarine has been tied up along the Hackensack River since 1972. For over three decades it was operated as a museum ship and was the centerpiece of the [New Jersey Naval Museum.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Naval_Museum) The museum operated from a riverfront site which they leased from the newspaper, The Record, later part of the [North Jersey Media Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Jersey_Media_Group), for a nominal $1 per year. That ended in January 2007, when the owner of the site, informed the museum that the site was going to be sold for redevelopment within the year and that the museum and submarine would need to be relocated. 

When Hurricane Sandy hit the northeast in 2012, it destroyed the dock and gangway that provided access to the submarine, causing the museum to shut down. The redevelopment of the property continued however in 2018.

Also in 2018, [vandals broke into the sub, stealing plaques and opening values](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/08/wwii-submarine-uss-ling-vandalized-plaques-stolen-sub-flooded/) causing the submarine to flood. The extent of the damage has never been fully assessed.

So now the USS *Ling* is inaccessible from shore and sitting in the river mud. That mud may prove to be one of the biggest challenges to moving the beleaguered 312-foot-long submarine. The Hackensack River has silted significantly in the 47 years that the *Ling* has been tied up along the river bank. Once dredged for barge traffic, it is now deep enough only for shallow draft small craft.

The submarine is also directly upstream from the [Court Street Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_Street_Bridge_\(Hackensack_River\)), a swing bridge built in 1908, which may present its own issues. It is also not clear what the condition of the submarine’s hull may be and what repairs may still be needed if the craft is successfully extracted from the river’s mud.  

The mission to save the old submarine is reportedly being headed up by two veterans, Mark Gatton and Lewis Palmer. The [Air Force Times](https://www.airforcetimes.com/veterans/military-history/2019/11/17/air-force-and-army-veteran-duo-aims-to-restore-wwii-submarine/) reports: The Navy still owns the submarine but is not contributing to its restoration. However, Gatton said several sailors from a naval base in Connecticut have volunteered their time. Since their initial visit, it has been pumped dry, patched and pressure washed.

It’s a start, but they still have a long way to go. Gatton dreams that one day the submarine will anchor a museum that is like a step back in time to the 1940s, with tour guides dressed in period clothing, and cars and buildings that look like they’re from the WWII era.

But first, the old submarine needs to be dragged out of the river mud.
