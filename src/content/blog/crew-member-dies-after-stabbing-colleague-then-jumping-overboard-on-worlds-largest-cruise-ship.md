![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/iconoftheseas2.jpg)A crew member on Royal Caribbean’s [*Icon of the Seas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_of_the_Seas) is reported to have stabbed a fellow crew member multiple times before jumping overboard to his death as the ship cruised off the coast of San Salvador Island in the Bahamas on Thursday night.

According to the Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBPF), the unidentified male crew member allegedly stabbed a female co-worker during a dispute.

“Shortly before 7:30 p.m., a 28-year-old South African female crew member was allegedly stabbed multiple times by another crew member, a 35-year-old South African male,” reads an RBPF press release.

“Following the incident, the male reportedly fled from the scene and jumped into the water. He was retrieved unresponsive and pronounced dead by onboard medical staff,” the RBPF statement continued.

The woman crew member suffered stab wounds to her upper body and is in stable condition, according to police.

A statement by Royal Caribbean said, “Our crew immediately initiated a search and rescue operation, but unfortunately, the crew member passed away. We extend our condolences to the crew member’s family and loved ones. To respect their privacy, we have no additional details to share. “ 

At the time of the incident, *Icon of the Seas* was sailing northwest, during a day at sea. Satellite tracking data shows the ship’s course change just northeast of San Salvador Island in the Bahamas, roughly 200 miles east of Nassau.

According to guests onboard, the overboard occurred from the ship’s port side, and life preservers were dropped over the side to help assist the individual and mark the overboard location.

At 248,663 GT, almost 1,200′ long, with a maximum passenger capacity of 7,600 guests and 2,350 crew, the *Icon of the Seas* is currently the world’s largest cruise ship.
