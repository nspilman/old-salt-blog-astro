![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/fitz2.jpg)The US Navy courts-martial of the officers of the USS *Fitzgerald* have begun. The Arleigh Burke-class [destroyer collided with the Philippine-flagged container ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/06/destroyer-uss-fitzgerald-collides-container-ship-seven-missing/), ACX *Crystal* near Yokosuka, Japan on June 17, 2017, killing 9 US sailors. A Navy investigation concluded that the collision was caused by ineffective watchstanding and failure of the bridge crew to respond in a timely manner and change course to avoid the collision.

Yesterday, Lt. j.g. Sarah Coppock, the junior officer responsible for navigation at the time of the collision, pleaded guilty to the charge of dereliction of duty.  According to a Navy statement, she received a punitive letter and will forfeit half a month’s pay for three months as part of her sentence.

Lt. Coppock is the first of a series of hearings. [Military Times](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/04/30/hearing-date-set-commander-uss-fitzgerald-collision.html) reports that two more junior officers will appear at an Article 32 hearing today. An Article 23 hearing determines whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a full court-martial. Cmdr. Bryce Benson, the former commanding officer of the *Fitzgerald* is scheduled to appear at an Article 32 investigative hearing May 21.

In February, former *Fitzgerald* executive officer Cmdr. Sean Babbitt and former command master chief Brice Baldwin were [found guilty at non-judicial punishment proceedings](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/02/01/uss-fitzgerald-xo-cmc-reprimanded-dereliction-hearings-announced.html) for dereliction of duty and were given punitive letters of reprimand.

One other officer also received a reprimand, and another had a finding of guilt set aside. Another officer and an enlisted sailor from the Fitzgerald had charges dismissed.
