*Marking the 70th anniversary of the German invasion and occupation of the Channel Islands, Yesterday travels across the Channel to revisit a World War II story often forgotten.*

*This brand-new and exclusive series, written and presented by Midsomer Murders star John Nettles, is an emotional examination of both the invasion and occupation, as well as the legacy it left behind.*

*From June 1940, when the Nazis arrived, until May 1945, the inhabitants of Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney and Sark lived through five years of oppression, terror, collaboration and near starvation that left an indelible scar that’s still evident 70 years later.*
