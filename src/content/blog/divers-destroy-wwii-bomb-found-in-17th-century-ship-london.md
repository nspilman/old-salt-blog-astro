![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/10/wrecklondon.jpg)Civilian divers were on an archeological dive on the [*London*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_\(1656_English_ship\)), a Royal Navy ship built-in 1656 which exploded and sank in 1665 in the Thames Estuary. They were shocked to find a large World War II bomb in the wreck. And it wasn’t just any bomb. [The BBC reports](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-49863564) that it was a German parachute ground mine, at 987kg (2,175lbs) one of the biggest bombs used by the Luftwaffe during the war.

A team of eight Royal Navy bomb disposal experts worked for six days in poor visibility to retrieve the bomb, which was then detonated five miles away, at a disposal site at Shoeburyness, off the Essex coast.

In 1665, the powder magazine on the *London*, a 76-gun second-rate ship of the line, spontaneously exploded, killing 300 of her crew and sending the ship to the bottom. The wreck was rediscovered in 2005,  causing authorities to change the route of the nearby shipping channel to prevent further damage to the wreck. In 2015, an intact gun carriage was lifted from the seabed near the wreck site. 

Exactly how the World War II bomb came to rest in the 17th-century wreck is unclear.
