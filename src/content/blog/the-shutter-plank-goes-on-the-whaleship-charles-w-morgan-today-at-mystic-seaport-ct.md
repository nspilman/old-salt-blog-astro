![morgan1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/morgan1.jpg)**Correction**:  The original post listed the wrong date for the anticipated launching of the  *Charles W. Morgan.* The correct date is  July 21, 2013.

Congratulations to the [Mystic Seaport Museum](http://www.mysticseaport.org/) and all those working on the whaleship *[Charles W. Morgan](http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&page_id=B3E63C64-B3CA-45AE-A83D72C303A9C6BF)*.  This afternoon at around 2PM,  the final plank, the “shutter plank” fastened to the hull of the historic whaleship.  The plank is called the “shutter plank” because it shuts in and completes the hull.  The *Charles W. Morgan*, built in 1841, is America’s last surviving wooden whaleship and has been undergoing a five year restoration at the [Henry B. duPont Preservation Shipyard](http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&page_id=05F74191-D78C-D0C6-64E2AB6C7E72F3B6) at the Mystic Seaport in Mystic, CT.  If all goes well, the Morgan will be re-launched on July 21, 2013.
