Last Monday night, the lights went out for over 8 million people in the Northeast and Central United States as Superstorm Sandy sent high winds and a record storm surge ashore. It was the worst storm to hit New York harbor since the city was founded in 1624.  The more than 9 foot surge on top of a high tide on a full moon resulted in water level’s at New York’s Battery approaching 14 feet, far surpassing the record of 11.2′ water level recorded during the great hurricane of 1821.

Forty people died in New York City alone. Close to one hundred people have died in the storm in the Untied States with another sixty or so killed when Sandy tore through the Caribbean.

On Monday night, I watched as the storm surge rolled up the streets on three sides of my home in downtown Jersey City, stopping within a few hundred feet of our doorstep before receding on the falling tide. We were extremely lucky. Many of our friends lost their homes or their belongings.

But we are back. The electricity, heat, phone have all returned as if by magic. I have reliable internet access again.   Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://alaricbond.com/) for watching over the site while I lacked reliable access and thanks for all the good wishes from so many readers and contributors.
