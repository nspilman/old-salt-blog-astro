![northrivertugrace](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/northrivertugrace.jpg)The 22nd annual running of the [Great North River Tugboat Race and Competition](http://workingharbor.com/tugrace_home.html) is coming up on Labor Day off Pier 84, which is at West 44th Street and the Hudson River in Manhattan.  The race is sponsored by the [Working Harbor Committee](http://workingharbor.com/) & [Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises](http://www.circleline42.com/new-york-cruises/home.aspx).  You can watch the race from shore, or for an even closer view, tickets are available on the [Circle Line Spectator boat](http://www.nycharities.org/events/EventLevels.aspx?ETID=7377).  If you are anywhere near New York harbor, do stop by. It is the best show around.

The festivities will begin at 10:00 AM with a parade of tugs from Pier 84 to the start line.  The race starts at 10:30 AM from south of the 79th Street Boat Basin to Pier 84.  Following the race, at around 11 AM, there will be nose-to-nose tug pushing contests as well as a line throwing competition.  The tugs will tie up around noon. There will be exhibits, an amateur line toss, and a spinach eating contact for would-be Popeyes of all ages.  The award ceremony will be at 1 PM with the tugs departing around 2 PM.
