![libertychallenge-race](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/06/libertychallenge-race.jpg)I will admit that it was news to me that the [Hawaiian Airlines Liberty Challenge](http://www.libertyoutrigger.org/) hosted by [New York Outrigger](http://newyorkoutrigger.org/) is the largest outrigger regatta on the East Coast.  Over 400 athletes from around the world are participating.  According to the [New York Outrigger website](http://newyorkoutrigger.org/liberty/), “*since 1997, the Liberty Challenge has grown to become one of the most prestigious outrigger canoe races in the world. The race is unique among world outrigger regattas as it takes place in a bustling urban harbor.*

*Each summer crews from across the country, Europe and the Pacific travel to New York City to compete in its kinetic waters. Crews not only have to gauge the strong tidal currents with their dramatic and sudden shifts, but they must also negotiate the vast number of ferries, cruise ships, tour boats, barges, tankers and pleasure craft that fill New York Harbor, the East River and the Hudson River. Men, women, and co-ed crews race along a challenging and visually-stunning course, which includes landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge and Ellis Island. The regatta is comprised of three races run in heats over the course of the day. The men’s and women’s races cover a 15 mile course, while the mixed race has a truncated course of 11 miles.”*

The race festivities will be located at Pier 26 on the Hudson River.  Sponsors [Hawaiian Airlines](http://www.hawaiianairlines.com/), [Hālāwai](http://www.halawai.org/) and [Kona Brewing](http://konabrewingco.com/) will also be providing entertainment and activities on the pier. The [Kona Beer Garden](http://www.libertyoutrigger.org/liberty-festival/kona-brewing-company-beer-garden/) will be welcoming guests from 12:30pm- 4:30pm, serving up Longboard Lager, Big Wave Golden Ale and Castaway IPA.

Immediately down river at Pier 25, the [North River Historic Ship Festival](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/06/north-river-historic-ship-festival-june-20-june-24/) will also be going strong from Friday, June 20 to Tuesday June 24.  If you are visiting Pier 26 be sure to stop by Pier 25, and vice versa.

The first day of summer looks to be a very busy day in the harbor.
