[An estimated quarter of a million people](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/sailing/route-du-rhum-2014-250000-set-to-line-the-banks-of-brittany-to-wave-off-91-singlehanded-sailors-on-their-wet-and-windy-path-to-exhaustion-9832891.html) lined the docks and the shore at St. Malo in Brittany to watch the start of the [Route du Rhum](http://www.routedurhum.com/) Race, the 4,500 mile trans-Atlantic singlehanded race to Guadeloupe, which is sailed every four years. This time, the race got off to a rough start, in winds averaging 20-25 knots, and gusts of 35 knots, which resulted in [dismastings and the loss of keels or rudders on four boats.](http://www.ybw.com/news/sailing/537559/dramatic-start-to-route-du-rhum-with-a-dismasting-and-a-cargo-ship-collision)  Boats also withdrew after collisions with a dive boat, an unlit buoy and a ship. [Pierre Antione of the Multi50 Olmix](http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/football/premier_league/11579947.Lightning_attack_forces_Route_De_Rhun_sailor_to_abandon_the_race/) was airlifted off his boat after the mast was struck by lightning.  In the first three days of the race, 17 of the 91 racers were forced to withdraw due to a variety of disasters and mishaps.  Fortunately there have been no reported serious injuries among the singlehanders.

One sailor who is reporting no problems is by far the oldest in the fleet. [Sir Robin Knox Johnson is reported to be doing well.](http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/11577407.Sailing_legend_Sir_Robin_avoids_Route_de_Rhun_race_drama_which_has_seen_11_sailors_withdraw_in_first_two_days/) “I have seen gusts to 35 knots and am about 37 miles from Ushant,” Sir Robin reported.   [The 75 year old sailor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Knox-Johnston) is a sailing legend.  In 1969 he became the first man to perform a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation of the globe as the only contestant to complete the [Sunday Times Golden Globe Race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Times_Golden_Globe_Race).  He was also the second winner of the [Jules Verne Trophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_Trophy) (together with Sir Peter Blake).
