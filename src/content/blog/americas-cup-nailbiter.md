![Kiwiemirates2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kiwiemirates2.jpg)After looking like they were in an impossibly deep hole, [Oracle Team USA](http://oracle-team-usa.americascup.com/) has come charging back. Only last Wednesday, [Emirates Team New Zealand](http://emirates-team-new-zealand.americascup.com/) was on the verge of winning the [America’s Cup](http://www.americascup.com/en/results-standings).  They had won 8 of the 9 races necessary for victory while Oracle had only won 3. But, as Oracle had been penalized 2 races for cheating during the prior round of races, the tally board stood at 8-1. Now, Oracle has won the last five races.  In absolute terms Oracle and the Kiwis have both won 8 races and the momentum is clearly on Oracle’s side.  All it will take is the Kiwis winning a single race to take the Cup. Based on the last five races, the next one, two or three races, as necessary, will be hard fought indeed.
