Bush created three marine national monuments](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/05/AR2009010501181_2.html?sid=ST2009010600211) in the Pacific Ocean.  Today, [President Obama announced the dramatic expansion of these marine preserves](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-will-propose-vast-expansion-of-pacific-ocean-marine-sanctuary/2014/06/16/f8689972-f0c6-11e3-bf76-447a5df6411f_story.html) to form the world’s largest marine sanctuary.  Under the proposal, the [Pacific Remote Island Marine National Monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Remote_Islands_Marine_National_Monument) would grow from almost 87,000 square miles to nearly 782,000 square miles — all of it adjacent to seven islands and atolls controlled by the United States.  The sanctuary covers a broad swath of the central Pacific Ocean and will be off-limits to fishing, energy exploration and other activities.  The proposal is slated to go into effect later this year and could double the area of the ocean globally that is fully protected.

“I’m going to use my authority to protect some of our nation’s most precious marine landscapes,” Obama said in a video to participants at a State Department conference, adding that while the ocean is being degraded, “We cannot afford to let that happen. That’s why the United States is leading the fight to protect our oceans.”
