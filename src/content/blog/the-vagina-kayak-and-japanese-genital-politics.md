Rokudenashiko in her vagina boat

Last May, Japanese artist [Megumi Igarashi posted on her blog](http://kotaku.com/yes-the-vagina-boat-finally-became-a-reality-1576771068?rev=1405320553206), *Maybe you were thinking, “Hey, what happened to that [vagina boat](http://kotaku.com/japanese-artist-wants-to-make-a-vagina-boat-554259407)?” Well, good news: The vagina boat finally set sail.  (*Honestly, the question hadn’t crossed my mind.)

Igarashi, who goes by the nickname Rokudenashiko (“the good for nothing girl”), had raised money through crowd-sourcing to fabricate a 3D printed plastic model of her vagina to be installed on a roto-mold kayak.  From the photos, my only issue with the kayak is that there is no place to put on a spray skirt. The Japanese authorities had other concerns.

Shortly after the vagina kayak was launched, Rokudenashiko was arrested and charged with obscenity. She was released a few days later, only to be arrested again in December. She has been charged with distributing obscene material and could face up to two years in jail or a fine of roughly $20,000, if found guilty.

Kanamara Matsuri Festival 2014

What makes this all so bizarre and hypocritical is that Japan has a vibrant pornography and sex industry. The nation also has several yearly festivals which celebrate the penis. Every year, the Japanese celebrate [Kanamara Matsur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanamara_Matsuri)i, the Shinto Festival of the Steel Phallus, a penis festival that is considered family entertainment.  Likewise [Hōnen Matsuri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dnen_Matsuri), is a harvest festival which features a 280 kg (620 pound), 2.5 meter (96 inch)-long wooden phallus which is paraded through the town of Komaki between two shrines.

Large pink phalluses are the focus of national festivals.  Vagina kayaks, on the other hand, apparently are considered a crime.
