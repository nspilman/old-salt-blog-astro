[Battleship Texas taking on extraordinary amounts of water](http://www.kvue.com/news/state/158566665.html)

The battleship [USS Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Texas_\(BB-35\)) was launched 100 years ago on May 19th, 1912.  She is the oldest remaining dreadnought battleship and only one of six surviving ships to have served in both World War I and World War II.

Right now, she is also taking on water fast.  On Saturday, crews discovered what is described as “extraordinary amounts of water” flooding the ship’s engine room.  They still have not been able to identify the source of the leak but have been attempting to manage the flooding with additional pumps.  The ship is also beginning to list.

This is not the first time that the aged ship has sprung a leak.  In June of 2010, [the ship came close to sinking](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/16/fire-in-tampa-lightning-in-the-gulf-and-the-battleship-texas-still-afloat/) but was caught time.  After that close call, [a plan was developed to build a cofferdam around the ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/30/preserving-the-battleship-texas-and-problems-with-the-laffey-again/), to create a dry berth. That was almost two years ago, but shortages of funds have postponed the construction.
