A beautifully shot and edited short video. Jon Kane’s comments:

*I did this film for my friend Buck McAllister who’s family owns McAllister Towing tug boat company. I shot the film with one camera, in real time, during the towing of the* [*Intrepid*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Intrepid_\(CV-11\)) *Warship back to it’s dock on the West Side of Manhattan after it’s refurbishment. I shot with a Panasonic HVX 200 camera with a polarizer filter and I cut and colored in Final Cut Pro using all the basic tools that come with Final Cut. Nothing fancy.*
