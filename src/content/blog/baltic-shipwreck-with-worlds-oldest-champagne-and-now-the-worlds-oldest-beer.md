In July, we posted about a Baltic shipwreck on which divers found 30 bottles of champagne thought to pre-date the French Revolution. (see [Baltic Bubbly – ‘World’s oldest champagne’](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/18/worlds-oldest-champagne-found-on-baltic-seabed/))   On subsequent dives, smaller bottles have been recovered which apparently contain beer.  Let’s hope they keep exploring. Who knows what they may find next.

*“In all probability this is the world’s oldest beer. We can now say that we have both the world’s oldest champagne and the world’s oldest beer bottles in our hands,” said Rainer Juslin Department of Åland in the press release.*

*The temperature and the darkness has been done to optimize the storage and pressure in the bottles have not been able to salt water to penetrate through the corks.*

*The market value of the champagne bottles have been assessed by experts to be equivalent to hundreds of thousands per bottle. The economic value of beer is still unclear.*

Thanks to Alan Nothnagle of the [Lost in Berlin](http://open.salon.com/blog/lost_in_berlin) blog for pointing out the ancient brew.
