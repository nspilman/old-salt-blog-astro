![kiwspirit](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/01/kiwspirit.jpg)In early December, [we posted about Stanley Paris’ attempt](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/12/bon-voyage-to-captain-stanley-paris-and-the-kiwi-spirit/) at a solo circumnavigation in his 63′ *Kiwi Spirit* after suffering a variety failures to rigging and sails, Paris has decided to give up the attempt and sail for Cape Town.  Today, he posted the following message on his blog:

[***The Fears We Don’t Give Thought To***](http://stanleyparis.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-fears-we-dont-give-thought-to.html)

*It’s now clear to me that there are times in life where we defensively deny giving thought to our innermost fears. Such is the situation with me aboard Kiwi Spirit. After 41 days at sea, I was beginning to see that bit-by-bit the yacht was not ready for the worst that the Southern Ocean could deliver – anywhere from five to ten gales, and one or two storms. This boat could no longer, in its present state, handle such forces, and I knew deep down that I was not prepared to give voice to it. Then a member of my team did, and the rest, including me, agreed. Surprisingly a great sense of relief came over me, for now I could recognize and give voice to my mounting concerns and fears. Yes, I still have to get through the next six days in this ocean and make it to Cape Town. I will do my best to nurse her along. The fat lady has not yet been heard singing.*  *I still have to make it to Cape Town and will need to nurse this ship all the way.*
