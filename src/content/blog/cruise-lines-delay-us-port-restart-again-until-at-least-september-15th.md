![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carnival-restart.jpg)In mid-March, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) announced that the major cruise lines were [shutting down operations from all US ports for at least 30 days](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/03/us-cruise-industry-shutting-down-for-at-least-30-days/) in response to the coronavirus pandemic. A month later, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) extended its “[No Sail Order](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/04/cdc-modifies-extends-no-sail-order-for-all-cruise-ships/)” fro up to 100 days. Nevertheless, by mid-May, the major cruise lines were planning [restarting operations in July and August.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/05/tens-of-thousands-fo-crew-still-stranded-as-cruise-lines-plan-reopening/)

Now, reality has set in, once again and the CLIA announced last Friday that the [major cruise lines will not attempt starting operations from the US until September 15th](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/cruise-lines-voluntarily-suspend-all-trips-out-of-us-ports-until-sept-15-trade-group-says.html).

Whether the latest date is any more likely than the previous targets remains to be seen. Recently, a White House advisor raised concerns about a [second wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic this fall,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/22/coronavirus-live-updates-us/) as 29 states and U.S. territories logged an increase in their seven-day average of newly reported cases after many lifted restrictions in recent weeks.
