![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/07/firebhr3.jpg)A [fire broke out](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/07/fire-rages-on-amphibious-assault-ship-uss-bonhomme-richard-close-to-60-injured/) on the amphibious assault ship [USS *Bonhomme Richard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bonhomme_Richard_\(LHD-6\)) on July 12 while the ship was dockside at the Naval Base San Diego. Now, the Navy is investigating whether arson was the cause of the fire. A sailor from the ship is a prime suspect. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) are leading the investigation. No motive has been identified and no one has been charged.  

The fire burned for more than four days and severely damaged the ship. [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/27/906544699/navy-investigating-whether-fire-aboard-uss-bonhomme-richard-was-arson) reports that after touring the damage in July, the Navy’s top officer, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday, suggested that the 22-year-old vessel may be a total loss.

According to documents provided by the Navy, over the last decade there were nine serious fires on board Navy ships around the world and seven of those fires were on board ships in port, most undergoing maintenance.

The *Bonhomme Richard* is a Wasp-class amphibious assault ship, 844 feet in length and resembling a small aircraft carrier. It is used to transport a Marine detachment, its equipment and aircraft. The *Bonhomme Richard* was one of the first vessels being retrofitted to carry the new F-35B Joint Strike Fighter, setting back plans to deploy the new stealth fighter jet on amphibious assault ships.
