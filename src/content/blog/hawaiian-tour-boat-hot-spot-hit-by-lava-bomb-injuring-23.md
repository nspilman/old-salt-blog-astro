![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lavabomb.jpg)On Monday, the name [“*Hot Spot*“](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hawaii-volcano-tours/hawaii-tour-boats-return-to-volcano-zone-after-lava-bomb-idUSKBN1K711G) proved dangerously prophetic for a tour boat operating in waters off the coast of Kapoho on the Big Island of Hawaii.  The tour boat was carrying about 49 passengers at around 6 AM, observing the flow of lava into the sea from the Kilauea volcano, when the boat was struck by a lava explosion.

A basketball-sized “lava bomb” hit the roof of the tour boat, injuring at least 23 passengers. One woman who suffered a broken femur was later airlifted to the Queen’s Medical Center on Oahu for emergency treatment. The boat named “*Hot Spot*” returned to Wailoa Harbor in Hilo with the injured passengers. Four passengers, including the woman who was later airlifted to Oahu, were taken by ambulance to the Hilo Medical Center.

The Coast Guard has now revised its rules for tour boats observing the lava flows. The previous rules allowed boats to get as close as 50 meters. The rule now requires staying at least 300 meters from the flow.

The current eruption began in early May and has now destroyed over 700 homes.
