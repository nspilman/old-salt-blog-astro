[Documentary filmmakers Yvonne Drebert and Zach Melnick](https://youtu.be/Nd4sML1nCwM?si=bAc1iAZ2Mvuv3STM) were looking for invasive mussels on the bottom of Lake Huron in Canada when they came across the 150-foot-long [shipwreck of the *Africa*](https://www.bayshorebroadcasting.ca/2023/10/10/shipwreck-found-off-the-bruce-peninsula-though-to-be-the-africa/).

On the morning of 4 October 1895, the *Africa* departed from Ashtabula, Ohio, carrying coal over Lake Huron to Owen Sound, Ontario. But it didn’t make it. The ship sank in during an early-season snowstorm. The steamer’s 11-person crew died.

Drebert and Melnick aren’t saying exactly where they’ve located the ship because it’s now considered a protected grave site, but she does say it’s off the west coast of the Bruce Peninsula in about 280 feet of water or 85 metres down.
