Colin Green, warns “We have a problem.” The sentence was in bold-faced print and underlined. The letter follows a series of incidents of alleged misbehavior by the elite special operations forces, including alleged illegal activity by two Navy SEAL teams.

Also, toward the end of July, an [entire platoon of SEAL commandos](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/navy-seal-platoon-withdrawn-iraq.html) was abruptly removed from Iraq after reports of serious misconduct and a breakdown of discipline. The Navy is investigating reports that Foxtrot Platoon of SEAL Team 7, held a Fourth of July party where some members consumed alcohol against regulations, and that a senior enlisted member of the platoon had raped a female service member attached to the platoon.

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/politics/navy-seals-collin-green-service-members-misbehavior/index.html) reports that Rear Adm. Collin Green has given commanders until August 7 to detail the problems they see and provide recommendations on how they will ensure troops are engaging in ethical and professional behavior.  
The letter — dated July 25 and exclusively obtained by CNN — comes in the wake of several high profile incidents of alleged misbehavior by SEALs.

“I don’t know yet if we have a culture problem, I do know that we have a good order and discipline problem that must be addressed immediately,” Green said.
