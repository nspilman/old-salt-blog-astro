![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sfaulkner.jpg)We have posted in the past about the heroic and pioneering [US Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer Sara Faulkner.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/on-international-womens-day-an-interview-with-rescue-swimmer-sarah-faulkner/) She was the first of only a handful of women who have qualified and served as rescue swimmers. Faulkner joined the Coast Guard intent upon becoming a rescue swimmer, so she knew that she would be called upon to serve in the most extreme rescue situations. What she didn’t anticipate was almost two decades of sexual harassment and assault.

The [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/article238336883.html) reports that “once sent to do the job she loved, rescuing people from helicopter drops, Faulkner said she endured groping, licking, butt smacking, leering and crude sexual innuendos meant to humiliate her in front of colleagues.”

Now retired, Faulkner is speaking out against the abuse and being retaliated against for reporting the abuse. In the video below, Faulkner describes in her own words the harassment and abuse that she suffered.

Sadly, it appears that Sara Faulkner’s experience is not unique.  The Coast Guard denies systemic harassment but two recent reports paint a different picture. A report from this December, issued by the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight  Committee was titled, [Righting the Ship — The Coast Guard Must Improve its Processes for Addressing Harassment, Bullying, and Retaliation.](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/RTS%20Final%20Report.pdf) The report criticized Coast Guard leaders for failing to investigate hazing and bullying at the Coast Guard Academy and suggested the problem affects rank-and-file service members. The report notes that “In July 2019, 45 percent of female cadets reported that they had experienced sexual harassment.”

The Coast Guard hired the Rand Corporation to investigate why retention rates among women were lower than men in the service. The [report](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB10058.html?utm_medium=rand_social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=oea), issued in April 2019, cited fears of sexual assault and harassment, especially in “units with only one or two women assigned and units in remote, isolated environments.“

It also cited “perceptions that bad leaders are retained and even promoted; that male leaders are reluctant to mentor women; and that leaders were unaware of Coast Guard policies” affecting women.
