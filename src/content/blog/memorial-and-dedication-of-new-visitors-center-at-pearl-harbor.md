*At 7:55 a.m., the exact moment the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor began 69 years ago, a moment of silence will be observed.  The *­­­­­­­­USS Chafee* (DDG 90) will render honors to the *USS Arizona*. Military aircraft will fly over the Memorial in a “missing man” formation. A Hawaiian blessing and dedication of the new Pearl Harbor Visitor Center will follow. The ceremony will conclude with a “Walk of Honor” by more than 200 Pearl Harbor survivors and World II veterans through an honor cordon of armed services and National Park Service men and women to officially open the new visitor center museum.*
