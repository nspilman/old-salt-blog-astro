The Dutch Sail Training Ship, [*Astrid*](http://atseasailtraining.com/177/ships/4/astrid.html), a 136′ (41.65 M) brig, was lost this morning after running aground on rocks on the western mouth of Oysterhaven, on the Cork, Ireland coast, shortly after leaving the anchorage this morning.  Thirty crew and trainees were rescued  by the the [RNLI Courtmacsherry](http://rnli.org/findmynearest/station/Pages/Courtmacsherry-Harbour-Lifeboat-Station.aspx) all-weather lifeboat and a local sail training vessel, [*Spirit of Oysterhaven*](https://www.facebook.com/OysterhavenCrew?ref=stream&hc_location=timeline), after the *Astrid* began to sink in force five to six winds.

The waters off the southern Irish coast can be treacherous. One report by [uptherockies](http://www.youtube.com/user/uptherockies?feature=watch) places the wreck of the *Astrid* on the Sovereign Rocks at Oysterhaven near Kinsale, Cork where the [*Falls of Garry* was wrecked](http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?10493) on October 20, 1911.

The *Astrid* was participating in the [Gathering Cruise](http://www.sailing.ie/ISANews/tabid/115/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/39884/The-Gathering-Cruise.aspx) preceding the [Gathering Regatta at Kinsale](http://kinsale.ie/event/kinsale-regatta-festival-incorporating-the-homecoming-festival-gathering/).

The *Astrid*‘s history, from the [At Sea Sail Training website](http://atseasailtraining.com/177/ships/4/astrid.html):

*The Astrid was built in 1918 as a freight logger in a Dutch shipyard. The ship was sold of due to the decease of the Swedish Captain Albert Edmund Frohm and the diminished demand for coasters of this seize. Since 1970 it sailed under the Lebanese flag and the wildest rumours were spread involving drug smuggling. Below the English coast a fierce fire aboard the ship ended the alleged practices. The pensioned English Marine Officers Graham Neilson and John Amos (from Class Yachts Endeavour) saved the iron body from the breakers. The Astrid was completely renovated and equipped with impressive brig rigging. Nowadays it has returned sailing under the Dutch flag.*
