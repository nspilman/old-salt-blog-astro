![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SouthStreetSeaportBanner200.jpg)New York can be a tough town. Despite rough and tumble struggles over real estate, the vagaries of city politics, economic downturns, and not the least, being struck head-on my a monster hurricane which sent a 10′ storm surge through its buildings, the [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/) has not only survived, but is thriving. They have recently completed an incredible restoration of the 1885 windjammer *[Wavertree,](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/visit/street-of-ships/wavertree/)* the largest iron sailing vessel afloat, and are rebuilding their shore-side exhibits.  And this Saturday, April 29th, the South Street Seaport is celebrating the beginning of its second 50 years with a community celebration from 11am to 5pm.

From the museum announcement: This family-friendly event will include **free admission** to all of the Museum’s offerings within the historic seaport district, including tours of its current exhibitions *Street of Ships: The Port and Its People*, *The Original Gus Wagner. The Maritime Roots of Modern Tattoo*, and *The Architecture of Trade: Schermerhorn Row and the Seaport*; tours of the historic ships *Ambrose* and *Wavertree*; printing demonstrations at the Bowne print shops at 209-211 Water Street; and fun family activities and music on Pier 16. The 50th anniversary year will be inaugurated with a special bell-ringing ceremony aboard the lightship *Ambrose* with special guest New York City Council Majority Leader Jimmy Van Bramer ringing *Ambrose*‘s 110 year old bronze bell at 1:00pm. Honored guests will also include Council Member Margaret Chin, Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, Commissioner of Cultural Affairs Tom Finkelpearl, and the trustees, members, friends, and volunteers of the South Street Seaport Museum.

The lightship *Ambrose*, a floating lighthouse, stood watch at the front door to New York Harbor during the greatest period of immigration in US history. She was a critical aid to navigation, helping cargo and passenger ships to safely enter New York, but she had another vital role as well. She was the first thing an immigrant would see as they entered New York Harbor, long before the buildings and piers on the waterfront, long before the Manhattan skyline, and long before the lighted torch of Lady Liberty; *Ambrose* served as the first beacon of liberty to an arriving soon-to-be American. The Seaport Museum celebrates the immigration that built New York and the United States by ringing the bell of *Ambrose*, the lightship of liberty, in loud and clear announcement of New York’s fundamental value of tolerance.

April 2017 marks fifty years since the Museum received its charter from the New York State Department of Education Board of Regents. Over that fifty years the Museum has grown dramatically, collecting artifacts and works of art documenting the rise of New York as a port city.; developing and implementing innovative and award-winning programming; mounting exhibitions; and preserving a fleet of historic ships on the East River. Despite three massive setbacks: the 9/11 attacks, the Great Recession of 2008, and the floodwaters of hurricane Sandy, the museum is growing once again. With support from New York City and a dedicated group of staff, volunteers, members and friends, the Seaport Museum remains an educational and cultural gem in lower Manhattan.

The Seaport Museum’s 50th anniversary will be marked throughout the year with the opening of new exhibitions, including Millions: Migrants and Millionaires aboard the Great Liners, 1900-1914 (opening June 2017), artistic and musical performances, lectures and book talks, walking tours, and a formal 50th anniversary cocktail reception aboard the 1885 ship Wavertree in September.

Capt. Jonathan Boulware, Executive Director of the Museum, spoke enthusiastically about the anniversary. “It’s a great privilege to celebrate the five-decade life of this vital institution. We’re here in the original fabric of old New York, the ships, the piers, the 19th-century buildings. It’s the history of New York, but the topics we cover are still highly relevant today. The original values that made New York what it is, the Dutch values of trade and tolerance, the New York values of immigration, of multiculturalism, and of ambition, these all touch on urgent issues of New York and America today. Indeed, as we celebrate this important anniversary, we’re also celebrating the very best of New York values, past, present, and future.”
