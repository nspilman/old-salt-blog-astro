![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/03/felicityann.jpg)The [Northwest School of Wooden Boat Building](http://www.nwboatschool.org/) in Port Hadlock, WA, is restoring a forgotten piece of sailing history –  the *[Felicity Ann](http://felicityann.com/)*, a 23′ wooden boat, launched in 1949.  In 1952-1953, [Ann Davison,](http://www.windlasscreative.com/shshof_web/ann_davison.htm) at 39, sailed  the *Felicity Ann* single-handed across the Atlantic, becoming the first woman ever to do so.

The project is a partnership between Northwest School of Wooden Boat Building, the [Community Boat Project](http://communityboats.wordpress.com/) and [WSU Jefferson County 4-H](http://county.wsu.edu/jefferson/youth/Pages/default.aspx). From the *[Felicity Ann](http://felicityann.com/)* website:  
  
*Felicity Ann is a symbol of human effort and strength. From conception, this sloop was destined to inspire and empower people, and here at the Community Boat Project/Northwest School of Wooden Boatbuilding, we believe she is ready to continue doing just that.* 

*… In this program, we hope to create maritime learning experiences for the community. We are especially interested in working with at-risk young Ladies,High school age and up, with an interest in learning hands on skills. From woodworking to sailing to art projects, we generally do a lot in a day, we hope you will find a way to join us.*

*When Felicity Ann is ready to be launched, we will use her as a sail-training vessel and a floating museum.*

Ann Davison (1914–1992) was a remarkable woman indeed.  She was an airplane pilot and civilian flight instructor for the Royal Air Force during World War II.  After the war, she and her husband, Frank, also a pilot, set off  to sail to the West Indies in their 70′ ketch Reliance, only to be driven ashore on the Dorset Coast where Frank was drowned.  Ann survived and despite not knowing how to sail or navigate, was determined to continue sailing.  In December of 1952, she sailed in the *Felicity Ann* from Plymouth England and arrived New York in June of 1953.  She was inducted into the [Single-Handed Sailors’ Hall of Fame](http://www.windlasscreative.com/shshof_web/ann_davison.htm) in 1988.

Thanks to Joseph Rennie on Facebook for pointing out the project.
