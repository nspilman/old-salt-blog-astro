![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mardigras.jpg)Today [Carnival Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_Corporation_%26_plc) is the largest operator of cruise ships in the world with a combined fleet of over 100 vessels across 10 cruise line brands. Back in 1972, however, it owned exactly one ship, the RMS *[Empress of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Empress_of_Canada_\(1960\)),* which they renamed *[Mardi Gras](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/fl-cruise-ships-nostalgia-websites-20141030-story.html).* On the day after Mardi Gras, it seems like a good time to take a quick look back at Carnival’s very first ship.

RMS *Empress of Canada* was an ocean liner built in 1961 by Vickers-Armstrongs, Walker-on-Tyne, England for Canadian Pacific Steamships Ltd.  The liner sailed in the trans-Atlantic trade between Liverpool and Canada for a decade before the growth of air travel drove her and so many other passenger liners from the sea. 

After repainting her stack, the new Carnival Cruise Lines sent the *Mardi Gras* off on her maiden voyage. She didn’t get far. She struck a sandbar and ended up hard aground for several days in plain sight, just outside of Miami Harbor. One newspaper headline read, “*Mardi Gras on the Rocks*.”  The story goes that the ship’s personnel served free drinks from the ship’s bar and kept the party going. Reports were that the stranded passengers had a very good time even if they were aground and the new new cruise line began earning its reputation for operating “Fun Ships.”  

*Mardi Gras* sailed for Carnival for for over 20 years before being replaced by newer and more modern cruise ships. She was sold to [Epirotiki Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epirotiki_Line) in 1993, where she sailed as *Olympic*, *Star of Texas*, *Lucky Star* and finally *Apollon*.  She ended her days in 2003, after 42 years of service.
