The cruise ship [MS Maud](https://www.hurtigruten.com/en-us/expeditions/ships/maud/) was returning to the UK from a 14 night Northern Lights cruise when it was caught in a severe storm in the North Sea. During the storm, the ship was struck by a rogue wave, shattering the windows on the bridge deck. The flooding of the bridge deck resulted in a temporary loss of power as well as damage to the ship’s navigation systems and radars. There were also reports of a loss of bridge steering control that was taken over by an engine room backup.

The 266 passengers and 131 crew members aboard the *Maud* are safe, according to the Danish Joint Rescue Coordination Centre. 

The ship, owned and operated by cruise company HX, a unit of Norway’s Hurtigruten Group. left Floroe in Norway on Thursday and was due to arrive in Tilbury in the UK on Friday.  The *Maud* is now being towed to Bremerhaven in Germany, Danish authorities said.

A spokesperson for the Danish Joint Rescue Coordination Centre said “An [Esvagt shi](https://esvagt.com/about/about-us/)p is towing it slowly towards Bremerhaven in Germany at around 8-9 knots,” 

“I don’t think there is any danger to the ship now. If the captain thought so, he would have asked to be evacuated which he hasn’t,” the [rescue centre spokesperson said](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/norwegian-cruise-ship-loses-navigation-ability-north-sea-during-storm-2023-12-21/).

The area was hit by a storm late on Thursday with hurricane-force gusts blowing from the northwest that were forecast to continue on Friday, the Danish Meteorological Institute said.
