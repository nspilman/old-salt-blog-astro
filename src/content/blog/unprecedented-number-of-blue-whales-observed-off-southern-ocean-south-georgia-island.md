![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/02/blue2.jpg)[Mother Nature Network](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/stories/antarctic-blue-whales-make-unprecedented-comeback) is reporting that a team of scientists led by the [British Antarctic Survey (BAS)](https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/return-of-the-whales-to-south-georgia/) counted 55 Antarctic [blue whales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale#cite_note-G.S.Paul2016-4) during their 2020 expedition to the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia — a number they called “unprecedented.” In a previous BAS survey in 2018, only one Antarctic blue whale had been sighted.

In addition to Antarctic blue whales, the team recorded 790 humpback whales during the 21-day survey and estimated that there are now more than 20,000 of them feeding off the island seasonally.

During the period of factory-ship whaling, Antarctic blue whales were hunted to near extinction. From an estimated 239,000 whales in the 1920s, their numbers dropped to a low of roughly 360 in the early 1970s. Since the whaling moratorium of 1982, the Antarctic blue whales have grown in number at an estimated rate of 7% per year.  Recent data suggest that there may now be as many as 10,000 Antarctica blue whales.

As we posted in 2014, the [California blue whale population has rebounded](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/09/great-news-california-blue-whales-rebound-to-near-historic-levels/) so that today it is approximately 97% of pre-whaling levels. While the rebound is good news, in absolute terms, it represents a relatively small group of whales. There are currently around 2,500 California blue whales.

According to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/blue-whale), with whaling outlawed, the main threats to blue whales today are vessel strikes and entanglements in fishing gear.

The blue whale, which can grow to a length of almost 100′ and weigh over 170 tonnes, is the largest animal known to have ever existed.
