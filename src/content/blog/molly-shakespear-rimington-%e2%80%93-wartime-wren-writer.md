![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/03/molly-rimmington.jpg)Molly Shakespear Rimington died at age 93 at the end of January but her obituary only appeared in the Telegraph this week.   She was a fascinating individual.  The daughter of Brigadier Talbot Shakespear, she joined the Women’s Royal Naval Service, WRNS,  popularly and officially known as the Wrens just before the start of World War II.  In 1942 she was given the job of writing the war diary for Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, who was Naval Commander Expeditionary Force, North Africa.

She would later marry the submarine ace, Commander Michael Rimington, DSO and Bar. At her wedding Admiral Sir George Creasy commented that Rimington was marrying a woman “who has a war record almost as distinguished as his own.”
