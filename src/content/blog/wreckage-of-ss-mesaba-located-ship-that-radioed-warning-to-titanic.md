In April of 1912, the cargo-passenger liner [SS *Mesaba*](https://www.titanicinquiry.org/ships/mesaba.php) radioed an ice warning to RMS *Titanic*. The message was received but never made it to the bridge. 

The supposedly unsinkable *Titanic* then hit an iceberg and sank on her maiden voyage, with the loss of 1,500 lives. *Mesaba* herself was sunk, by a torpedo in World War I in 1918.

Now, the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63039737) reports that [Bangor University](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/) researchers, using state-of-the art multibeam sonar, have been able to identify the *Mesaba*‘s wreck and pinpoint her final resting place.

The *Mesaba* was one among 273 shipwrecks lying in 7,500 square miles of Irish Sea, which were scanned and cross-referenced against the UK Hydrographic Office’s database of wrecks and other sources. They include trawlers, cargo vessels and submarines as well as large ocean liners and tankers.

*Mesaba*, like *Titanic*, was built in Belfast. The ship was torpedoed by German U-boat U-118 while making a convoy voyage from Liverpool to Philadelphia.

Twenty lives were lost, including that of the ship’s commander and a young able seaman from Wrexham, when it sank about 21 miles (34km) off Tuskar Rock, south-east of Rosslare in Ireland.
