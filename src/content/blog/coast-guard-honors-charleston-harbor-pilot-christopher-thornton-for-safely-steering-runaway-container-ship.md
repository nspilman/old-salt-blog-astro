Rear Adm. Douglas Scholfeld, commander of the Coast Guard 7th District, presents Christopher Thornton of the Charleston Branch Pilots with Meritorious Public Service Award for his actions in safely steering a ship to safety June 5, 2024. Coast Guard photo.

Early last month, we posted about the departure on the morning of June 5th, of the [container ship *MSC Michigan VII*](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2024/06/throttle-stuck-at-full-ahead-on-container-ship-msc-michigan-vii-in-charleston-harbor-bridge-shutdown/) from the North Charleston Container Terminal in Charleston, South Carolina. Its engine was set to “dead slow ahead” as it moved down the Cooper River. Instead of proceeding at a harbor speed of 6 -8 knots, however, the engine increased power to near full-ahead without warning, propelling the ship between 14 and 17  knots, and would not respond to commands.

[For nearly 90 minutes, harbor pilot Christopher Thornton steered the runaway 70,000-ton containership](https://www.workboat.com/coastal-inland-waterways/coast-guard-honors-charleston-pilot-for-steering-runaway-ship) on a slalom course 20 miles along the Cooper River, making five major turns and shooting under the landmark Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge – all at nearly twice the normal speed of ships through the harbor. 

His ship handling maneuvers on June 5 “were nothing short of miraculous and directly saved lives, property, and the marine environment,” according to a [Coast Guard Meritorious Public Service Award](https://www.news.uscg.mil/Press-Releases/Article/3818162/photo-release-coast-guard-presents-charleston-harbor-pilot-with-public-service/) presented June 26 to Thornton at the Charleston Branch Pilots Association station.

“I am truly honored to present Mr. Thornton with this award for his actions in safely piloting the *MSC Michigan VII* out of the Charleston Harbor and to sea,” said Rear Adm. Douglas Schofield, commander of the Coast Guard 7th District. “His immediate action to not only continue piloting the ship effectively but also notify all port partners of the of the ship’s mechanical difficulties was vital in protecting the safety of both property and people in and around the greater Charleston waterways.”
