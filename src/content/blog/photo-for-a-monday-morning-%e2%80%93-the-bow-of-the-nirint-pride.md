Some Monday mornings feel like I was in a head on collision with a containership.  Here is a photo of the bow of the  *Nirit Pride* which did indeed collide earlier this month with the MSC vessel *Nikita* in shipping lanes near Rotterdam*.*

Fortunately no one was seriously injured and both ships returned to port safely with the assistance of salvage tugs.  Quick action by the salvors, Dutch Coast Guard and the Port Authority of Rotterdam prevented what could have have been a disaster as both ships were heavily damaged.
