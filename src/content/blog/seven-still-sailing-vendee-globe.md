![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/02/vendeeglobe7.jpg)One month ago, French sailor, [Armel Le Cléac’h, 39, crossed the finish line at Les Sables d’Olonne](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/01/armel-le-cleach-wins-8th-vendee-globe-singlehanded-round-world-race/), France to win the 8th Vendée Globe. Since then another 10 boats have followed Le Cléac’h across the line. It is a testimony to the enormity of the single-handed around-the-world race that seven of the original 29 to set sail are still racing, in a competition where finishing is a victory in its own right. Even of the original 29 racers withdrew from the race.

The closest of the remaining racers is [Alan Roura](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/84/alan-roura) sailing *La Fabruque,* who is less than 100 nm from the finish, while the farthest is [Sebastien Destremau](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/62/sebastien-destremau) sailing *TechnoFirst – faceOcean,* who has over 3,000 nm to sail. Rich Wilson, sailing *Great American IV,* , [the oldest sailor in the race at 66](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/01/wilson-roura-oldest-youngest-vendee-globe-racers-round-cape-horn/), will in all likelihood be the next to follow Roura across the finish line. Roura is the youngest sailor in the Vendee Globe at 23.

Conrad Colman, sailing *Foresight Natural Energy,* was [dismasted just over a week ago](http://www.sail-world.com/Australia/Vendee-Globe---Foresight-Natural-Energy-dismasted/151684?source=google) but has managed to jury rig a mast using his boom and has kept sailing. He commented, “Never have I worked so hard to go so slowly!”  He should finish just behind Rich Wilson. 

[Didac Costa](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/82/didac-costa) sailing *One Planet One Ocean*, [Romain Attanasio](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/80/romain-attanasio) on *Family Mary – Étamine du Lys*, and [Pieter Heerema](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/83/pieter-heerema) sailing *No Way Back,* round out the remaining racers, spread across the Atlantic from around 800 to 2,000 nm from the finish.
