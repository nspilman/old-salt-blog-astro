Saratov in 2020

In March, we [posted about the sinking](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/03/russian-landing-ship-destroyed-by-ukrainian-attack-in-occupied-port-of-berdyansk/) of a Russian [Alligator Class landing ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapir-class_landing_ship) by a Ukrainian ballistic missile strike in the Ukrainian port city of Berdyansk, which Russia captured in late February. 

The [Russians are now salvaging the landing ship](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62022476). At the time of the attack, the Ukrainians identified the ship as the *Orsk.* It now appears that the ship being salvaged is a sister ship, the *Saratov*.

The 58-year-old *Saratov* joined the Soviet navy in 1964. It can carry up to 20 tanks, or 45 armored personnel carriers, or 50 trucks, as well as up to 400 marines. The ship is 113m (371ft) long and can carry a load of up to 1,500 tonnes.

Berdyansk lies on the Sea of Azov, between the port city of Mariupol and Crimea. Capturing Mariupol, now in ruins after months of bombardment, was a key strategic goal for the Russian military.
