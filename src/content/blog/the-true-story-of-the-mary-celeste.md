The story of the “ghost ship” [*Mary Celeste*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Celeste) is one of the great mysteries of the sea. The merchant brigantine was found 400 miles east of the Azores on December 5, 1872, unmanned and apparently abandoned in fair weather.  What happened to the Captain, his family, and the crew has remained a puzzle. The mystery has been the subject of a range of wild theories and speculation, ranging from mutiny to pirates to sea monsters to killer waterspouts in countless articles and books. Now, with the discovery of a previously overlooked transcript of the *Mary Celeste*‘s log, the answer to the mystery may come down to an inaccurate chronometer and a faulty pump.  Here is a fascinating documentary directed and produced by Anne MacGregor and funded in part by National Geographic, *The True Story of the ‘Mary Celeste.’*  See also [Abandoned Ship: The Mary Celeste](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/abandoned-ship-the-mary-celeste-174488104/).
