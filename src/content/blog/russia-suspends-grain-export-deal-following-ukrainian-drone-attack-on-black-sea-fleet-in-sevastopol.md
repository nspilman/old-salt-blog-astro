![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/10/sevastdrone-attack.jpg)The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63437212) reports that Russia says that Ukraine carried out a “massive” drone attack on Saturday on the Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, damaging one warship. Nine drones were used, a top official said. Unconfirmed sources claim that several of the Russian ships from the fleet were blown up, including the frigate *Admiral Makarov*. A Russian official in Crimea said that the drone attack was repelled, while Ukraine has not commented.

In an apparent response to the drone attack, [Russia announced on Saturday that it is suspending](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/29/1132608672/russia-says-it-is-suspending-a-grain-export-deal-with-ukraine) its participation in a United Nations-brokered deal to secure the export of Ukrainian grain out through the Black Sea. According to Russia’s Foreign Ministry, Moscow is exiting the grain deal for an “undetermined period.”
