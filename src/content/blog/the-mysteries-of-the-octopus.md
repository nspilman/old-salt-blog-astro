This morning’s [CBS Sunday Morning](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-week-on-sunday-morning-january-12-2020/) news program had an intriguing featuring the octopus, in particular, and cephalopods, in general. Both unworldly and highly intelligent they are as close to alien life forms as one can find on the planet. CBS’s Chip Reid visits scientists at New England Aquarium in Boston, and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., and talks with Sy Montgomery, author of “[The Soul of an Octopus](http://symontgomery.com/soul-of-an-octopus/),” about these curious creatures. Well worth watching.
