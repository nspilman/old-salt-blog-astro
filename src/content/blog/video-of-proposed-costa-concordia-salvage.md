Last Friday [we posted about a presentation made by the Titan-Micoperi consortium](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/05/18/titan-micoperi-presents-plan-to-raise-costa-concordia/) detailing their plans to salvage the Costa Concordia from the where she sank on January 13th off the island of Giglio, Italy.  The plan is to build an underwater platform onto which the ship can be rolled. Caissons, air tanks, secured to the sides of the hull would then be used to float the ship.   If successful, the salvage will be the largest re-floating of a sunken ship in history.
