![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/09/piratefest1.jpg)The good folks in Eastport, Maine have seen fit to once again hold their annual [Eastport Pirate Festival](http://www.eastportpiratefestival.com/) this weekend, featuring lots of fun activities including a lobster boat race. (Who knew pirates had lobster boats?)   The [Treasure Coast Pirate Fest](http://www.treasurecoastpiratefest.com/) in historic downtown Stuart, Florida is also being held this weekend.  No lobster boats, but lots of food, music and other activities.   On the West Coast, the [Toshiba Tall Ships Festival](http://www.tallshipsfestival.com/2011/index.html) hosted by the Oceans Institute is being held this weekend at Dana Point.  Not strictly a “pirate festival” the tickets are being sold as “Pirate Adventure Passes.”  Children are invited to attend the “*Friendly Pirate School! Watch as your child learns to talk like a pirate, walk like a pirate and sing like a pirate!*”  
  
As we approach this year’s annual and dreadful ‘Talk Like  Pirate Day’ on the September 19th, I find myself wondering if there isn’t a better way to celebrate our nautical heritage than by dressing as Disney-fied versions of blood-thirsty murderers and thieves.

At the risk of sounding overly grumpy, it is worthwhile to point out that piracy is still with us. In the past few years, several thousands sailors have been held hostage under horrible conditions until ransom was paid for their release.  This year, according to [EU NAVFOR](http://www.eunavfor.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Pirated-vessels.pdf), thirty ships and boats have been hijacked so far and  711 hostages have been taken.  This week [we posted about seven Danes](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/09/07/update-somali-pirates-free-7-danes/), four adults and three children, who were finally released by Somali pirates after being held since their sailboat was hijacked last February.  The cost of piracy to the world economy is estimated to range between $5 and $12 billion per year.  To learn more about what you ca do you help stop real piracy, go to [Save Our Seafarers.](http://www.saveourseafarers.com/#topnav)
