Today, the [Clipper Round The World Yacht Race](https://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/) began from St Katherine’s Docks, London.  Twelve teams are competing in the world’s longest ocean race of 40,000 nautical miles.  While the captains of the twelve boats are all professionals, the 700 crew members from 41 different countries are all amateurs, 40% of the whom never sailed prior to signing up for the race. The race is sailed roughly every two years.  This is the tenth race since the event was founded in 1996 by [Sir Robin Knox-Johnston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Knox-Johnston), who was the first person to sail solo non-stop around the world. Thanks to Phil Leon for contributing to this post.
