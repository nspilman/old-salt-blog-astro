![battlelakeeriebi](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/09/battlelakeeriebi.jpg)Two hundred years ago today, in what would become known as the [Battle of Lake Erie](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/09/the-two-most-important-naval-victories-of-the-war-of-1812-part-1-battle-of-lake-erie/), a squadron of ships under the command of [Oliver Hazard Perry](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/08/oliver-hazard-perry-hero-of-lake-erie-born-and-died-on-august-23rd/) defeated and captured a Royal Navy squadron at Put-in-Bay in Lake Erie off the coast of Ohio.  Last week on Labor Day, there was a reenactment of the battle, the largest naval reenactment ever undertaken in the United States.  (No surprise the Americans won again.) The boats and ships involved in the reenactment had the additional challenge of avoiding the more than 2,000 spectator vessels. The [Battle of Lake Erie Bicentennial](http://battleoflakeerie-bicentennial.com/gallery/photos/battle-re-enactment/) site has a wonderful slide-show of photos taken during the reenactment.  [Click here to view it](http://battleoflakeerie-bicentennial.com/gallery/photos/battle-re-enactment/).

Here is a wonderful 90 second video from the [Plain Dealer](http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2013/09/90-second_know-it-all_the_batt.html) with an animated history of the battle:
