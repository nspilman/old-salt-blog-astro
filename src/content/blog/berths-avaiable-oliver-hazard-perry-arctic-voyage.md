[*Oliver Hazard Perry*](https://www.ohpri.org/ship/) is a 207 feet long, steel hulled, three-masted square-rigged ship and is the largest privately owned tall ship as well as the largest civilian sail training vessel in the United States. It is also the first ocean-going full-rigged ship to be built in the US in over 100 years. She is operated by the non-profit organization [Oliver Hazard Perry Rhode Island](http://www.ohpri.org/).
