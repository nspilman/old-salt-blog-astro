**UPDATE**: Between the effects of the explosion, fire, and water put aboard in firefighting the *Shoko Maru* subsequently sank.

The 2,242 DWT Japanese product tanker, [*Shoko Maru*](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/431400494/vessel:SHOKO_MARU), exploded and caught fire Thursday morning, local time, while anchored about 5 kilometers off the port of Himeji in western Japan.  The ship had recently finished discharging a cargo of heating oil.  Seven of the eight ship’s crew escaped, although four were reported to be seriously burned. The rest were treated for lesser injuries.  One person, reported to be the ship’s 64-year-old captain, is still missing.

It may at first seem counter-intuitive, but an empty tanker is far more likely to explode than a loaded tanker.  While an empty tanker does not contain significant oil, the oil vapors left in the tanks when mixed with oxygen can form an explosive mixture which, if ignited by a spark, can go off like a bomb. There were unconfirmed reports that a [sailor was using a grinder on deck](http://news.yahoo.com/explosion-tanker-off-japan-coast-coastguard-reports-024531101.html) just before the explosion. If this turns out to be accurate, a spark from the grinder may have set off the explosion.

Inert gas is used to prevent such explosions. In most cases, inert exhaust gases are scrubbed and injected into the tanks to displace the oxygen vapor mix. Inert gases from shore can also be used depending on the size of the ship. The requirement to use inert gas systems generally applies only to larger ships than the *Shoko Maru*.  Until recently all new tank ships and most existing tank ships over 20,000 DWT were required to have installed and to use inert gas systems.  Last year, the criteria was lowered to 8,000 DWT, which is still roughly four times larger than the just over 2,000 DWT *Shoko Maru.*
