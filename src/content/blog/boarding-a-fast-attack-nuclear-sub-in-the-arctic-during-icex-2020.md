![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/01/boardingattacksub.jpg)A video for a Sunday afternoon. In March, the US Navy officially commenced Ice Exercise (ICEX) 2020 in the Arctic Ocean with the construction of a temporary ice camp, Camp Seadragon, and the arrival of two US Navy fast-attack submarines. 

Destin Sandlin from the [Smarter Every Day](https://www.smartereveryday.com/) Youtube vlog was allowed to go aboard the USS *Toledo* during ICEX. The video below captures what it is like to board a US Navy fast-attack submarine in the Arctic.

As described on the [NORAD website](https://www.norad.mil/Newsroom/Article/2104840/us-navy-kicks-off-icex-2020-in-arctic-ocean/):  ICEX 2020 is a three-week biennial exercise that offers the Navy the opportunity to assess its operational readiness in the Arctic and train with other services, partner nations, and allies to increase experience in the region, and maintain regional stability while improving capabilities to operate in the Arctic environment.

The Seawolf-class fast-attack submarine [USS *Connecticut*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Connecticut_\(SSN-22\)) (SSN 22) from Bremerton, Washington, and the Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine [USS *Toledo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Toledo_\(SSN-769\)) (SSN 769) from Groton, Connecticut, will conduct multiple Arctic transits, a North Pole surfacing, and other training evolutions during their time in the region.
