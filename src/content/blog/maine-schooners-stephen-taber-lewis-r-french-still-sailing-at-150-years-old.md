The [Maine Windjammer fleet was hit hard by the pandemic](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/07/pandemic-update-most-of-maines-windjammers-not-sailing-in-2020/) last summer. Most of the schooners didn’t sail and those that did offered fewer trips. As things return closer to normal, it is a good time to consider two of the oldest commercial sailing vessels still in service, the schooner [*Stephen Taber*](https://www.stephentaber.com/) and the [*Lewis R. French*](https://schoonerfrench.com/), each celebrating their 150th year.

The *Stephen Taber*, which sails out of Rockland, ME, was built in 1871 in Glenwood Landing, New York for coastal trading. She worked primarily in New York Harbor until 1920 when she was sold to a captain in Maine. 

Her current captain, [Noah Barnes has been at the helm for the last 18 years](https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/local/207/two-maine-schooners-turn-150-remain-the-oldest-vessels-still-in-commercial-use-in-america/97-6f5d95c1-9143-4c6c-a6ac-d50ca6aab0ac). His parents bought *Stephen Taber* when he was just six years old and he grew up sailing in the Penobscot Bay. When his parents were ready to retire, he took up the trade of sailing each season from May to October, taking passengers from around the world to visit the more than a thousand islands that dot the bay.

The *Lewis R. French,* sailing from Camden*,* was launched in April 1871, in Christmas Cove, Maine. She is the last remaining Maine-built schooner of the 1800s. She carried freight; including bricks, lumber, firewood, granite, fish, lime, canning supplies, Christmas trees; until 1973, when she was converted to the passenger trade. The *French* has been named a National Historic Landmark.

[Garth Wells](https://schoonerfrench.com/captain) has served as captain of the *Lewis R. French* for the last 18 years.

Here is a short video about the history and operations of the two schooners.
