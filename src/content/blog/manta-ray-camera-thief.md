*The once-in-a-lifetime encounter between an underwater cameraman and a larceny-minded manta ray is now part of posterity.*

*Travis Matteson was filming a school of mantas when what was described as the biggest fish in the bunch swam by, grabbed his $5,000 Canon 5D Mark II underwater rig and swam away. With the camera still rolling the entire time, the manta then got an opportunity to do its own filming of the underwater neighborhood before dropping the it right below the boat. Camera and diver were subsequently reunited.*
