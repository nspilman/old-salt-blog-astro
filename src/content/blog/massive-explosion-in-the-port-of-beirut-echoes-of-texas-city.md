Port of Beirut Explosion Aftermath

Yesterday, a massive explosion in the port of Beirut, Lebanon killed at least 100 people and injured thousands. The blast destroyed buildings in the port district while the shockwave shattered windows and overturned vehicles across the city. An estimated [300,000 people have been displaced](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion.html) from their homes. With an untold number of people still missing, officials expect that the death toll will rise. 

The force of the explosion was the equivalent to a magnitude 3.5 earthquake and could be heard and felt as far away as Cyprus, about 200 kilometers across the Mediterranean.

While the cause of the explosion is still being investigated, it is believed to have been caused by the ignition of about [2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-05/explosion-beirut-lebanon-ammonium-nitrate-store/12525114) that had been stored in a warehouse at the port since it was confiscated from a cargo ship in 2014. The chemical is used for fertilizer and as an explosive. 

Lebanese President Michel Aoun said it was unacceptable such a large quantity of explosive material was stored in a warehouse for six years without safety measures. He also called for a two-week state of emergency to be declared.

The Beirut explosion is reminiscent of a similar [disaster in the port of Texas City, Texas](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fertilizer-explosion-kills-581-in-texas), near Galveston, in 1947. On April 16, ammonium nitrate was being loaded as fertilizer on the freighter *Grandcamp.*  Smoke was observed from one of the cargo holds after approximately 2,300 tons of the chemical had been loaded. The longshoremen attempted to smother the fire by closing the hatches to deny it oxygen, unaware that because of ammonium nitrate’s chemical composition, it does not require oxygen in order to burn. Not long afterward, the ship exploded. 

*Grandcamp* was literally blown to bits. The ship’s 1.5-ton anchor was found two miles away. The blast was heard for 150 miles. The force of the explosion lifted another ship out of the water. People working at the docks were killed instantly. The blast also set fire to another ship loading fertilizer that would later explode. Five hundred homes were leveled and flaming debris ignited a nearby chemical storage facility.  In all, the Texas City explosions killed 581 people and injured 3,500.
