The Thames sailing barge was a remarkably efficient cargo carrier that lasted well into the 20th century before being replaced by diesel trucks. We have followed the [rebuilding](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/11/01/the-famous-sailing-barge-cambria-reborn/) and the [relaunching](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/03/20/relaunching-of-the-thames-sailing-barge-cambria/) of the [Thames sailing barge *Cambria*](http://www.cambriatrust.org.uk/), which was the last British registered vessel to carry a commercial cargo under sail alone, retiring only in 1970.  Thanks to Søren Nielsen and Doug Mills on Facebook for pointing out a new documentary about Thames sailing barges – [Red Sails by Countrywide Productions](http://www.cwideprods.co.uk/red-sails/).  Additional clips from the documentary are available on their [website](http://www.cwideprods.co.uk/red-sails/).
