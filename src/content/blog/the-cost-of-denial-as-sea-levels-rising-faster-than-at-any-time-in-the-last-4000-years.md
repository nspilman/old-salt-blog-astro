![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sealevelrise2.jpg)In 2012, the [North Carolina state legislature](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/north-carolina-legislature-plays-xerxes-considers-making-sea-level-rise-illegal/) believed it had found the solution to the rising sea levels along its Atlantic coast. They would simply ignore it. They passed a law requiring government planning boards to use predictions of sea level rise based on linear projections from 1900. The increase in sea levels due to climate change would not only be ignored, but it would also be made illegal for land use planning purposes.

Guess what? It didn’t work. In the last five years, at least [27 houses in North Carolina’s Outer Bank](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/07/homes/why-are-homes-collapsing-in-north-carolina)s have collapsed due to coastal erosion, strong storms, and rising sea levels. 18 of these collapses occurred during 2024 and 2025.

And it only gets worse. In 2024, a group of federal, state, and local officials released a report on managing threatened oceanfront structures, which found that [750 of nearly 8,800 oceanfront structures](https://www.theassemblync.com/environment/outer-banks-house-collapses-climate-change/) in North Carolina are at risk of oceanfront erosion. The report acknowledges that the issue “will inevitably worsen considering sea level rise forecasts.” Notably, the report does not mention climate change at all in its 20 pages.

Of course, the problem is not limited to the North Carolina Outer Banks.  [New research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09600-z) by scientists at Rutgers University has determined that sea levels, driven by climate change, are rising faster than at any point in the last 4,000 years.

The report says that while rising seas are a global issue, China faces a “double threat” as its largest and most economically important cities are particularly prone to sinking.

According to [Yucheng Lin, who conducted the research](https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/10/20/sea-levels-are-rising-faster-than-at-any-time-in-the-last-4000-years-heres-why), the study outlines two “major forces” that are driving the acceleration of sea level rise: thermal expansion and melting glaciers.

As climate change increases the temperature of the planet, oceans are absorbing more heat and expanding. At the same time, ice sheets in polar regions are melting at unprecedented rates, adding more water to the oceans.

Although the study focused on China, Lin argues the same lessons can be applied to major cities, including New York, Jakarta, and Manila, which are built on low-lying coastal plains and face similar risks.
