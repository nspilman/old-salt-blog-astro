The [Maritime Museum of San Diego](http://www.sdmaritime.org/) brags that the *[Star of India](http://www.sdmaritime.org/star-of-india/)* is the oldest active sailing ship in the world. This weekend they demonstrated how they can make that claim. The *Star of India*, built at Ramsey Shipyard in the Isle of Man in 1863, went sailing this weekend, along with [HMS *Surprise*](http://www.sdmaritime.org/hms-surprise/) and the *[Californian](http://www.sdmaritime.org/californian/)*.  At 148, the old lady is looking mighty fine.
