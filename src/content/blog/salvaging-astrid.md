At the end of July, [we posted about the sinking of the Dutch sail training ship, *Astrid*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/07/brig-astrid-dutch-sail-training-ship-lost-off-cork-ireland-crew-of-30-rescued/), a 136′ (41.65 M) brig, which ran aground on rocks on the western mouth of Oysterhaven, on the Irish coast, near Cork.  She was recently salvaged by West Cork-based Atlantic Towage and Marine with a 937-tonne floating crane, the Atlas, which lifted the steel brig off the rocks.  The [*Astrid*](http://atseasailtraining.com/177/ships/4/astrid.html) was moved safely to the port of Kinsale where she was placed on a deck barge. A video of the salvage:
