![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/05/ussscorpion.jpg)Last week, the Navy marked the 50th anniversary of the loss of the [Skipjack-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skipjack-class_submarine) nuclear submarine [USS *Scorpion* (SSN 589)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Scorpion_\(SSN-589\)#Theories_about_the_loss) in a private observance at the [Scorpion Memorial on Norfolk Naval Station](http://scorpionfamily.com/?page_id=42).  99 officers and crew died when the submarine sank on May 22, 1968, over 400 miles southwest of the Azores in more than 10,000 feet of water. Exactly how and why the *Scorpion* sank remains a mystery. 

After an extensive search, the wreckage of the submarine was located on Oct. 31, 1968, in more than 10,000 feet of water. Among the [various hypotheses for why the submarine sank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Scorpion_\(SSN-589\)#Theories_about_the_loss) were a hydrogen explosion while charging batteries, the accidental activation or explosion of a torpedo, an attack by the Soviets, and even the malfunction of a trash disposal unit. A seven-panel naval board of inquiry concluded that “the certain cause of the loss of the Scorpion cannot be ascertained.”

The USS *Scorpion* is one of two nuclear submarines the U.S. Navy has lost, the other being USS *Thresher*. 1968 was a bad year for submarines. The USS *Scorpion* was one of four submarines that disappeared that year. The others were the others being the Israeli submarine INS *Dakar*, the French submarine *Minerve* and the Soviet submarine *K-129*.
