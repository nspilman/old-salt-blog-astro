![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/01/leopard_new.jpg)This story is a few days old, but remains strange and disturbing.  The Dutch coaster *Leopard,* carrying a cargo of weapons, was reported to have been hijacked by pirates in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Oman last week, but when a Turkish naval vessel located the ship, there was no sign of the crew of six, nor of the pirates.    A hijacked Taiwanese owned fishing vessel, believed to be being used as a pirate mother ship, was observed heading towards Somalia. There is speculation that the crew was aboard the hijacked fishing vessel.  There is also concern that the crew, two Danes and four Filipinos, may have been killed.  The *Leopard* was carrying a cargo of arms but was apparently abandoned by the pirates, leaving the arms cargo untouched.
