Earlier this week we posted about the “[Boatel at Marina 59″ at New York’s Far Rockaway](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/13/marina-59-far-rockaway-boatel-built-from-the-flotsam-jetsam-of-jamaica-bay/), which sounds like a nice blend of art-project, camping and a floating party.   At the extreme other end of the spectrum is designer Michele Puzzolante’s Solar Floating Resort, which is designed to be part luxury yacht and part luxury hotel suite with dash of submersible thrown in.  Energy self sufficient and non-polluting, with modular construction, it is a very interesting concept design, if, no-doubt, a bit pricier than Rockaway’s recycled boatel accommodations.
