![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/10/gcbsr.jpg)We are a bit late posting about the [2020 Virtual Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race](https://gcbsr.z2systems.com/np/clients/gcbsr/publicFundraiserList.jsp?campaignId=28&&test=true&fbclid=IwAR0_APuFq4PZEOPFCBLSyiirGGoxNFzxyk46UpR04kwYhr8P2dU2AbZEqLg), but there is still time to join in. 

In any normal year, the [Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race](https://gcbsr.org/) attracts dozens of schooners on the Bay, to race from Baltimore down to Norfolk. But 2020 is obviously not a normal year.

This year, they are holding a Virtual Race! And the race is already underway.  Each of the participating schooners has picked a nonprofit partner and is racing to raise as much money as possible for charity. You can participate in the race by choosing a schooner, making a contribution, and sharing this webpage with your family and friends! 100% of gifts will go directly to charity and will help make the Chesapeake Bay region a healthier, stronger, and more beautiful place to live.

Donations of $50 to $249 will receive a Commemorative Face Mask.  Donations of $250 and above will receive a Commemorative “Q” Flag Burgee !!!!

Gifts are considered tax-deductible contributions to the Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race. At the end of the race, GCBSR will contribute 100% of your donation directly to your team’s charitable cause. 

The virtual race began on Wednesday, October 14th, and will end on Saturday, October 17, at 3PM.

The race is being hosted by [The Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race,](https://www.facebook.com/GreatChesapeakeBaySchoonerRace/) [Lady Maryland and Sigsbee: LCF Shipboard Baltimore,](https://www.facebook.com/LadyMaryland.Sigsbee/) and [Tugantine Norfolk Rebel](https://www.facebook.com/Tugantine-Norfolk-Rebel-111651237354659/).
