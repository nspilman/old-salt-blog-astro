![Marco_Polo_Bergen_2010](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/02/Marco_Polo_Bergen_2010.jpg)A unusually large wave killed an 85 year old man and injured a woman in her 70s on the cruise ship [MS *Marco Polo*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Marco_Polo) in the English Channel, as it headed for its home port of Tilbury, in Essex.  Both were airlifted from the ship but the man died later. The *Marco Polo* was returning from a 42 day voyage when it was struck by the massive wave.  The ship sailed from Tilbury on January 5 and is carrying 735, mainly British, passengers and 349 crew.

The latest storm, in a winter of severe storms, struck the UK on Valentine’s Day.  [CNN reports](http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/14/world/europe/uk-weather-flooding/) that nearly 6,000 homes have been inundated along the Thames Valley and elsewhere following England’s wettest January in 2½ centuries. Severe flood warnings are in place along the Thames Valley to the west of London, as well as in southwest and central England.  Some communities in low-lying areas of Somerset, in southwest England, have been under water since December. On Thursday in London, a 49-year-old woman was killed when the car she was driving was hit by debris when a building collapsed. Two other people in the car were injured, though not seriously.  Thanks to Phil Leon for contributing to this post.
