[![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sinkex2021.jpg)The Drive](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/42046/retired-frigate-uss-ingraham-just-got-pummeled-to-death-during-a-huge-navy-exercise) reports that on August 15th, 2021, the U.S. Navy sank the [USS *Ingraham*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Ingraham_\(FFG-61\)) in a  Sinking Exercise (SINKEX) off Hawaii as part of the ongoing and unprecedently [massive Large Scale Exercise 2021](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41787/rare-sight-of-two-supercarriers-docked-in-san-diego-with-their-decks-packed-with-aircraft). Not a whole lot is known about this SINKEX just yet, but multiple types of weapons were involved, including a Super Hornet-launched [AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/40886/cruise-missile-variant-of-jsow-glide-bomb-on-the-chopping-block-in-new-navy-budget-request) (JSOW) and [stealthy Naval Strike Missiles](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/30139/this-image-of-a-naval-strike-missile-launch-shows-a-key-tenet-of-stealth-design) (NSM) launched from the Marine Corps’ [new unmanned ground-based launcher](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/40390/the-marines-new-unmanned-ship-killing-missile-launcher-truck-breaks-cover) vehicles. P-8s were also involved, which *could* mean they [employed AGM-84 Harpoons](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/22575/us-navys-old-anti-ship-missile-to-get-new-tricks-after-scoring-six-for-six-at-rimpac). There are likely a number of other weapons that were fired at the frigate, too, as is [typically the case](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/36077/watch-three-anti-ship-missiles-rip-through-uss-durham-during-rimpac-sinking-exercise) during [SINKEXs](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/22639/this-is-the-only-photo-of-a-u-s-navy-supercarrier-being-sunk), which are prized and infrequent training and developmental opportunities.

The incorporation of the [Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/nmesis.htm) (NMESIS) is a major development for this SINKEX. The system uses an unmanned vehicle based on the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle’s chassis, known as Remotely Operated Ground Unit Expeditionary-Fires (ROGUE-Fires), that carries twin Naval Strike Missile launch canisters. 

USS *Ingraham* was the last vessel in the Oliver Hazard Perry class of guided-missile frigates, which have been used in previous sinking exercises (and have shown considerable resilience). [Maritime Executive](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/photos-us-navy-conducts-live-fire-and-sinking-exercise-in-the-pacific) notes that in an odd quick of history, she was also the second ship of this name to be used in a sinking exercise. The previous USS *Ingraham*, a Sumner-class destroyer built in 1944 and decommissioned in 1971, was sold to the Greek Navy and was sunk as a target in 2001.
