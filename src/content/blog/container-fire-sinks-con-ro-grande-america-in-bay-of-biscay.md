![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/grandeamericafire.jpg)Another container fire has claimed another ship. On Sunday, a fire broke out in a weather-deck container on the roll on/roll off container ship [MV *Grande America*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:283162/mmsi:247594000/imo:9130937/vessel:GRANDE_AMERICA) while in the Bay of Biscay, 150 miles off the French coast. The fire quickly spread to other containers and to vehicles on the ro-ro deck. The captain ordered the crew of 27 to abandon ship. A lifeboat was launched but was damaged in heavy seas. 

Fortunately, [*HMS Argyll*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Argyll_\(F231\)) a Royal Navy ‘Duke’ Class frigate, was in the area and was diverted to rescue *Grande America’s* crew. [The rescue lasted eight hours in rough conditions](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-47524010). The crew were taken to the French port of Brest. Some of the crew required hospitalization, but no life-threatening injuries were reported.

The [French authorities dispatched a Falcon 50 maritime surveillance plane](https://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/272880/italian-conro-ship-catches-fire-off-france-27-people-evacuated/) to the scene. A fire fighting salvage tug attempted to bring the fire under control. Nevertheless, France’s Marine Nationale reported today that *Grande America* sank in the Bay of Biscay in 4,600 meters of water. MV *Grande America* was 28,000 DWT and operated by Grimaldi Group. 

Fires originating in cargo containers are occurring with a disturbing frequency. So far this year, fires in containers have broken out on the [*APL Vancouver*](https://www.fleetmon.com/maritime-news/2019/25085/apl-vancouver-fire-update-video/) in early February off Vietnam and in January on the [*Yantian Express*](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/first-photos-show-fire-damage-to-the-yantian-express-cargo) southeast of Newfoundland, Canada. Fortunately, both fires were brought under control without a loss of life.

The worst recent containership fire was aboard the [*Maersk Honam*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maersk_Honam) a year ago in the Arabian Sea. Five crew were lost and the fire burned for over a month. The bow and accommodations block of the 15,000 TEU ship were so damaged that they were scrapped. A new bow and deckhouse are being fabricated in a Korean shipyard to be attached to the undamaged stern.
