The [National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)](http://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/PR20160824.aspx) announced Wednesday that they had successfully retrieved 26 hours of information from the *El Faro* Voyage Data Recorder (VDR). The VDR was recovered earlier in August in 15,000 feet of water.  The US flagged cargo ship, [*El Faro,* sank during Hurricane Joaquin](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/10/roro-cargo-ship-el-faro-still-missing-with-33-crew-in-hurricane-joaquin/) in October 2015, with the loss of all 33 aboard, northeast of Acklins and Crooked Islands, in the Bahamas.

From the [NTSB  press release](http://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/PR20160824.aspx):

*About 26 hours of information was recovered from the VDR, including bridge audio, weather data and navigational data. Investigators examined the VDR, found it to be in good condition, and downloaded the memory module data in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommended procedures.*

*Numerous events leading up to the loss of the El Faro are heard on the VDR’s audio, recorded from microphones on the ship’s bridge. The quality of the recording is degraded because of high levels of background noise. There are times during the recording when the content of crew discussion is difficult to determine, at other times the content can be determined using audio filtering.*

*The recording began about 5:37 a.m., Sept. 30, 2015 – about 8 hours after the El Faro departed Jacksonville, Florida, with the ship about 150 nautical miles southeast of the city. The bridge audio from the morning of Oct. 1, captured the master and crew discussing their actions regarding flooding and the vessel’s list. The vessel’s loss of propulsion was mentioned on the bridge audio about 6:13 a.m. Also captured was the master speaking on the telephone, notifying shoreside personnel of the vessel’s critical situation, and preparing to abandon ship if necessary. The master ordered abandon ship and sounded the alarm about 7:30 a.m., Oct. 1, 2015. The recording ended about 10 minutes later when the El Faro was about 39 nautical miles northeast of Crooked Island, Bahamas. These times are preliminary and subject to change and final validation by the voyage data recorder group.*

*The VDR group’s technical experts will continue reviewing the entire recording, including crew discussions regarding the weather situation and the operation and condition of the ship*.
