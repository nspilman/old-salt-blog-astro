![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/08/Oosterschelde1.jpg)The Dutch three-masted topsail schooner [*Oosterschelde*](http://www.oosterschelde.nl/ship/?lang=en) will be 100 years old next year, but she is still fast. She just finished [first in the trans-Atlantic race from Halifax to Le Havre](http://www.oosterschelde.nl/2017/08/100-year-old-wins-trans-atlantic-race/?lang=en). After a voyage of 2,500 nautical miles (4,500 km) the ship left all her competitors behind and won the final leg of the [Rendez-Vous 2017 Tall Ships Regatta](http://www.sailtraininginternational.org/events/2017-canada-150-tall-ships-regatta). From their newsletter, Captain Arain reports: “*Warren at the helm when we passed the finish line south of Eddystone lighthouse, off the coast of Plymouth UK at 16:02 UTC. First in class A and overall.* A huge *thanks to the crew!!!*”

*Oosterschelde* was built as a cargo vessel in 1918. The schooner is the last remaining representative of the large fleet of schooners that sailed under the Dutch flag at the beginning of the 20th century. As the largest restored Dutch sailing ship the *Oosterschelde* is a monument for Dutch shipbuilding and maritime navigation under sail.
