[Cheap Fokkers](http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htnavai/20100320.aspx)

*Peru has bought, real cheap, two Dutch maritime reconnaissance aircraft (Fokker 60s).*

*These are slightly longer and heavier versions of the twin engine Fokker 50 (which, in turn, was a larger version of the very popular Fokker F27). Only four Fokker 60s were built, in the 1990s, and all served as military transport aircraft. But six years ago, the Netherlands found itself temporarily short of maritime patrol aircraft. So two of the Fokker 60s were fitted with radar and other equipment, and served for two years as patrol aircraft. Then they were retired. Someone in Peru noted that the aircraft were still in good shape, still had their maritime patrol equipment, and were just sitting there. A deal was made, and the Fokker 60s will be back to work in the east Pacific.*
