![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/08/borkenbulker2.jpg)The Capesize bulk carrier *Wakashio*, which ran hard aground on a reef in Mauritius on July 25, broke in two this Sunday. The bow of the ship has been taken under tow and moved away from the reef. Reports are that the bow section will be [sunk in deep water](https://www.offshore-energy.biz/towing-of-broken-up-wakashio-gets-underway/) although there are [varying accounts as to where](https://usatodaynews.live/1884-stranded-off-the-coast-of-mauritius-the-wakashio-splits-in-two.html). Some accounts suggest the bow will be [taken to India to be scrapped](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/08/18/national/mauritius-ship-japan-relief-team/#.Xz06z-hKhPY).

The cleanup of the approximately 1,000 tons of fuel oil that spilled from the ship’s tanks continues. Experts from France, Japan, and the United Nations are also involved in the clean-up work. The grounding took place off of Pointe d’Esny, near the marine park of Blue Bay. Mauritius is home to world-renowned coral reefs, and tourism is a crucial part of its economy.

The *Wakashio*‘s [Master and Chief Officer have been arrested](https://www.offshore-energy.biz/mauritius-police-arrests-master-chief-officer-of-ill-fated-bulker-wakashio/) by local authorities.  On 18 August, the Mauritius Police Force (MPF) arrested the two men on charges of jeopardizing the safety of navigation, Japanese shipping companies Nagashiki Shipping and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), the ship’s owner and charterer, confirmed.

There are r[eports that the bulk carrier ran aground during a birthday party](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/08/wakashio-grounding-the-birthday-party-the-search-for-wi-fi/) for one of the crew and that the ship’s course was changed to bring it closer to the island in an attempt to pick up a wifi signal.
