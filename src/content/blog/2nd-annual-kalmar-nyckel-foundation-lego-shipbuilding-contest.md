[![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/knlego.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/events/732382473606277/)I do not not immediately associate a replica of a [17th century Dutch pinnace](http://www.kalmarnyckel.org/dy.asp?p=9) with LEGOs, which may only reflect the limits of my imagination.  The [Kalmar Nyckel Foundation](http://www.kalmarnyckel.org/Index.asp) is hosting their [Second Annual LEGO Shipbuilding Contest](https://www.facebook.com/events/732382473606277/). It sounds like a lot of fun. From their [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/732382473606277/): 

*Calling all LEGO enthusiasts and ship builders! On Saturday, March 4th, the Kalmar Nyckel Foundation will host its second annual LEGO Shipbuilding Contest. The free event will offer maritime and LEGO enthusiasts the chance to create replicas of the “Kalmar Nyckel,” other famous vessels like the USS “Maine” and USS “Wisconsin,” or any other creation of their choosing.*

*The event, which will take place from 10 am – 3 pm, is free to all and will have three main categories. First is a “home-build contest,” where competitors can design a ship of their choosing using LEGO pieces from their own collection at home and bring it to the maritime center (these creations go home with contestants). While any ship can be entered, we will also be awarding a special prize for the best re-creation of the Vasa, the Swedish warship.

*A second is the “Maritime Center contest” for those who want to build their own creations at the event using the Kalmar Nyckel Foundation’s LEGOs. Contestants in these categories can win great prizes, which are awarded across several age levels. A third main activity is for those who want to build famous naval vessels from design plans and “dry docks” provided by the Hampton Roads Naval Museum.*

*LEGO fans can also enjoy the “free play” area, where they can let their imaginations run wild by using LEGO pieces provided by the Kalmar Nyckel Foundation. There will be food trucks on-hand for refreshments and additional activities – from face-painting and to a “scupper toss” – to keep the everyone engaged.*

The [Kalmar Nyckel Foundation](http://www.kalmarnyckel.org/Index.asp) is located at 1124 E 7th St, Wilmington, Delaware 19801.
