We posted yesterday about [Sailing for Couch Potatoes](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/28/sailing-for-couch-potatoes-americas-cup-world-series-finale-on-nbc/), or how to watch the America’s Cup Races without leaving your couch.  [NBC, for example,  is broadcasting the America’s Cup World Series Finale](http://www.americascup.com/en/Latest/News/2012/6/Americas-Cup-World-Series-finale-comes-to-NBC/) on Sunday.

The New York Times this morning featured an article describing briefly how the Cup Races are receiving the “television treatment”  including the electronic placement of racing information, including starting lines and way points, live on the televised image of the race itself.  This is similar to how the line of scrimmage and  first-down line magically appear on the televised field during football games. Indeed, Stan Honey, who developed the technology for football, has been hired by the America’s Cup organization.

Oddly, the fancy graphics are not the only aspect of the America’s Cup Races that are reminiscent of professional football.  Given the high speeds of the America’s Cup catamarans, the sailors wear helmets like football players.  The races are also held closer to shore to make it easier for spectators to watch. Watching the races in Newport’s East Passage is not quite like watching a football game in stadium but there are similarities.  And, as noted above, the entire race is being tailored to meet the needs of television.

Here is a wonderful video of the first wild day of sailing off Newport, featuring among other things, Stan Honey’s magic graphics on the water. Thanks to Peter Lane for pointing out the video.
