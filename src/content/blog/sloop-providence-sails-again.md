![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Tall_Ship.jpg)Great news. The Sloop *Providence*, replica of the American Revolutionary sloop of the same name is sailing again after being laid up for 3 1/2 years.   She was purchased last year from the City of Providence by boat builder and captain Thorpe Leeson.   The current Sloop *Providence* dates back to 1976 and has been used in two of the ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ movies. Over the weekends she was sailed from Providence to Newport, Rhode Island and was open for tours on Sunday at Bowen’s Wharf.   The new owners plan to employ the sloop on charters and educational missions.

The original sloop *Providence* was built as the merchant vessel, *Katy*, for John Brown of Providence around 1775.  Under the command of Abraham Whipple, the *Katy* was the first American vessel ship to capture a Royal Navy vessel, the armed sloop *Diana* in June of 1775.  The *Diana* was tender to HMS Rose which was cruising near Narragansett Bay.   Abrahm Whipple was known for his role in the burning of HMS *Gaspee* in 17772.   When he learned of the capture of the *Diana* by Captain Whipple, Captain Sir James Wallace of HMS *Rose* sent Whipple an angry message:

*You, Abraham Whipple, on the 10th of June, 1772, burned His Majesty’s vessel, the Gaspee, and I will hang you at the yard-arm. –James Wallace*

To which, Whipple replied:  *To Sir James Wallace, Sir: Always catch a man before you hang him. –Abraham Whipple*

Whipple was never caught by Wallace and died on the Ohio frontier at the age of 86.

The *Katy* was  taken into the fledgling Colonial Navy and renamed *Providence*.  She was later commanded by John Paul Jones on several successful voyages.   In August 1779, *Providence* was burned, along with other American vessels, to prevent her falling into the hands of the British towards the end of the disastrous [Penobscot Expedition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penobscot_Expedition).
