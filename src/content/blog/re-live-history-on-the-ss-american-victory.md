![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/amvictory.jpg)The waters around Tampa Bay may appear to step back in time tomorrow as the World War II Victory ship *[SS American Victory](http://www.americanvictory.org/)* leaves the dock for her first cruise in nearly three years. The critically acclaimed [“Re-Live History Cruise”](http://www.americanvictory.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Cruise-Flyer1.jpg)  will feature reenactors, WWII airplane fly overs, and historical ceremonies as well as a DJ, live entertainment, and food and drink.

During World War II, 531 [Victory ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_ship) were built in the United States. The *S.S. American Victory* is one of the few ships of her class to have survived.  In addition to serving in the Pacific in the last days of World War II, she also carry food and machinery from the United States to Europe under the Marshall Plan and later would carry military supplies in the Vietnam War.  She has been a museum ship in Tampa, FL since 1999.
