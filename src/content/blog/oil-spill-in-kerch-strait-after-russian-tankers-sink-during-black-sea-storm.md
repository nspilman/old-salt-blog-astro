![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/12/russiantanker.jpg)Authorities in Russia have said two small Russian oil tankers sank or were seriously damaged in the Black Sea on Sunday, resulting in an oil spill in the Kerch Strait.  The two tankers, *Volgoneft-212* and *Volgoneft-239*, each with cargo deadweights of approximately 4,200 tonnes and both [reported to be over 50 years old](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-cargo-ship-carrying-oil-products-distress-kerch-strait-says-emergencies-2024-12-15/), had crews of 15 and 14 people, respectively.

The *Volgoneft-212* broke in half, its bow sinking, spilling its cargo of low-grade residual fuel oil, known as mazut.  Initial reports said that the *Volgoneft-239* was disabled and adrift. Subsequently, the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dq6q0m862o) quoted a statement by Russia’s federal sea and inland water transport agency, Rosmorrechflot, saying that the *Volgoneft-239* had also sunk. Official statements did not provide details on the extent of the spill.

Emergency services said one person had died, but 12 other people had been evacuated from the first tanker. Eleven of those were taken to hospital, with two in serious condition, the TASS news agency quoted Alexei Kuznetsov, an aide to the health minister, as saying.

The Kerch Strait is a key route for exports of Russian grain and is also used for exports of crude oil, fuel oil and liquefied natural gas.
