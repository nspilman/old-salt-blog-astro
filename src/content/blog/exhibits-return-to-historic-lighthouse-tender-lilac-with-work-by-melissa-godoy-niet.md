![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/waterschange.jpg)In addition to being a museum ship as America’s only steam-powered lighthouse tender, the [ex-USCG Cutter *Lilac*](http://www.lilacpreservationproject.org/) serves as a community arts and education space. Unfortunately in the past year, the pandemic temporarily shut these programs down.  Now the exhibitions are restarting, inaugurated with work by Melissa Godoy Nieto.

[*Waters Change, Colors Fade*](http://www.lilacpreservationproject.org/upcoming-exhibition) is an exhibition by Mexican-born multi-media artist [Melissa Godoy Nieto](https://lilacpreservationproject.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2a197f1ae59cfefb2ce14c8be&id=9308917dd0&e=ffd12cef29) drawing on her personal experience observing both the vibrancy of healthy coral reefs and the coral degradation caused by climate change, Godoy Nieto shares an underwater wilderness through drawings, textile collages and installation. 

The artworks in the exhibition are the expression of Godoy Nieto’s exploration of the Great Mayan Reef and, in turn, coastal communities and her connection to her country of origin.  With coral as both immediate subject and metaphor, the works evoke questions around resilience, adaptation, systemic change, mutualism and visibility.  They serve as documentation of a world that is vanishing and the process by which the artist understands loss.  Godoy Nieto also hopes that the works create more awareness of the climate crisis and inspire individuals from all walks of life to take action now.

The artworks will be featured within *Lilac’s* unique spaces, including several site-specific installations and a sound piece by Amedeo Pace.  In addition to the exhibition, which runs from August 19th to October 17th, *Lilac* will host related educational events.  The [exhibition and events](https://lilacpreservationproject.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2a197f1ae59cfefb2ce14c8be&id=5dd57055fa&e=ffd12cef29) are free and open to the public and are presented by [MW Projects](https://lilacpreservationproject.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2a197f1ae59cfefb2ce14c8be&id=e53441acaf&e=ffd12cef29). Works have been hung to facilitate social distancing while viewing. Capacity at the opening reception on Thursday, August 19 and other events is limited and [reservations](https://lilacpreservationproject.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2a197f1ae59cfefb2ce14c8be&id=bdf1c3ee10&e=ffd12cef29) are requested. Masks are required and can be provided.
