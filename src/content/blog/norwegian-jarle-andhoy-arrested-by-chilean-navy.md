![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/andhoy.jpg)Norwegian rogue adventurer [Jarle Andhøy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarle_Andh%C3%B8y), 34, along with four other crew members on the [54-foot yacht,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/28/jarle-andhoy/) *[Nilaya](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/28/jarle-andhoy/)* have been arrested by the Chilean Navy.  Andhøy is returning from his second Antarctic voyage, both of which he has undertook without permission, permits or insurance.

His first voyage ended in the [sinking of the yacht](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/25/off-antarctica-hope-fades-for-crew-of-yacht-berserk-ii/) *[Berserk II](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/25/off-antarctica-hope-fades-for-crew-of-yacht-berserk-ii/)* and the loss of three crew.  The navy has offered no reason about why the boat was stopped, but Andhoy has been told it was at the request of the New Zealand government.  Andhøy is best known for controversial voyages in polar regions usually without permits, or insurance, which have run afoul of the authorities in Norway, Finland, Russia and New Zealand. He was deported from Canada in 2007.
