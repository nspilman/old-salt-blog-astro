A Whale

Unfortunately, the story is not that unusual. A ship owner in financial trouble and sailors find themselves abandoned on a ship, far from home, with no wages, and running out of food and fuel.  This is what has happened to [21 seafarers stranded on the ore/oiler *A Whale*](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/14-indian-sailors-on-stranded-liberianagged-ship-in-gulf-of-suez/article4860945.ece), a Liberian-flagged ship in the Gulf of Suez. They have been stuck for six months after the vessel suffered a technical breakdown. The ore-oiler, *A Whale*, is owned by TMT group which last week filed for bankruptcy protection in a court in Houston.

This is not the first time that *A Whale* is in the news.  Just three years ago during the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, [we posted about](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=skimmer+a+whale) *[A Whale](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=skimmer+a+whale)*. The ship was brand new and specially modified to skim up to 500,000 barrels of oil-contaminated water a day.   [*A Whale* was offered as the world’s largest oil skimmer.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/a-whale-worlds-largest-oil-skimmer-waiting-on-epa-and-coast-guard-approval/)  *A Whale* would revolutionize offshore oil skimming, if it had worked, which it didn’t.  [It didn’t skim oil.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/skimmer-a-whale-fails-second-round-of-testing/)   Now it is the home for 21 abandoned seafarers owned wages by a bankrupt company, and lacking the basics of food and fuel.  Thanks to Phil Leon for passing along the news.
