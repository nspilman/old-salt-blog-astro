The Liberian flagged container ship, [MV *Rena*](http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Rena-8806802.html;jsessionid=607a020956ea8846b43a93b637ac), ran aground on the Astrolabe Reef off Tauranga, New Zealand yesterday, flooding two cargo holds.   The ship is loaded with approximately 2,100 containers and has around 1,700 tonnes of heavy fuel.  There has been no spillage of the heavy fuel. Hydraulic oil was reported to have leaked and to have created a visible sheen on the water but was dissipating. The crew of 23 have remained aboard the ship. The ship has developed a 10 degree list but is stable on the reef.
