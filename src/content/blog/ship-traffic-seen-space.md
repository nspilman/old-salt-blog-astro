Here is an animation of global ship traffic as seen from space. Mesmerizing and beautiful.

[Global ship traffic seen from space – FleetMon Satellite AIS and FleetMon Explorer](https://youtu.be/CP-TcDtSFDI)

Two thoughts immediately come to mind. The first is that ships and the people who operate them are what keep this misnamed planet working. Ships are the connective tissue of our civilization.

The second thought that came to mind is that those who have been arguing for [turning ships into drones by replacing captains and crews](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/09/crewless-drone-ships-will-be-sailing-the-seas-by-2020/) with electronics and machinery do not understand what they are suggesting. Most argue that it would save money, as no doubt it would, as long as the machinery and electronics always function as intended. We all know how well that works. Some have even gone as far as to claim that drone ships would make the seas safer as if remote captains on dry land operating ships from the equivalent of a video game console would do a better job than a master on the bridge of a ship. Watch the traffic in the Strait of Malacca and then imagine moving all the deck officers and engineers to some sort of corporate video arcade.

Fortunately, we are not in a world where sailors have been driven from the seas, at least no yet. In the meantime perhaps it is enough to watch the world and the ships go ’round.
