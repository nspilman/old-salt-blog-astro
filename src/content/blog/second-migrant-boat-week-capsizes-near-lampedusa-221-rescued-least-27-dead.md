![map-lampedusa-italy](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/10/map-lampedusa-italy.jpg)For the second time in roughly a week, a smuggler’s boat overloaded with migrants from Africa has capsized in the Mediterranean off Sicily, near the island of Lampedusa.  At least 27 died, but 221 were rescued from the water.  The boat capsized 65 miles (105 kilometers) southeast of Lampedusa.

As [we posted last Friday](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/10/familiar-tragedy-least-130-dead-200-missing-lampedusa/), another migrant boat sank last week in which 155 survived. The [death toll from the previous sinking has risen to 232](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24436779) with more than a hundred still missing.  An estimated 6,500 have died off Sicily attempting to flee from Africa between 2004 and 2013.
