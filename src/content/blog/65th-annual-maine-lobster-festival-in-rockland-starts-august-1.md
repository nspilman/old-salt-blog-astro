One of the cuter varieties of lobster

As far as I am concerned, there are few things, that you can do with your clothes on, that are more enjoyable than sitting on the Maine coast and eating freshly steamed lobster. This Wednesday, August 1st, kicks off five days of feasting and fun on the fabulous Maine coast.  The 65th Annual Maine Lobster Festival will be held in Rockland’s Harbor Park from August 1- 5.  There will arts & crafts, music, kid’s activities, a lobster crate race, the Big Parade and the 2012 Sea Goddess Coronation.  And there will be lobster.  No shortage of lobster.
