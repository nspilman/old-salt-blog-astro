A few days ago, a trailer was posted on the internet for a four part documentary television series called, “[No Ordinary Women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEdhEdkQ7qk).”   The voice over for the trailer begins, “‘*No Ordinary Women’ is the story about eleven women ready to do something that has never been done before. They will sail around the world in the [Volvo Ocean Race,](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/home.html) the toughest race there is*.”

The only problem is that the voice-over implies that eleven women sailing around the world in the Volvo Ocean Race is “something that has never been done before.”  The same theme has been picked up in other media sources. [The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/sailing/9489839/Volvo-Ocean-Race-due-to-start-from-Alicante-in-2014-to-feature-all-female-crew.html) comments: “*Ladies first: for the first time the Volvo Ocean race will have an all-female crew.*” It makes for good copy, but simply isn’t true. The eleven women sailing for [TeamSCA](http://www.teamsca.com/) will be the third boat in the race with an all female crew.

[Tracy Edwards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Edwards) skippered the first all female team on the yacht *Maiden* in the [1989-1990 Whitbread Round the World Race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989%E2%80%9390_Whitbread_Round_the_World_Race).   [Edwards is now attempting to raise money to restore Maiden](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2656384/Skipper-female-crew-complete-round-world-yacht-race-answers-SOS-call-rescue-boat-rotting-island-Indian-Ocean.html), on the twenty fifth anniversary of the historic race.

[Volvo took over the Whitbread Race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_Ocean_Race) in 2001.  In the first race under new ownership, [Lisa McDonald](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/sailing/volvo-ocean-race/9115564/Volvo-Ocean-Race-how-women-have-historicially-shaped-the-nine-month-round-the-world-race.html) lead the all-female [Amerisport Too team](http://www.yachtracing.com/richroberts/amerwomen020102.html).  The Amerisport Too was one of the last boats in the water prior to the race and suffered mechanical failures including dismastings, yet the team finished the race and won [several awards for seamanship](http://www.sail-world.com/USA/Amer-Sports-Too-wins-Volvo-Award/6433).

The is a certain paradox in hyping “No Ordinary Women” as “eleven women ready to do something that has never been done before.”  While meaning no disrespect for the eleven female professional sailors in TeamSCA, this sort of hyperbole ignores the real accomplishments of the women sailors who have gone before.

In addition to Tracy Edwards and Lisa McDonald and their crews, who did indeed compete successfully in the Volvo and it predecessor races, there are many incredibly impressive women sailors who should not be forgotten or shunted aside by the marketing for the Volvo Race.

The list is remarkably long. For example, in 2005, [Ellen MacArthur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_MacArthur)  broke the world record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe.  There is also [Dee Caffari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_Caffari) who, in 2006, became the first woman to sail single-handedly and non-stop around the world “the wrong way”; westward against the prevailing winds and currents. In February 2009, Caffari completed the [Vendée Globe race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vend%C3%A9e_Globe) and set a new record to become the first woman to sail solo, non-stop, around the world in both directions.

Also deserving recognition are the Olympians [Shirley Robertson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Robertson), [Pippa Wilson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippa_Wilson), and [Sarah Ayton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Ayton); the ocean racers [Clare Francis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Francis), [Sam Davies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Davies), [Emma Richards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Richards_\(yachtswoman\)), and [Dawn Riley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Riley); and the singlehanders [Krystyna Chojnowska- Liskiewicz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krystyna_Chojnowska-Liskiewicz),  [Naomi James](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Naomi_James), [Laura Dekker,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Dekker) [Jeanne Socrates](http://www.svnereida.com/), and [Kay Cottee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Cottee) .  This list is by no means complete, but you get the point.

A certain amount of hype is understandable in marketing an international yacht race, sponsored by corporate giants. Nevertheless, we should not ignore history. The no-doubt remarkable women sailing in the Volvo Race for the Swedish hygiene and forest products company, SCA, are not the first to do so, and hopefully neither will they be the last.

According to the TeamSCA  [website](http://www.teamsca.com/), “*The TV series “No Ordinary Women” is due to debut Sunday, July 20, on 7TWO in Australia and YLE in Finland. The series will continue to run on premier networks in 30 markets globally throughout 2014 and into 2015.*“
