The [container/ro-ro ship *Jolly Nero*](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=247170400)  slammed into the port control tower in Genoa, Italy on Tuesday night around 11PM, destroying the 165 ft-tall cement tower and killing at least seven.  Four people were reported to be injured  and at least two are still missing.  The 31,000 DWT Italian flag ship was being escorted by two tugs and had a pilot aboard in clear and calm weather at the time of the allision.  There are reports of mechanical failure aboard the ship that interfered with steering of the ship. The [port of Genoa](http://www.porto.genova.it/index.php/en/the-genoa-port) port, on Italy’s western Ligurian coast, is Italy’s largest commercial port. Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) and Phil Leon for contributing to this post.
