BigLift Baffin sailing from Cobh, Ireland

Three megamax container cranes have arrived in the Port of New York and New Jersey on the Netherlands-flagged [heavy-lift ship *BigLift Baffin*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:4500782/mmsi:244830814/imo:9758557/vessel:BIGLIFT_BAFFIN). They will be offloaded and installed at the Maher Terminals in Elizabeth, New Jersey. 

The [new cranes](https://www.projectcargojournal.com/shipping/2022/09/05/biglift-baffin-arrives-in-new-jersey-with-megamax-sts-container-cranes/?gdpr=accept), built by the [Liebherr Group in Killarney, Ireland](https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/about-liebherr/liebherr-worldwide/ireland/killarney/killarney.html), are among the largest in the world. With a height of 150 meters, an outreach of above 53 meters, and a lift height of over 40 meters, the cranes each have a safe lifting load of 40-50 tonnes in single operations, 65 tonnes in twin operations, and 100 tonnes in tandem.

In addition to their impressive capacity, these cranes are designed to be lighter, relatively, which reduces power consumption. Also, the cranes generate electricity during the lowering process, which they then return to the grid.
