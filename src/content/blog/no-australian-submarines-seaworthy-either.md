![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/06/RAN_subgroup_crest.gif)Last week [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/10/and-then-there-were-none-hmcs-corner-brook-accident-leaves-canada-without-operational-subs/) that the Canadian submarine force’s four vessels were all out of service. Apparently  the  Canadians are not alone in this regard, as the Australian fleet of six submarines also is in no shape to put to sea, as reported by the the [Australian](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/not-a-single-submarine-seaworthy/story-fn59niix-1226072631716).

*FOR the first time in a generation, Australia does not have a single submarine available to defend the nation today.*

*The Australian understands the entire fleet of six Collins-class submarines cannot be put to sea despite the navy’s claim that two of them remain officially “operational”.*

*The situation is so dire the navy is believed to have deferred major scheduled maintenance work on its most seaworthy submarine, HMAS Waller, in the hope that at least one submarine will be available in the coming weeks.*

*Not having a single task-ready submarine is an embarrassment for the navy, whose attempts to improve the performance of the $10 billion fleet have been stymied by breakdowns, accidents and the growing unreliability of the ageing vessels.*

*The navy claims two of its submarines, HMAS Waller and HMAS Dechaineux, are available, but insiders say the reality is that neither vessel could be put to sea today if required because each is undergoing detailed inspections for mechanical problems.*

*HMAS Dechaineux is in dock at HMAS Stirling in Perth for an intrusive inspection of its main motor after limping home from Singapore, where defects were found in its propulsion system.*
