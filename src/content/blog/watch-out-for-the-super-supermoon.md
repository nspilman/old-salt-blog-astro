This evening, watch out for the supermoon; well actually, a super supermoon, which on the East Coast of the United States should be rising in the East around sunset.  As reported by [USA today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/06/21/supermoon-full-moon-saturday/2446079/):

*A supermoon occurs when the moon is slightly closer to Earth than it typically is, and the effect is most noticeable when it occurs at the same time as a full moon, according to James Garvin, chief scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.*

*This full moon is not only the closest and largest full moon of the year, according to astronomy website EarthSky. It’s also the moon’s closest encounter with Earth in all of 2013. So it’s not just a supermoon — it’s the closest supermoon of the half-dozen or so that will occur this year, EarthSky reports.*
