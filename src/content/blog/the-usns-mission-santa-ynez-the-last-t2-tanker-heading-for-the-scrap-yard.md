*The last T-2 tanker, in the world is on the way to its final resting place. The USNS Mission Santa Ynez is a Type T2-SE-A2 tanker, of the Mission Buenaventura Class. She has been laid-up in the mothball fleet of Suisun Bay, CA since 1975, and in a few days will be departing the San Francisco drydock for her final voyage to Brownsville, TX for scrapping, under tow through the Panama Canal.*
