A quick quiz.  Is Kick ’em Jenny a rockbilly singer, a Dutch Celtic Symfo-Folk band or an active submarine volcano on the floor of the Caribbean Sea?  The answer appears to be yes to all three.

[Kick ’em Jenny](http://www.myspace.com/kickemjenny) is a Dutch rockabilly singer who performs with the Real Deal.  [Kick ’em Jenny](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kick-em-Jenny/62139509979?v=info) is also a Dutch Celtic Symfo-Folk band.  (One can only hope that the rockabilly and Celtic Symfo-Folk bands don’t get double-booked.)  [KIck ‘Em Jenny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick-'em-Jenny) is also an active  submarine volcano in the Eastern Caribbean.   The [Caribbean Yacht Charter Blog](http://www.visailing.com/blog/?p=1342) recently posted about the volcano – “[The Caribbean May Soon Have a New Island](http://www.visailing.com/blog/?p=1342).”   The word “soon” may be a bit optimistic, unless one is thinking in geological terms.  
  
Kick ’em Jenny is located approximately 8km north of Grenada and is approximately 180m underwater.  Being over 500 feet underwater there isn’t much to see. Its location indicated by the red arrow above.   The volcano was first reported in an eruption in 1939.  The last eruption was in 2001.  Seismic activity in the area has been reported since 1867.

*“On November 18, 1867 five o’clock in the afternoon, the water in the harbor dropped five feet. The reef in front of the lagoon was exposed. Then the water in the harbor rose quickly to four feet over normal height and rushed up to the head of the Carenage. This happened three or four times. Much damage was done to boats and buildings but fortunately no lives were lost.”*  [This Is Grenada by Frances Kay, © 1971,](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BYEKQY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B001BYEKQY)

Some researchers have estimated that Kick ’em Jenny may rise above the surface by early in the next century.   Nevertheless, the most recent surveys performed in 2003 and 2004 suggest that the volcano has not gotten any closer to the surface in the last 40 years.  Then again, it is best not to ignore an active volcano.
