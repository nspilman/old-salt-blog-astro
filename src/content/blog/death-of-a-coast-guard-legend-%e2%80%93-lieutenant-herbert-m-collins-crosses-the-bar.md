*A Coast Guard Legend passed away yesterday. Lieutenant Herbert M.

Here is the message that Admiral Allen sent out to notify the field.*

*Subj: Death of a distinguished CG Veteran*  
  
*It is with deep regret that I announce the passing of Lieutenant Herbert M. Collins, USCG (REt.), a legendary Coast Guardsman and the last surviving crewmember of the all-African American Pea Island Life Saving Station. Lieutenant Collins succumbed to cancer on Sunday evening, March 14th, surrounded by family and friends.*

*Lieutenant Collins service to the Coast Guard and our nation alone is significant, especially in light of the challenges that African Americans faced as the service was integrated. Yet his legacy runs even deeper in our collectie heritage as he was alos the grand nephew of Dorman Pugh, one of seven Gold Life Saving Medal recipients form the Pea Island Rescue of the crew of the stricken schooner E.S. Newman in 1896. When Lieutenant Collins retired in 1976, he and his family set the bar for the longest continuous family service inthe Coast Guard, a record that began with his grandfather, Joseph H. Berry, in 1880.*

*Born in 1921 in Manteo, North Carolina, Lieutenant Collins enlisted in the Coast Guard and attended boot camp in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. First assigned to the Cutter Tallapoosa in Savannah, Collins served as a Mess Attendant. He then served at stations from Florida to Virginia, including aboard cutter Mendota in Norfolk, Virginia, alongside renowned author and Coast Guardsman, Alex Haley. Lieutenant Collins then transferred to the all-African American Life Saving Station at Pea Island where he served as a Surfman for the duration of World War Ii. He and his fellow Surfmen carried out vial search and resuce responsibilities and responded to a distressed shio that had been hit by a torpedo between Pea Island and Chicamacomico Coast Guard Sations. In 1947 Lieutenant Collins ended an historic era in Coast Guard history as he handed over the keys when the Pea Island Station was decomissioned. He later received his commission and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant before retiring in 1976.*
