![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/shipwreck-greece2.jpg)We recently [posted about an overloaded fishing boat](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2023/06/overloaded-migrant-boat-sinks-near-greece-at-least-78-dead-hundreds-feared-drowned/) carrying migrants that capsized and sank early on Wednesday morning in deep waters about 50 miles (80 km) from the southern Greek coastal town of Pylos. The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65942426) reports on evidence casting doubt on the Greek coastguard’s account of the migrant shipwreck in which hundreds are feared to have died.

Analysis of the movement of other ships in the area suggests the overcrowded fishing vessel was not moving for at least seven hours before it capsized.

The coastguard still claims that during these hours the boat was on a course to Italy and not in need of rescue. Greek authorities have not yet responded to the BBC’s findings.

At least 78 people are known to have died, but the UN says up to 500 are still missing.

The UN has called for an investigation into Greece’s handling of the disaster, amid claims more action should have been taken earlier to initiate a full-scale rescue attempt.

The BBC video below explains in more detail what they believe to have transpired.
