HMS INVINCIBLE

The holiday shopping season is in full swing. But what can you get for the person who has everything? Why not a used aircraft carrier? Just because the Royal Navy won’t be able to launch ship-borne fixed wing aircraft for the next decade doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be able to!

*[HMS Invincible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Invincible_\(R05\))* is for [sale by tender](http://www.edisposals.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/Disposals-Public-Site/en_US/-/GBP/ViewProductDetail-Start;pgid=MieqQ4wkQg8000ArvQ_8K1sp0000IeTHb80d?ProductUUID=38jAqBIQwVwAAAEsaApaBWLN&CatalogCategoryID=VaLAqBELPagAAAED8GeasfoP&JumpTo=OfferList).  Admittedly the ship is a bit of a fixer-upper. She is almost thirty years old and her generators and pumps are described as generally unserviceable or not working.  The most likely buyers are steel scrap yards.  The ship may be seen by appointment only between 29th Nov 2010 and 10th Dec 2010. Bids are due by 10:00am Wednesday, January 5, 2011.

[Sale by Tender – HMS Invincible](http://www.edisposals.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/Disposals-Public-Site/en_US/-/GBP/ViewProductDetail-Start;pgid=MieqQ4wkQg8000ArvQ_8K1sp0000IeTHb80d?ProductUUID=38jAqBIQwVwAAAEsaApaBWLN&CatalogCategoryID=VaLAqBELPagAAAED8GeasfoP&JumpTo=OfferList)  
  
It is with considerable trepidation that we make this post.  Early in the life of this blog we posted about three small British warships for sale.  We were not in any way involved in the sale, we were just reporting that it was taking place. Nevertheless, to this day we still still receive inquiries from interested parties wishing to buy the ships.  For the record, we at the Old Salt Blog are not involved directly indirectly or otherwise,  in the sale of *[HMS Invincible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Invincible_\(R05\))* or any other ships for that matter.

Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for passing the news along.   To our knowledge, he doesn’t have any ships for sale either.
