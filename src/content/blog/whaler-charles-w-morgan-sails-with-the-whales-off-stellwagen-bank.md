What a wonderful juxtaposition. The whaling ship [*Charles W. Morgan*](http://www.mysticseaport.org/38thvoyage/), built in 1841, and recently rebuilt by the [Mystic Seaport Museum](http://www.mysticseaport.org/), sailing with humpback whales as they migrate across Stellwagen Bank off Massachusetts. No harpoons were in evidence and the whales did not seem threatened in the slightest by one of the more successful whale ships of her day.
