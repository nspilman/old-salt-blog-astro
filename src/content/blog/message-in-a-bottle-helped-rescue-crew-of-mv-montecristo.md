The current recommended response on a merchant ship on being boarded by pirates is to radio a distress call,  disable the ship’s engines and to retreat into a “citadel,” a safe locked-down space aboard the ship and await either rescue or until the pirates simply give up and go away.   That is exactly what the officers and crew of the [MV *Montecristo* did when boarded by pirates last week.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/11/crew-of-mv-montecristo-rescued-from-pirates-by-nato/)

Once they retreated to the citadel, however, they apparently lacked a means to communicate with their NATO rescuers. Whether they neglected to bring portable radios or batteries into the citadel is not clear. Lacking all else, they relied on a more traditional means of communication – they stuffed a message in a bottle, stuck a flashing beacon on top and threw the bottle out a port hole into the sea. When NATO forces retrieved the bottle and learned that the crew was safe and secure behind locked doors, they launched a raid on the ship and captured the pirates.
