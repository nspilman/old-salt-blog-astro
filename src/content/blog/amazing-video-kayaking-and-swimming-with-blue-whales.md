I have kayaked with killer whales. It was many years ago and the memories are still vivid.  I can only imagine how awe inspiring it must be to kayak next to a [blue whale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale), the largest creature ever to live on the face of the earth.   Here is an amazing video of a kayaker wearing a [Go-Pro helmet cam](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&x=0&ref_=nb_sb_noss&y=0&field-keywords=go%20pro&url=search-alias%3Delectronics&_encoding=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957) paddling next to feeding blue whales off Redondo Beach, California.  The kayaker also jumps off his kayak and swims underwater with the whales. Some amazing video. Thanks to Irwin Bryan for passing it along.
