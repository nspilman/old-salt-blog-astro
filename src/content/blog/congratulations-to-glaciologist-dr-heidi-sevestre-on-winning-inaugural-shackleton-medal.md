![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/shackletonmedal.jpg)Congratulations to glaciologist [Dr. Heïdi Sevestre](https://www.heidisevestre.com/) on winning the inaugural [Shackleton Medal for the Protection of the Polar Regions](https://shackleton.com/pages/shackleton-medal). Dr. Sevestre, a pioneering climate activist, expedition leader, scientific researcher, documentary maker, and lobbyist, receives a prize of £10,000 as a contribution towards her ongoing work in the polar regions and the very first Shackleton Medal.

An international jury of polar experts – chaired by Prof. Lewis Dartnell – debated the shortlist and decided the winner at the Royal Geographical Society in London. 

  
Amongst an exceptionally strong list of nominees, Dr. Sevestre stood out for the extraordinary courage she has demonstrated working in the field and her drive and determination to communicate her message.

Dr. Sevestre is a rising star of the polar world. In the seven years since she obtained her PhD from the University of Oslo she has become a consultant for the Arctic Council, was Director of Outreach for the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative before her job at AMAP, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment  Programme, Working Group to the Arctic Council and has presented numerous scientific documentaries. The jury were particularly impressed with her achievements as an expedition leader in extreme environments, and her extensive outreach campaigns. These have involved giving talks at schools, at universities, on glaciers and even spinning icebergs, with audiences ranging from six-year-old children to CEOs and leading politicians. She is also passionate about the use of social media to educate the world, “I think scientists should be on TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter,’ she declares.
