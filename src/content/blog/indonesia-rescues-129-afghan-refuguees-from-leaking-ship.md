The Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency received a distress call Sunday night from the captain of a wooden ship bound for Australia.  The ship was taking on water and carrying 120 Afghan refugees.  The Afghans were picked up and taken by tanker to a port on the western side of Indonesia’s Java Island.  Refugees without legal documents are usually deported home while others may apply for asylum.

These refugees were far luckier than those on a ship ship last December which sank killing at least 200 asylum seekers, many from Afghanistan.
