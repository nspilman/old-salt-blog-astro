![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/01/ebls-1.jpg)The [East Bay Light Station Bed and Breakfast Inn](https://ebls.org/), at the entrance to San Pablo Bay from San Francisco Bay, is looking to hire two innkeepers for a period of two years. The joint positions, which start in April of this year, come with some very specific requirements.

From the [EBLS website](https://ebls.org/about/keepers-search-innkeeper/):

### Who Should Apply

*The successful candidates will be a couple, one of whom must possess a Coast Guard Merchant Mariner Credential NMC boat operator’s license. They will operate the five-room inn, serving both dinner and breakfast, as well as providing ferry service for guests and all other tasks from chef to the maid.*

*High-quality culinary experience and capability are critical qualifications.*

### Start Date and Compensation

*The inn is open four days a week, and the island is also available for day use and special events. The new keepers will start April 2023 allowing two weeks for training.*

*Compensation is a function of the level of business, occupancy level, and economy. In the last two years, it has averaged $140,000, trending upward, for the couple. Compensation includes a health plan and living quarters on the island.*

The [lighthouse was built in 1874 and automated in 1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Brother_Island_Light). The former keeper’s house began operating as a bed and breakfast in 1980.

Tiffany Danse and Tyler Waterson, two former innkeepers, estimate [they worked about 80 to 90 hours a week maintaining the island](https://www.businessinsider.com/wanted-two-lighthouse-keepers-for-tiny-island-in-san-francisco-bay-2022-12) between 2019 and 2021.
