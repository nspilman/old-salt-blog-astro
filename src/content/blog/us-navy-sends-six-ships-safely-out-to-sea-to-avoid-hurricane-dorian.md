USS Shamal

The US Navy is sending six ships from the Naval Station Mayport in Jacksonville, Florida into the Atlantic in an attempt to get out of the path of Hurricane Dorian, which is expected to strengthen to a category 3 and possibly a Category 4 hurricane before making landfall in Florida. 

The patrol ship USS *Shamal* (PC 13) got underway on Thursday, and the destroyers USS *Lassen* (DDG 82), USS *Paul Ignatius* (DDG 117), USS F*arragut* (DDG 99) as well as the Littoral Combat Ships USS *Billings* (LCS 15), and USS *Milwaukee* (LCS 15), got underway from NS Mayport on Friday.

Not all naval vessels will be leaving Mayport. Some ships will be staying due to their maintenance status. USS *Fort McHenry* (LSD 43), USS *Roosevelt* (DDG 80), USS *Detroit* (LCS 7), USS *Little Rock* (LCS 9), USS *Hue City* (CG 66), USS *The Sullivans* (DDG 68), USS *Thomas Hudner* (DDG 116) and USS *Iwo Jima* (LHD 7) will shelter in place in the Mayport basin and will take precautions to avoid damage.

“Our top priority must always be the safety and security of our ships and aircraft, as well as our Sailors and families. We move our ships and aircraft in order to mitigate potential damage,” Rear Adm. Don D. Gabrielson said in a [statement](https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=110732&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=100000875087481&utm_campaign=Misc). “When maintenance status prevents storm avoidance, we take extra precautions to best protect these units.”
