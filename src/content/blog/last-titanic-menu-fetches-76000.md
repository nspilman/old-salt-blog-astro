*The menu was on the table of the first-class passenger Dr Washington Dodge, a prominent banker from San Francisco who was with his wife and son. The letter had been in Ruth Dodge’s purse when she escaped on board a lifeboat. She and her son survived the tragedy.*

*Other items sold at the auction included a set of keys for the storeroom where the ship’s lifeboat lanterns were kept. The keys, which were used by crewman Samuel Hemming, sold for £59,000 to an American collector.*
