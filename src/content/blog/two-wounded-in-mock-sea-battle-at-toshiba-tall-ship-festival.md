On Saturday, a passenger and a crew member on the schooner *[Bill of Rights](http://americantallship.com/index.php/history/bill-of-rights)* were wounded by bird shot apparently fired from the topsail schooner *[Amazing Grace](http://www.amazinggracetallship.com/)* during a mock sea battle at the [Tobisha Tall Ship Festival](http://tallshipsfestival.com/) at Dana Point, CA.  Neither the passenger or crew member were seriously injured.

“Battle cruises,” or mock sea battle where tall ships fire their guns at each other are very popular of the tall ship circuit. But where do the ships get their powder? Apparently, in this case at least, from 12 gauge shotgun shells which are fired from their small deck guns.  Unfortunately the blank shells, containing powder but without pellets, look quite it a bit like the shells with pellets. The incident is being investigated as an accident.
