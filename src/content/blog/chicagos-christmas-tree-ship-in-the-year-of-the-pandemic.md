![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/christmastreeship2020.jpg)Every year, the [Christmas Ship](http://christmasship.org/), with the support of the US Coast Guard and volunteer groups, delivers Christmas trees to families in need in Chicago’s communities. This year was no exception, but because of the pandemic, it was a bit different.

In past years, the [USCG Cutter *Mackinaw*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Mackinaw_\(WLBB-30\)) delivered trees to the Navy pier where volunteers, including Sea Cadets, Venture Crews, Sea Scouts, and Young Marines, off-loaded the trees and loaded them into trucks to be distributed to more than one thousand deserving families.

This year, the Navy Pier is closed to the public and volunteers could not get to the cutter. Nevertheless, in early December, the [Cutter *Mackinaw* arrived with 1,200 Christmas trees](https://abc7chicago.com/community-events/coast-guard-delivers-christmas-trees-to-navy-pier-for-families-in-need/8541259/). Taking up the challenge, the cutter’s crew offloaded the trees and packaged and loaded them to be delivered. More than a half dozen community groups helped deliver the trees to Chicago-area families.

One of the groups is the Englewood pastors. “Because of COVID we weren’t sure if they were going to do it this year, so we assured them that if the trees are available, we will be coming from the Navy Pier to Englewood to deliver those trees and help people with a little Christmas joy,” said Pastor St. John Chisum. “You would be surprised how just a tree can make a difference in somebody’s life,” said Pastor Willard Peyton.

As for the Coast Guard, they said they were just happy to help. “Give back to those that deserve it, ” said Coast Guard Cmdr. Randy Preston.

The Christmas Ship is Chicago’s largest all-volunteer charitable support program for inner-city youth and their families at Christmas time. All trees are paid for by private donations,

The organization was inspired by the original [“Christmas Tree Ship](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/the-first-christmas-tree-ship-captain-herman-schuenemann-the-schooner-rouse-simmons/)“, the *Rouse Simmons*, a three-masted schooner that brought Christmas trees to Chicago at the beginning of the holiday season for over 30 years in the early 1900s. Waiting crowds easily recognized the schooner when they saw a Christmas tree tied to her mainmast and her decks loaded with thousands of Christmas trees destined for Chicago families.
