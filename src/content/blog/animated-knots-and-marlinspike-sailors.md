For those wishing to learn just a bit about sailor’s knots, [Animated Boating Knots](http://www.animatedknots.com/indexboating.php?LogoImage=LogoGrog.jpg&Website=www.animatedknots.com) by Grog is a lot of fun.  Here is a rolling hitch, a marvelously useful knot that I invariably forget how to tie whenever a need one.   If you need to climb a halyard,  tie a warping line to an anchor rode, or take the load off a sheet fouled on a winch, there is nothing like it.  And even if you don’t need to do any of these things it is still a very nice knot to know.  After all, what’s knot to like?  Sorry.
