[![microcoral](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/08/microcoral.jpg)Coral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral) are individual invertebrate polyps living in communities, which can grow to become vast reefs. Until recently, there was no way to examine the living coral polyps in their own habitat. Now, researchers at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC–San Diego](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) have developed an underwater microscope that that makes that possible for the first time. As reported by [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/video/video/2016/08/a_new_underwater_microscope_shows_tiny_marine_life_as_it_really_is_video.html):

*The first-of-its-kind microscope has two parts: a computer with a diver-friendly interface, and a microscopic imaging unit. It sports an electronically tunable high-magnification lens, a ring of LED lights for fast shutter speeds, and fluorescence imaging. “The system is capable of seeing features as small as single cells underwater,” according to one of its designers, Ph.D. student Andrew Mullen.*
