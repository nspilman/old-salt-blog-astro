The North River Historic Ship Festival is returning for the sixth year to Hudson River Park’s Pier 25 in Lower Manhattan from Friday, June 20 to Tuesday June 24.  The festival will offer 500 free boat rides aboard historic vessels, hands-on tours of museum ships, a showboat circus, fishing on the pier, a party on a wooden barge, and more!  The festival will welcome thousands of people to Hudson River Park’s Pier 25 at N. Moore Street and the Hudson River to celebrate the Summer Solstice. The historic vessels and their salty captains will help tell the story of what was once a busy commercial riverfront.
