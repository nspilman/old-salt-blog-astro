On May 27, 1941, the German battleship *[Bismarck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_battleship_Bismarck)* had just sunk the pride of the Royal Navy, *HMS Hood.* As she was close to escaping into safe waters, *Bismarck* was attacked by a swarm of obsolete [Fairey Swordfish biplanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairey_Swordfish) launched from the carrier *[HMS Ark Royal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Ark_Royal_\(1914\))*.   Lt-Cdr  John “Jock” Moffat, one of the Swordfish pilots, died recently at the age of 97. Lt Cdr Moffat was credited with launching the torpedo that crippled the *Bismarck* in 1941. 

As reported by the [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-38297099):  *Mr Moffat and his crew took off in his Swordfish L9726 from the deck of Ark Royal and headed for the Bismarck, fighting against driving rain, low cloud and a gale.*

*Naval chiefs said he flew in at 50ft, nearly skimming the surface of the waves, in a hail of bullets and shells, to get the best possible angle of attack on the ship.*  *At 21:05 he dropped the torpedo which hit its target, jamming the rudder of Hitler’s flagship.*  *Speaking to BBC Scotland earlier this year, he said: “The Bismarck turned on its side and all these sailors seemed to be in the water – it lived with me for a long time.”*  *The battleship was forced to steam in circles until the guns of the Royal Navy’s home fleet arrived the next morning.*

*“When Churchill gave the order to sink the Bismarck, we knew we just had to stop her trail of devastation at all costs,” he said.* *“The great thing about the Swordfish was that the bullets just went straight through. After all, it was only made of canvas. It was like David and Goliath.”*

*Born in Kelso in June 1919, he joined the Navy as a reservist in 1938 and was posted to Ark Royal with 759 Naval Air Squadron after qualifying as a pilot.*

*After the war he trained as a hotel manager and remained with the profession for decades. He took up flying again in his 60s and flew into his early 90s.*

*In recent years he campaigned for the No side in the Scottish independence referendum, appearing alongside Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson in 2014 to make the defence case for the Union.*

*Mr Moffat’s death was announced by the Royal Navy.*
