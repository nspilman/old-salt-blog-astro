![wg2cover](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/04/wg2cover.jpg)Happy Earth Day! Then again, I have always thought that we lived on a misnamed planet. The word “earth” is a synonym for dirt while 71% of the planet is covered by water.  Perhaps we should be saying Happy Ocean Day!

Whatever you choose to call the planet, it is changing.  In the [Carteret  
Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carteret_Islands) of Papua New Guinea in the South Pacific, the 1,500 residents are being forced from their homes by rising sea levels. Some believe the islands will be uninhabitable by 2015.  The island residents are being referred to as the “[world’s first climate change refugees](http://www.irinnews.org/report/78630/papua-new-guinea-the-world-s-first-climate-change-refugees).”

Recently the [U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued a series of landmark reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/) on the current state of consensus science on climate change. As reported by Eric Holthaus on [Slate.com](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/04/david_titley_climate_change_war_an_interview_with_the_retired_rear_admiral.html): “*In a sentence, here’s what they found: On our current path, climate change could pose an irreversible, existential risk to civilization as we know it—but we can still fix it if we decide to work together.*”

So bottom line, if we all cooperate in our common self interest, we may find ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.  On the other hand, climate change may be just another excuse to slaughter each other.

Last month retired Navy Rear Adm. David Titley co-wrote an op-ed for [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/03/31/time-for-real-leadership-on-climate-change-energy-national-security/?intcmp=trending):

“*The parallels between the political decisions regarding climate change we have made and the decisions that led Europe to World War One are striking – and sobering. The decisions made in 1914 reflected political policies pursued for short-term gains and benefits, coupled with institutional hubris, and a failure to imagine and understand the risks or to learn from recent history.”*

Holthaus comments, “*In short, climate change could be the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the 21st century.*”

So, happy Earth Day, or Ocean Day, or whatever you may wish to call it.  It is a good day to think about the climate change refugees on the Carteret Islands and what we can do to limit the impact of climate change.  It is also a good time to consider the consequences if we choose to do nothing.
