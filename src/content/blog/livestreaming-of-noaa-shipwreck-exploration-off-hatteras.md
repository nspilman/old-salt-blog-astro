Okeanos Explorer

On June 25th, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will be investigating an unidentified shipwreck 40 miles off the coast of Hatteras Island using a robotic submersible launched from the research vessel [*Okeanos Explorer*](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/welcome.html).  The exploration will be livestreamed with viewing at the [North Carolina Aquarium](https://www.visitnc.com/story/WeXY/under-the-sea-family-fun-at-north-carolina-s-aquariums?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=kids&utm_content=new&gclid=CjwKCAjwsJ3ZBRBJEiwAtuvtlBrIBp76cehV0yr9et-r3A1anggbQ4JWnlQ89eJSByv5CkYCEz43IxoCeIEQAvD_BwE&dclid=CPKkhP3_3dsCFcEONwodkkQPFg) on Roanoke Island. The broadcast will take place in the aquarium’s Neptune’s Theater from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.  [Coastal Review Online](https://www.coastalreview.org/2018/06/shipwreck-exploration-to-be-livestreamed/) reports: 

*Visitors will be able to ask guest experts questions who will point out significant developments and even communicate directly with the Okeanos archaeological team. The UNC Coastal Studies Institute will also be on hand to present a 3-D underwater shipwreck video shot in North Carolina waters*, *and offer educational interpretation of that diving adventure.*

*The shipwreck is in about 1,000 feet of water and its origins and the circumstances by which it sank are unknown, according to the release. NOAA maritime archaeologist Joe Hoyt said that records indicate several World War II-era vessels were sunk in that area, but that an up-close investigation is the only way to confirm the ship’s identity and history. During the eight-hour dive, the submersible will broadcast video back to the Okeanos’ crew, which will search for telling clues like damage from artillery or torpedoes.*

*“What we’re getting is a unique opportunity to witness the uncovering of a real maritime mystery,” said aquarium Associate Director Allen McDowell in a statement. “And NOAA has graciously allowed us to go along for the ride.”*
