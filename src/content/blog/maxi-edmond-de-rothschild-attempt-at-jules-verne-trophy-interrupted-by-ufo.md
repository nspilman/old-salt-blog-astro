![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/11/gitana17.jpg)Yesterday, [we posted about a head to head race](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/11/foiling-maxi-trimarans-race-head-to-head-for-jules-verne-trophy/) between trimarans  [*Sodebo*](https://www.sodebo.com/aventure-voile/) and [*Maxi Edmond de Rothschild/Gitana 17*](http://www.gitana-team.com/en/) attempting to win the [Jules Verne Trophy](http://www.tropheejulesverne.org/en/). While the race for the trophy is against the clock, the two boats that sailed within hours of each other, sailing what amounted to a Maxi-match race, added a novel element to their attempt to beat the existing speed record for voyaging around the world under sail. The match race, however, between the maxi-tris has ended.  

After three days at sea, the attempt by the crew of the foiling trimaran *Maxi Edmond de Rothschild* has been [interrupted by a high-speed collision with a UFO](http://www.gitana-team.com/en/) (an Unidentified Floating Object.) The trimaran is returning to port for repairs, intending to restart the race once the repairs are completed and a favorable weather window presents itself.

Coincidentally, the current Jules Verne Trophy record holder, Francis Joyon and his crew sailing *IDEC Sport,* interrupted their attempt on the same day in 2016 after sailing into unfavorable winds in the doldrums. They restarted their attempt 19 days later, setting the current record of 40 days 23 hours 30 minutes 30 seconds. 

[Sail-world.com](https://www.sail-world.com/news/233491/Gitana-Team-interrupts-Jules-Verne-Trophy-attempt) describes the collision: *On Thursday afternoon, whilst slipping along downwind at over 30 knots between the Azores and Madeira, the Maxi Edmond de Rothschild hits a UFO (Unidentified Floating Object). The impact is violent, immediately causing the 32-metre giant to slow. Franck Cammas and Charles Caudrelier’s crew alerts the shore team and begins its investigations. The effect of the impact on the rudder of the port float and more precisely its trim tab, has caused a piece of the steering system to break.*

After deciding to turn back, the crew of the *Edmond de Rothschild* also discovered damage to the port foil, confirming their decision to return to port for repairs.
