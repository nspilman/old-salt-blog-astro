Raine Island, Australia, on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef, is one of the world’s largest nesting sites for green sea turtles. Researchers have found that drone cameras are the best way to count the young sea turtles.  Using the drone footage researchers have estimated that there were around 64,000 of the endangered green sea turtles at the rookery or almost twice as many as previously estimated.
