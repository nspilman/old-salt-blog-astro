Oak trees in Colbert’s forest

We recently posted about [Constitution Grove](https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/2015/05/11/the-wooden-walls/), a 50,000-acre private forest maintained by the US Navy, in part to provide white oak trees used in maintaining the [USS *Constitution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution), the oldest commissioned naval vessel still afloat. The forest is part of the [Naval Support Activity Crane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Surface_Warfare_Center_Crane_Division), 35 miles southwest of Bloomington, Indiana. 

The United States is by no means the only country to set aside forests for ship construction and repair. Indeed, Constitution Grove is relatively new and largely ceremonial.  The grove was only dedicated on May 8, 1976. By contrast, French Minister [Jean-Baptiste Colbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Colbert) ordered the planting of [oak groves to supply the needs of the future French navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_of_Tron%C3%A7ais) way back in 1607. Planting continued up and through the Napoleonic era.

The dedication of Constitution Grove was apparently inspired by [difficulties in procuring seasoned white oak](https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/2015/05/11/the-wooden-walls/) in a 1973 restoration of the USS *Constitution.* While seasoned white oak of the right dimension for planking may not be easy to find, the good news is that there is no shortage of white oak trees in the United States.

[One source](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/whats-the-difference-between-american-oak-and-french-oak-for-barrel-aged-wines-42395) notes that white oak trees are grown in 18 states. They estimate there are 5.2 billion white oak trees in the U.S. in forests covering a total of about 235,000 square miles. France today has [34,000 square miles of oak forests compared to 4,000 in the UK](https://waterfordwhisky.com/element/french-oak/) and less than 2,000 in Ireland. ([Admiral Collingwood would not be pleased](http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northeast/series7/collingwood.shtml#:~:text=Planting%20acorns,of%20timber%20for%20British%20ships.&text=He%20knew%20that%20it%20took,build%20a%20ship%20like%20Victory.).)

If the navies of the world have only a limited need for white oak, what is it being used for? The answer is barrels. And not just any barrels, but [vintners barrels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_\(wine\)#:~:text=New%20World%20Pinot%20noir%20may,earthy%20cedar%20and%20herbal%20character.) used to age wine, cognac, sherry, and whiskey. [Winespector.com](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/whats-the-difference-between-american-oak-and-french-oak-for-barrel-aged-wines-42395) notes that most of the French oak for barrels comes from one of five forests, some of which were originally planted during Napoleonic times for shipbuilding. 

Most of the oak barrels used for aging come from the United States or France. Which is better? [Winespector.com](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/whats-the-difference-between-american-oak-and-french-oak-for-barrel-aged-wines-42395) opines that speaking in broad generalities, French oak barrels are typically more subtle and spicy, offering textures of satin or silk. American barrels tend to be stronger in flavor, often described as cream soda, vanilla, or coconut, resulting in wines with a more creamy texture. 

Trees meant to build ships are now are being used for barrels for all sorts of fine spirits. Not quite swords to plowshares, but certainly men-of-war to wine and whiskey. The next time you enjoy a particularly good bottle of French wine, you might consider raising a toast to Colbert and the French Navy.
