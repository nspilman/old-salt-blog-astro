Three Royal Navy ships are on their way to help repatriate up to 200,000 Britons stranded by five days of flight restrictions following the Icelandic volcano eruption.

The aircraft carrier Ark Royal and the assault ships Ocean and Albion have been deployed to help increase cross-Channel options as the no-flight ban across Britain was extended until 1am tomorrow.   Extra capacity is being provided on coaches, ferries and Eurostar and Eurotunnel trains.
