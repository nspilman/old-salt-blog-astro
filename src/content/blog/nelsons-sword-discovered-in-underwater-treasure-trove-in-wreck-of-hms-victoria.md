Wreck of HMS Victoria

While on peace time maneuvers off Libya on June 22, 1893, [Vice Admiral George Tryon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Tryon), the commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet, gave a series of orders that resulted in [HMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Camperdown_\(1885\)) *[Camperdow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Camperdown_\(1885\))n* ramming his ship, [HMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Victoria_\(1887\)) *[Victoria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Victoria_\(1887\)),* which sank with the loss of 358 lives, including that of the vice admiral.  Also believed to have been lost in the sinking was Admiral Tryon’s collection of Nelson’s personal effects, which he had purchased at auction, including Nelson’s sword.  The wreck of  HMS *Victoria* was discovered in 2004 in 150 metres of water.  Now, Diver Mark Ellyatt says that he discovered Nelson’s sword and other artifacts in Tryon’s cabin.

[Nelson’s £1million sword is discovered at the bottom of the Med (but the shipwreck it’s on is called the Victoria, not the Victory)](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2093409/Nelsons-sword-hidden-looters-diver-discovered-wreck-HMS-Victoria.html)  
  
*The sword is said to have been among a haul of Nelson memorabilia that belonged to Vice Admiral George Tyron.*

*Collectors could pay up to £1m for the artifact – which is the same one that the Naval Lord shown holding on Nelson’s Column in central London.*

*However, there are concerns about who would claim ownership of the sword if it is recovered from the sea.*

*Mr Ellyatt said he found the sword in Tryon’s cabin which had an adjoining cupboard containing a number of items that belonged to Nelson.*

*‘The MoD wanted to know the whereabouts of anything to do with Nelson. They didn’t want it appearing on auction websites,’ Mr Ellyatt told the Telegraph.*

*‘They were very interested in the sword but seemed to get cold feet when I offered to bring it up for them. I don’t want people to go and strip the ship bare.*

*‘I would like to bring the sword to the surface but I worry that it would be seized by the local authorities. If the items are to be recovered, I would like to see them end up in a museum in the UK.’*

*Mr Ellyatt said that he has hidden the weapon inside the wreck to protect it from looters.*
