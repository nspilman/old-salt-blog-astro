We [recently posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/04/update-gunboats-new-g4-flying-cruiser/) about [Gunboat’s new G4](http://www.gunboat.com/series/gunboat-g4/) carbon-fiber catamaran which can fly on foils. ([It can also capsize dramatically.](https://vimeo.com/125378004))  As high tech and leading edge as the G4 may be, it is not the first cruising foiling multihull.  Forty five years ago in the late 60s, David Keiper built a foiling trimaran, Williwaw. He ultimately sailed the 31′ tri 20,000 miles across the Pacific, including several West Coast to Hawaii Passages and a voyage to Samoa, New Zealand and Tahiti.  He would go on to write a book about his voyages —  [Hydrofoil Voyager: WILLIWAW, From Dream To Reality and Toward the Sailing Yacht of the Future](http://www.amazon.com/Hydrofoil-Voyager-WILLIWAW-Reality-Sailing/dp/1466350164/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1429046343&sr=8-1&keywords=HYDROFOIL+VOYAGER).  David Keiper died of a heart attack in 1998, at the age of 67.  A rough video of the flying trimaran.
