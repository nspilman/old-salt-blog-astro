In addition to serving as a crew member on three Space Shuttle missions, [Kathryn Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_D._Sullivan) was also the first American woman to walk in space on October 11, 1984. Now, at 68, she has become the first woman to reach the [Challenger Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_Deep), about seven miles below the ocean’s surface, the deepest spot in the world’s oceans. 

Kathryn Sullivan became the eight-person to travel 35,810-feet below the surface to the Challenger Deep, descending in the [DSV](https://fivedeeps.com/home/technology/sub/) *[Limiting Factor](https://fivedeeps.com/home/technology/sub/)* piloted by [Victor Vescovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Vescovo) of Caladan Oceanic.

Last year, Victor Vescovo became the fourth person in history to reach Challenger Deep as part of his [Five Deeps Expedition](https://fivedeeps.com/); over the course of 7 days, his team made 5 dives in the Mariana Trench.

Shortly after returning to the surface, [EYOS Expeditions](https://www.eyos-expeditions.com/) coordinated a call between the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html) (ISS) and the DSSV *Pressure Drop*, the mothership of submersible DSV *Limiting Factor*. 

In a [statement from EYOS Expeditions](https://www.eyos-expeditions.com/kathy-sullivan-becomes-first-woman-to-challenger-deep-eyos-coordinates-call-between-international-space-station-and-dssv-pressure-drop/), Kathy Sullivan said, “As a hybrid oceanographer and astronaut this was an extraordinary day, a once in a lifetime day, seeing the moonscape of the Challenger Deep and then comparing notes with my colleagues on the ISS about our remarkable reusable inner-space outer-spacecraft.”

Victor Vescovo said, “We made some more history today… and then got to share the experience with kindred spirits in the ISS. It was a pleasure to have Kathy along both as an oceanographer during the dive, and then as an astronaut to talk to the ISS.”
