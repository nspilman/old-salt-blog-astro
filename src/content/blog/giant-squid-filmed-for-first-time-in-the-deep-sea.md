![giantsquid1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/giantsquid1.jpg)They are the subject of myth and legend, the giant squid who battle massive sperms whales and leave battle scars on the whales’ flesh. Now for the first time in history, a living giant squid has been recorded in its own habitat, nearly a third of a mile below the surface. Dead giant squids have been found washed up on shore or caught in nets but this is the first time that one has been seen live on video. Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing the news along.

*“The giant squid was so beautiful that it seemed to sparkle,” Tsunemi Kubodera, one of the lead scientists on the expedition, told reporters. “I was so thrilled when I saw it first hand, but I was confident we would because we rigorously researched the areas we might find it, based on past data.”*

*Using a manned submarine, Kubodera and his colleagues took 100 trips below the surface to spot the stealthy squid. The team used a specially designed camera to capture high definition images in deep water.*
