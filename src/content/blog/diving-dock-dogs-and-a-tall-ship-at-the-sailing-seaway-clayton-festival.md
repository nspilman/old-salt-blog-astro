![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Website-Header-SSC-2.jpg)There have been lots of festivals this season with tall ships, but how many can boast dock diving dogs?  Last October, we posted about the [new and growing sport of dock dogs](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/10/07/dock-dogs-and-diving-horses/), where dogs competing on how far they can jump into the water. This weekend’s [Sailing Seaway Clayton](http://www.sailingseawayclayton.com/2012/05/festival-schedule-announced.html) festival in Clayton, New York will feature a visit by the [STV *Fair Jeanne*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STV_Fair_Jeanne), but will also include a Seaway Splash dock dog competition.  Dogs will be able to compete in three events – “Extreme Vertical,” and  “Speed Retrieve.”  The Seaway Splash events will be held on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  [Click here for a detailed schedule](http://www.sailingseawayclayton.com/2012/05/festival-schedule-announced.html).   On Thursday at 6PM there will be a boat parade to escort the STV *Fair Jeanne* into port.  The  *Fair Jeanne* will also be open for tours on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
