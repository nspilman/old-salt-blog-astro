![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/10/b-39.jpg)For the last 15 years, the Soviet-era [Foxtrot-class diesel-electric submarine *B-39*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_B-39) has been a museum ship at the [Maritime Museum of San Diego](https://sdmaritime.org/). Now, with its outer hull deteriorating, the museum has decided to scrap the retired attack submarine. 

[Stars and Stripes](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2021-10-02/russian-sub-b-39-san-diego-maritime-museum-3101935.html) reports that museum officials said the sub is not as bad as it looks — that the pressure hull remains stable, making *B-39* as seaworthy as it was when it debuted at the Embarcadero in 2005.

“But that doesn’t make its condition cosmetically acceptable in so prominent a location,” said Raymond Ashley, president and CEO of the museum.

It detracts, he added, from the beauty of the other ships in the museum’s collection. They include the iron-hulled sailing ship [*Star of India*](https://sdmaritime.org/visit/the-ships/star-of-india/), the steam ferry [*Berkeley*](https://sdmaritime.org/visit/the-ships/steam-ferry-berkeley/), the replica frigate HMS [*Surprise*](https://sdmaritime.org/visit/the-ships/hms-surprise/), and another submarine, the USS [*Dolphin*](https://sdmaritime.org/visit/the-ships/uss-dolphin-submarine/).

So B-39, closed to the public since the coronavirus pandemic started more than a year ago, is headed to Ensenada, Mexico, where it will be scrapped and recycled, Ashley said. The museum is awaiting approval from the U.S. Coast Guard for a towing permit.

Commissioned in 1967, the 295′ long submarine *B-39* was one of the Soviet Navy’s largest non-nuclear submarines and among the largest conventionally powered submarines ever built.

Low-tech but lethal, she carried 24 torpedoes while she was on patrol-some capable of delivering low-yield nuclear warheads. *B-39* carried a crew of 78 and could dive to a depth of 985 feet.
