I am looking forward to reading *[Admiralty Orders](http://www.amazon.com/Admiralty-Orders-Under-Quintrell-ebook/dp/B00EFZHDZG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1376225059&sr=1-1&keywords=Under+Admiralty+Orders+-+The+Oliver+Quintrell+Series).*  From its Amazon page*: Book 3 in the Oliver Quintrell Series, sees Captain Quintrell facing life-threatening events over which he has no control. Ordered to sail to Gibraltar in the late summer of 1804, his ship soon becomes hemmed in, not by Spanish gunboats or French ships of the line, but by the Quarantine Regulations which close the port around him. Unable to halt the loss of life from a raging epidemic, he strives to do his part to help save the Colony when it is at its most vulnerable.*
