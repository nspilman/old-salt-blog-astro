![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/07/whale-collision.jpg)An update to our [previous post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/31/dead-humpback-whale-pinned-to-bow-of-the-sapphire-princess/) – the *[Sapphire Princess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire_Princess)* [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire_Princess)cruise ship, which was found to have impaled a female humpback whale on her bulbous bow last week, probably did not kill the whale.  A necropsy finished this week suggests that the whale was already dead.  This is the second dead whale impaled by the *Sapphire Princess* in two years.  Almost exactly a year ago, the *Sapphire Princess* arrived in Vancouver with 70′ fin whale impaled on its bow.  A subsequent necropsy determined that the fin whale had also probably been dead when struck by the cruise ship.
