![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/07/190px-Josephhewes.jpg)Happy 4th of July to all.   On July 4th, Americans celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence from Great Britain in 1776.   [Joseph Hewes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hewes) was one of the lesser known signatories to the Declaration.   He was born in New Jersey, prospered as a merchant in Philadelphia and then moved to North Carolina.  He represented North Carolina in the Continental Congress and in 1776 was appointed the chairman of the naval committee.

Americans have had a  tendency throughout our history to glorify the “founding fathers,” often rewriting history in the process.  Rather than viewing the founders as complex individuals with virtues and vices, they are often mythologized as all purpose role models.  Joseph Hewes is either beneficiary or victim, depending on how you look at it,  of this sort of mythologizing.  
  
Hewes is often referred to as the “first Secretary of the Navy.”   It is also claimed that he provided the Continental Navy with ” *his own extensive fleet of ships, outfitted them, and chose the most capable of men to captain these ships*.”   The [Wikipedia page dedicated to Hewes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hewes) goes so far as to claim that “*alongside General George Washington, Hewes became one of the greatest military achievers in American history.*”

Calling Hewes “Secretary of the Navy” before the colonies were a nation or had a significant naval force is a bit of a stretch, but not so bad in the grand scheme of things. Claiming that Hewes contributed an “extensive fleet of ships” is interesting but seems to be unsupported by history.  Where the assertion comes from is unclear but in the [“Lives of American merchants, eminent for integrity, enterprise and public spirit](http://www.archive.org/details/livesofamericanmcopy01fros)” published  in 1844, there is no mention of Hewes “extensive fleet of ships.”   The only reference is to  his responsibilities related to “ *the disbursements of the naval committee were under his especial charge, and eight armed vessels were fitted out with the funds placed at his disposal.*”   Claiming that  “*alongside General George Washington, Hewes became one of the greatest military achievers in American history*, ”  is simply bizarre.

Hewes was also active in the Continental Congress in non-naval matters.   Joseph Hewes sided with fellow North Carolina delegate, Edward Rutledge in demanding the Declaration allow slavery.  While Hewes was raised as a Quaker, he was indeed also a slave owner and a supporter of slavery.

The US Navy named a troop ship in honor of Joseph Hewes.   The ship was built as the passenger liner *Excaliber* for American Export Lines in 1930.  She was a acquired by the Navy in January of 1942 and renamed the [USS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Joseph_Hewes_\(AP-50\)) *[Joseph Hewes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Joseph_Hewes_\(AP-50\)).* She was sunk by a German submarine in November of the same year with the loss of approximately 100 seamen.
