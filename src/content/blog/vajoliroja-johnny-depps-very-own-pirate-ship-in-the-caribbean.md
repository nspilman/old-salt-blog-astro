I ‘ve got to say that I prefer Neil Young’s and David Crosby’s taste in yachts somewhat better, but Johnny Depp’s *Vajoliroja* does have a certain idiosyncratic style.

[Johnny Depp’s very own pirate ship in the Caribbean](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/04/26/johnny.depp.pirate.ship/?hpt=C2)  
  
*Hollywood actor Johnny Depp is arguably best-known for his role as maverick captain Jack Sparrow in the wildly popular “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise.  Now, he has taken things a step further with his own pirate-inspired ship in the Caribbean.*

*It may not be as creepy as the “Pirates of the Caribbean’s” “Black Pearl,” but Depp’s ship “Vajoliroja” has more than a hint of the swashbuckler about it. Depp has completely refitted the ship to his taste, with velvet wall hangings and furniture in rich burgundies and gold.  Wannabe pirates can test their sea legs on Depp’s yacht, which is available for charter, although it’s not cheap. One week aboard the ship, which hosts up to 11 guests and eight crew, costs a cool $130,000.*
