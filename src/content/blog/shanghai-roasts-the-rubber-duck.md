![RoastedDuck27e](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/08/RoastedDuck27e.jpg)In June, we posted about the Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman’s traveling [16.5 metre-tall “Rubber Duck,”](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/06/spreading-joy-around-the-world-aka-rubber-duck-inflated-deflated-revived-censored/) which has visited 13 cities in nine different countries.  It last visited [Hong Kong harbor and is now reported to be on its way to Pittsburgh](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/06/hong-kong-bids-rubber-duck-adieu-as-pittsburgh-welcomes-inflated-yellow-avian/).  In the spirit of fun, Shanghai now has its own interpretation of a “roasted rubber duck,” with crispy brown skin, drumsticks in the air and the duck’s head turned aft.
