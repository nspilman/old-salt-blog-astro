As we have [posted about previously](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/07/17/serious-threat-to-endangered-whales-ship-strikes-entangling-nets/), the greatest threat to many species of endangered whales is from ship strikes and entanglement in fishing nets. The dead 50′ fin whale that drifted into Boston harbor recently is a reminder of this.  Researchers are not sure how the whale died but extensive bruising suggests that the whale may have become wrapped in some sort of line or cable. A ship strike has also not been ruled out as a possible cause of death. Thanks to Irwin Bryan for passing the news along.
