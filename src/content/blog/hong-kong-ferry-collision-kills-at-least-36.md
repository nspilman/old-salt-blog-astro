At least 36 people drowned when a ferry carrying more than 120 collided with another vessel and sank last night around 8:30 pm local time near Lamma island off Hong Kong.   The ferry was taking staff and family members of the Hongkong Electric Company to watch fireworks in the city’s Victoria Harbour to celebrate China’s National Day and mid-autumn festival.

[36 Confirmed Dead in Hong Kong Ferry Collision](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/world/asia/36-confirmed-dead-in-hong-kong-ferry-collision.html)

*As of Tuesday morning, 36 people were confirmed to have died in the accident, and 9 of the more than 100 people who were hospitalized had sustained serious injuries or were in critical condition, according to a government statement.*

*Rescue operations continued Tuesday morning, and the Hong Kong fire department said it could not rule out that there were still people inside the vessel or missing. Low visibility and many obstacles on board were hampering the rescue efforts.* 

*Photos from the site showed the ferry half submerged, with its bow pointing nearly straight up, off Lamma Island. One of the largest of Hong Kong’s many islands, Lamma is connected to Hong Kong by regular ferry services that take about 30 minutes each way.*
