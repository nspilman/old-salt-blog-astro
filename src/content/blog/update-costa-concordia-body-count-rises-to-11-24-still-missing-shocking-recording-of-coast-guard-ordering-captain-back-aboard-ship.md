Divers searching the wreck of the *Costa Concordia* have found five more bodies in the submerged section of the ship.  All were wearing life jackets and are believed to be passengers.  The number of missing, which had been as low as 11, has been revised upward to 24.

A shocking audio recording has emerged in which the ship’s captain, Francesco Schettino, was heard making excuses as the Italian Coast Guard repeatedly ordered him to return to oversee his ship’s evacuation.  *[Corriere della Sera](http://corrierefiorentino.corriere.it/firenze/notizie/cronaca/2012/17-gennaio-2012/guardia-costiera-comandante-torni-nave-schettino-gip-1902900833568.shtml)* put the tape, which it said was recorded by the Coast Guard, on its [website](http://corrierefiorentino.corriere.it/firenze/notizie/cronaca/2012/17-gennaio-2012/guardia-costiera-comandante-torni-nave-schettino-gip-1902900833568.shtml).  [A transcript of the recording translated into English is posted here.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16599655)
