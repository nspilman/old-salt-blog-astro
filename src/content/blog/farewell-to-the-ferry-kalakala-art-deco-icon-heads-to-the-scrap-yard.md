The ferry [*MV Kalaka*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Kalakala) is making its [last voyage today, a short trip to the scrap yard](http://www.thenewstribune.com/2015/01/21/3599215_ferry-kalakala-making-last-trip.html?rh=1). The 276′ ferry carried millions of cars in the Puget Sound between Seattle and Bremerton between 1935 and 1967 and was notable for her streamlined form, art deco styling and luxurious amenities.  After more than thirty years of service, she was decommissioned and towed to Alaska to be used as a crab and fish processor at Dutch Harbor and Kodiak. She was returned to the Seattle area in 1998 but despite the efforts of various owners with a range of restoration plans, the ship became a derelict.  *MV Kalaka* will be towed roughly a mile from a dock on the Hylebos Waterway, where she has been moored for a decade, to a graving dock on the Blair Waterway, where she will be scrapped.

The video below shows news clips from her maiden voyage and about the installation of radar in 1946 which was the first to be installed on a commercial vessel.  The video clips also show the view from the bridge.  Because of the round ports and generally poor visibility from the bridge, the ferry earned a reputation as being difficult to handle when docking.
