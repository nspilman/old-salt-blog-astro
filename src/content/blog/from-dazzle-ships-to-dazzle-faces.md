Dazzle Faces

We recently posted “[The Dazzle Ships, Then and Now](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/07/the-dazzle-ships-then-and-now/),” about the use of wild geometric patterns painted on ships, which do nothing to hide the ship, but are/were meant to confuse enemy weapons targeting.  Recently, the artist, designer, and entrepreneur, [Adam Harvey](http://ahprojects.com/), created computer vision dazzle, or CV dazzle, designed to fool increasingly sophisticated computer facial recognition software.  Developed as a student at [NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program](http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/), Harvey’s CV dazzle uses make-up and hair to disrupt the computer algorithms used to identify faces.  He explains the rationale in the New York Times from last December — [Face to Anti-Face](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/14/opinion/sunday/20121215_ANTIFACE_OPART.html).

*Next year the Janus program, an initiative run by the director of national intelligence, will begin to collect photographs of people’s faces from social media websites and public video feeds. Machines will then use powerful algorithms to pair those photos with existing biometric profiles….*

*My project, CV Dazzle, explores how fashion can be used as camouflage from face-detection technology, the first step in automated face recognition. The name is derived from a type of World War I naval camouflage called Dazzle, which used cubist-inspired designs to break apart the visual continuity of a battleship and conceal its orientation and size. Likewise, CV Dazzle uses avant-garde hairstyling and makeup designs to break apart the continuity of a face. Since facial-recognition algorithms rely on the identification and spatial relationship of key facial features, like symmetry and tonal contours, one can block detection by creating an “anti-face.”*
