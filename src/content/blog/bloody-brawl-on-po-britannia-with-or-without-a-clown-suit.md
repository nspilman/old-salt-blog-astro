![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/07/pobritannia.jpg)In the general category of you can’t make this stuff up, in early hours of Friday morning, a mass brawl broke out on the P&O Britannia, in which passengers used furniture and plates as weapons, according to witnesses. Six people—three men and three women—were treated for bruises and cuts sustained in the melee. The ship was returning from a week-long cruise to Norway’s fjords. The brawl reportedly followed an alcohol-fuelled afternoon of “patriotic” partying on the ship’s deck.

Here is where things get really odd. Early reports from multiple witnesses report that the brawl was triggered by the arrival of a man wearing a clown suit at a party in an upper deck restaurant on the ship.

The [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/27/passenger-in-clown-suit-prompts-mass-brawl-on-po-cruise-ship) reports, that *Richard Gaisford of ITV’s Good Morning Britain, who was on the cruise, said he was alerted to the incident when a 2am emergency tannoy announcement called for security to rush to the 16th-floor restaurant.*

*Gaisford tweeted on Saturday: “‘There was blood everywhere’. Violent late-night brawl in the buffet onboard P&O Cruises’ Britannia left staff who intervened injured, as passengers used furniture and plates as weapons. Witnesses told me they were so frightened they had to hide, as family groups fought.”*

*He said that, after hearing the tannoy, he went to the restaurant where he found “shocked” passengers. “One witness, part of a group involved in the trouble, explained to staff that things kicked off when another passenger appeared dressed as a clown. This upset one of their party because they’d specifically booked a cruise with no fancy dress. It led to a violent confrontation,” he wrote.*

*He added: “Britannia left Bergen at 14.30 on Thursday, the violence occurred 12 hours later after a black-tie evening. It followed an afternoon of ‘patriotic’ partying on deck, with large amounts of alcohol being consumed by many guests.*

One wonders exactly what is being referred to as “fancy dress” if there was a black-tie party. Black-tie on this side of the Atlantic might be considered as “fancy dress.” In any event, [several witnesses](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/27/po-cruise-passenger-playing-clown-sparks-mass-brawl-families/) indicated that a man in clown suit set off the melee.

P&O Cruises, however, is now saying that the “mass brawl” was [not caused by a clown](https://news.sky.com/story/mass-brawl-on-p-o-cruise-ship-not-caused-by-a-clown-says-company-11772216).  The company’s statement was corroborated by Hampshire Police, whose officers met the *Britannia* when it docked in Southampton.

Two people, a 43-year-old man, and a 41-year-old woman, both from Chigwell, Essex, were arrested on suspicion of assault.

And what of the reports of a man in a clown suit? Who knows?
