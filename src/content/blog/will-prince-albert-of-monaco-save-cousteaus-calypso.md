Calypso in better days

We [posted recently that Jacques Cousteau’s famous research vessel, *Calypso,*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/03/cousteaus-calypso-in-peril/) might be in danger of being sold or scrapped.  The *Calypso*, however, may have a savior in [Prince Albert II  of Monaco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_II,_Prince_of_Monaco).

After a long legal battle, a French court ordered Francine Cousteau, the second wife of the late Jacques Cousteau, to settle outstanding yard bills and remove the RV *Calypso* from a Brittany shipyard by March 13. If she failed to do so, the shipyard would be allowed to sell the 43 meter wooden research vessel.   Apparently for the last several months talks have been underway between the [Cousteau Society](http://www.cousteau.org/) and the [Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation](http://www.fpa2.com/home.html). [The Prince is said to be interested in acquiring scientific and educational material](http://www.monacowealthmanagement.com/articles/news/2015/20150320-calypso-may-come-to-monaco.php) of the famous French oceanographer, consisting in movies, books, photos including the ship *Calypso*.

If the ship is brought to Monaco, it will be something of a homecoming.  Jacques Cousteau served as the director of the [Oceanographic Museum of Monaco](http://www.oceano.mc/en) for more than three decades, from 1957 to 1988.  The *Calypso* was featured in Cousteau’s books and the award winning documentary “*Silent World*” as well the American TV series “[*The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undersea_World_of_Jacques_Cousteau)” which ran from 1968 to 1975.   Thanks to Erik Abranson for pointing out the news on the MarHistList.
