The [Manchester Ship Canal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Ship_Canal), from Liverpool to Manchester, was built in 1894 and was once large enough to serve any ocean-going ship.  Now a new container barge service is operating on the canal, saving on costs and cutting carbon emissions.

*“If you go into central Europe, Germany, the Rhineland, lots of barges are used,” said Gary Hodgson, the managing director of the Port of Liverpool and Manchester Ship Canal.*

*“However, over the last 25 years, the ship canal has been very much under-utilized, and we’re now revitalizing that excellent asset we have.”*

*Says Hodgson, some 10,000 containers are now being shipped down the canal — a service he says is already reaping benefits in terms of savings to consumers and, thanks to the barges’ lower carbon emissions, the environment.*

*But, he says, with the canal only taking 5% of container traffic handled by the port in Liverpool, there is considerable room for improvement. There are hopes that the canal will take up to 200,000 containers.*
