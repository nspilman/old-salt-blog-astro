John Fisher

Years ago, when I sailed briefly on tall ships, I heard that the two most at-risk groups when going aloft were total novices and the most experienced old hands. The novices knew little, while the experienced sailors grew complacent. This came to mind in reading new details which have emerged related to the tragic death of John Fisher, a sailor on the Volvo Ocean 65 *Sun Hung Kai-Scallywag,* who was lost at sea after being knocked overboard in the Southern Ocean last month. A few salient points:

This wasn’t the first time that a crew member on *Scallywag* went overboard. In January, the youngest member of *Scallywag*‘s crew, Alex Gough, 24, fell overboard during Leg 4. He was clearing a sheet while hanging over the side without wearing a harness. Gough was recovered without injury, but the incident may have suggested a lax attitude toward safety on the boat. John Fisher, who was lost overboard, was the boat’s safety officer.

Fisher was wearing a safety harness when he was knocked overboard but unclipped to move forward to clear a sheet. *Scallywag* was reportedly sailing at 20 to 30 knots, surfing down a wave when it accidentally jibed and Fisher was thrown over the side. Apparently, no jacklines were rigged. 

When Fisher was knocked overboard, the helmsman pushed the man-over-board button at the wheel to record the GPS position. Unfortunately, the button must be held down for four seconds, which in the confusion of the moment, did not happen.

Fisher was wearing an inflatable harness with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) attached. The AIS PLB should have allowed Scallywag to located Fisher electronically. The problem, however, that Scallywag’s AIS system didn’t work. The AIS antenna on *Scallywag* was damaged two days out of Auckland in high winds. The [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/sports/volvo-ocean-race.html) quotes *Scallywag*s’ skipper, David Witt saying, “If we had our A.I.S., we would have found him. I’ve learned that redundancies in this system is an example of change, like a second antenna.”

He added that he believed the race’s safety procedures worked well but that “we waste an awful lot of time and money” on safety equipment that is not as useful as a second antenna would be.

In the meantime, the show must go on, or in this case, [Leg 8 of the Volvo Ocean Race](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/22/sports/22reuters-sailing-volvo.html). *Scallywag,* which dropped out and diverted to Chile after Fisher’s death, rejoined the fleet, sailing yesterday from Itajai, Brazil bound for Newport, RI.
