Draken Harald Hårfagre has made it to Green Bay!

The [Green Bay Tall Ship Festival](http://tallshipgreenbay.com/) kicks off this Friday, August 5th, at noon and runs through Sunday, August 7th. It features nine tall ships, including the replica Viking longship [*Draken Harald Hårfagre*](http://www.drakenexpeditionamerica.com/). There had been some question as to [whether the longship would be able to make it to Green Bay](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/07/viking-longship-draken-harald-harfagre-sails-on-confused-inland-seas/) after encountering issues with pilotage fees in the Great Lakes. The other ships participating in the festival are [*El Galeón*](http://www.elgaleon.org/), [*S/V Denis Sullivan*](http://www.discoveryworld.org/exhibits/sailing-vessel-denis-sullivan/), [*U.S. Brig Niagara*](http://www.flagshipniagara.org/), [*Madeline*](http://www.maritimeheritagealliance.org/madeline), [*Windy*](https://tallshipwindy.com/), [*Appledore IV*](http://www.baysailbaycity.org/appledore/appledoreiv.htm), and [*When & If*](http://sailwhenandif.com/).  The festival also features food, music, educational events and activities for the kids.
