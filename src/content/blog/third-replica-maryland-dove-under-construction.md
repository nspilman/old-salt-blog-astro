![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/08/newmarylanddove.jpg)The [Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum](https://cbmm.org/) is nearing the completion of the construction of a new *[Maryland Dove](https://www.marylanddove.org/),* a reproduction of the 17th-century trading ship that accompanied the first settlers to what is now Maryland in 1634. *Maryland Dove* is owned by the state of Maryland and operated and maintained by the Historic St. Mary’s City Commission.

[*Ark* and *Dove*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Dove#The_original_Ark_and_Dove) were the two ships that began the Maryland Colony. *Dove* was a small, 40-ton capacity cargo ship purchased by Cecil Calvert and investors so that the colonists would have their own ship to use once Ark had sailed for England.

The new *Maryland Dove* is the third replica of the historic ship to be built. The first was built in 1934 to commemorate Maryland’s tercentenary. The second, in 1977, has served as a floating exhibit for Historic St. Mary’s City. The third *Maryland Dove* will be launched later this year.

A short video of this Summer’s progress building the new replica:
