![spotteddick300-1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/spotteddick300-1.jpg)An update to our previous post – [Spotted Dick Off the Menu](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/09/14/spotted-dick-off-the-menu/).  As reported by the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_east/8270460.stm):

*Council chiefs have reversed a decision to rename the pudding Spotted Dick after receiving “abusive letters” and accusations of political correctness.*

*Canteen staff at Flintshire council had decided it would be referred to as “Spotted Richard” on their menu after “immature comments” by some customers.*

*The council now says the pudding will revert to its traditional name.*

No word yet whether Boiled Baby will be added to the menu.   Boiled Baby is said to be similar to Spotted Dick, except without the raisins or eggs.
