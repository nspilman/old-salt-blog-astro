![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/silverstream.jpg)[Mediterranean Shipping Company](https://www.msc.com/usa) (MSC) has ordered more than 30 hull air lubrication systems from UK firm [Silverstream Technologies](https://www.silverstream-tech.com/) to be installed on current orders of newbuild large container ships. The vessels applying the air lubrication systems are expected to be delivered from shipyards in Asia in 2022-2024.

Silverstream’s technology has been demonstrated to save 5-10% of fuel and emissions by generating a rigid carpet of air bubbles that reduce friction between the hull and the water. 

“Over the vessels’ lifecycles, a carbon emissions reduction of 1.6m tonnes – equivalent to the annual emissions of 350,000 cars – could be achieved as a direct impact of having the system onboard,” Silverstream claimed in a release yesterday. Over the same period, MSC will see an estimated fuel saving of $300m.

Noah Silberschmidt, founder and CEO, Silverstream Technologies, said: “This order of more than 30 systems for MSC’s newbuild program is a landmark moment for both Silverstream and for clean technology adoption across shipping. It is the single largest order of not only our technology but of any air lubrication technology in the history of our market. We are extremely proud of this achievement and are ready for the challenge of managing our largest ever installation program at five different shipyards.”
