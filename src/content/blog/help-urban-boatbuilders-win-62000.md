In August we posted about [Rocking the Boat](http://www.rockingtheboat.org/), an after-school program in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, a borough of New York City, which has been teaching neighborhood kids to build wooden boats for the last 15 years. [Urban Boatbuilders](http://urbanboatbuilders.org/) offers a similar program which teaches boat building to youth in the St.Paul/Minneapolis area.   Urban Boatbuilders is now a finalist in the [Building Community Award](http://www.opus-group.com/BuildingCommunityAward#finalists). If they win, the program will receive a $62,000 grant.  All it takes is votes, which cost nothing but a moment of your time. If you have a moment [click here to vote](http://www.opus-group.com/BuildingCommunityAward) for a good cause.
