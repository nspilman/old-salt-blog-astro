![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Snow_Row_07_with_ferry.jpg)The [Hull Lifesaving Museum](http://www.lifesavingmuseum.org/) near Boston is sponsoring their 32nd Annual “Snow Row” this weekend. Festivities begin with the annual “[Snow Ball](http://www.lifesavingmuseum.org/calendarandevents.html#Specialevents)” this evening at the Clarion Nantasket Beach Resort and Conference Center, followed by Saturday’s race at the Windmill Point Boathouse, Hull.

[32nd Annual Snow Row](http://www.lifesavingmuseum.org/programsandworkshops.html#snowrow)  
  
*The Snow Row covers a 3 3/4 mile triangular course starting off the beach at Windmill Point, continuing around Sheep Island, past the Peddocks Island day marker, and back to shore. Huge crowds gather on the beach beside the museum’s Windmill Point Boathouse to share in the wild, LeMans-style start, unpredictable weather, and one-of-a-kind gathering of gorgeous boats and athletes. Entirely within view of the Boathouse, the event is as much of a thrill for spectators as for participants. A Harbor Express high speed ferry, with boarding at Pemberton Pier, follows the race course, affording spectators an even closer view of the event. It is also a rare opportunity to see, up close, rowers of all ages and their stunning array of wooden pulling boats — peapods, dories, wherries, whitehalls, ocean shells, kayaks, pilot gigs, captain’s gigs, and Irish currachs. For the tenth year, crews from Cornwall, U.K. will be coming to New England to participate. Youth and adult crews and rowers from all over New England, New York, and along the East Coast will join them.*

*The race has five boat categories: workboats, livery boats, coxed boats, ocean kayaks, and ocean shells. A few notes to all race participants: 1) all boats must carry PFDs, bailers, and whistles, 2) all coxed boats must pre-register and begin the race bow on the beach, and 3) the HLM Race Committee reserves the right to cancel the race or keep individual boats from setting forth due to weather conditions or rower skill level.*

*After watching the excitement of the Snow Row’s one-of-a-kind start, come to the Lifesaving Museum, a mile from the boathouse, which will be open throughout the day with free admission. For more information, please contact Lory Newmyer or Ed McCabe at the Hull Lifesaving Museum, 781-925-5433 or info@hulllifesavingmuseum.org.*
