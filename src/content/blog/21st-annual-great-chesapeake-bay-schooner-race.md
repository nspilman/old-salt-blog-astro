Around Fells Point and Baltimore’s Inner Harbor will be a glorious place for any schooner lover to be this evening.   There will be a parade of sail of the over forty schooners who are participating the [21st Annual Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race](http://www.schoonerrace.org/) starting at 1700.  Tomorrow the race from Baltimore to Portsmouth, Virgina starts at 1300.   This year, transponders installed on the racing schooners will allow spectators on the internet to follow the race down the bay on-line.  [Click here to see more.](http://kws.kattack.com/kattacklive/Offshore.aspx?FeedID=288)

To celebrate the arrival of the schooners, Portsmouth Virginia is sponsoring its [Schooner Days](http://www.virginia.org/site/description.asp?attrid=61766) –  a celebration of the world’s largest gathering of schooners along the waterfront of Olde Towne Portsmouth.
