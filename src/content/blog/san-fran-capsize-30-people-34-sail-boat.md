![sanfranrescue](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sanfranrescue.jpg)**UPDATE:** The initial reports of the capsize identified the boat which capsized as a sailboat.  Even the [Coast Guard’s website](http://coastguardnews.com/coast-guard-local-partners-respond-to-capsized-sailboat-with-30-people-aboard-near-san-francisco/2016/10/09/) said that the boat named *Khaleesi* was a 34-foot sailboat.  As initial reports often are, these reports were not accurate. The boat is not being reported to be a Silverton 34′ cabin cruiser.  Thanks to Greg Davids for his eyewitness account in the comments section below.

On Saturday, a 34′ recreational ~sailboat~ powerboat with 30 people aboard capsized in San Francisco Bay near Pier 45. All aboard were rescued but eight were injured, with at least one, a child, in critical condition. It could have been much, much worse.

The capsize took place following a Navy Blue Angels airshow as part of [San Francisco Fleet Week](http://fleetweeksf.org/). Fortunately, there were many spectator boats in the area and crews on nearby boats threw PFDs, life rings and cushions to the people in the water, who reportedly were not wearing life jackets. A crew member from one nearby boat dove into the cold bay water and swam over to the capsized sailboat to rescue a father and son who were trapped below deck. [A five year old is reported to be in critical condition](http://6abc.com/news/5-year-old-critical-after-boat-capsizes-off-san-francisco/1546249/) after being pulled from the water unconscious. CPR was administered by the one of the spectator boat crew members and continued by the fire department. Five adults and three children were transported to local hospitals.

The authorities have said that an investigation is on-going. That being said, in the case of 30 people aboard a 34 foot long recreational sailboat, it would be a considerable surprise if overloading did not contribute to the casualty.

The passengers of the capsized ~sailboat~ powerboat were also incredibly lucky. Were it not for the quick response by other boats in the area, as well as the Coast Guard and local police and fire departments, the outcome could have been much worse. [Bob Postel of the San Francisco fire department said](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Several-Youth-Trapped-Under-Boat-in-San-Francisco-Fire-Department-396422161.html), “This could have been really, really catastrophic,” he said. “For this to have the outcome that it did, is really a lot of good fortune and good luck.”

This is the second capsize of a recreational boat in San Francisco Bay within about a month. In September, 15 Sea Scouts and an adult leader ended up in the water after their catamaran capsized. No one was injured. All of the scouts were wearing life jackets.
