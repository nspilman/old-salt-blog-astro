![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/orskls.jpg)The [Ukrainian military claims](https://www.facebook.com/navy.mil.gov.ua/posts/340844301416492) to have destroyed the Russian [Alligator Class landing ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator-class_landing_ship) *Orsk* in the Ukrainian port city of Berdyansk, which Russia captured in late February. 

“The destroyed ship in Berdyansk could carry up to 20 tanks, 45 armored personnel carriers, and 400 paratroopers,” the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, Anna Malyar, said in a statement on Thursday. “This is a huge target that was hit by our military.”

At least two Alligator-class landing ships are listed in active service in Russia’s Black Sea Fleet: the *Orsk* and the *Saratov*. The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/world/europe/russian-landing-ship-berdyansk-ukraine.html) notes that the Ukrainian military said it had destroyed the *Orsk*, but it was not immediately clear from the visual evidence which ship was destroyed. Videos show other Russian ships, also appearing to have small fires with smoke rising, leaving the port while the Alligator-class vessel burns.
