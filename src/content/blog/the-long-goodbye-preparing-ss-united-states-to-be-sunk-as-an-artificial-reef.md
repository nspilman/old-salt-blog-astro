![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ssusmobile.jpg)The iconic passenger liner  [SS *United States*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States) arrived early Monday in Mobile, Alabama, nearly two weeks after [departing under tow from South Philadelphia](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2025/02/historic-passenger-liner-ss-united-states-finally-departs-philadelphia-on-its-last-voyage/). She was docked at Modern American Recycling Service (MARS), where if all goes according to plan, she will be stripped of non-metal and potentially hazardous materials in preparation to be sunk as the world’s largest artificial reef, off the coast of Destin-Fort Walton Beach in the Gulf of Mexico. The remediation is expected to take until the end of this year.

The SS *United States* was taken out of service in 1969. Last year, [Okaloosa County, FL purchased the ship](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2024/08/historic-ocean-liner-ss-united-states-in-deal-to-be-sunk-as-artificial-reef/) for $1 million and budgeted an additional $8 million for remediation, transport, and deployment. The project also includes plans for a land-based museum dedicated to the ship.

A last minute attempt to save the ship from being sunk is being mounted by the [New York Coalition to Save the SS United States](https://www.nycsavessus.org/). They propose mooring the ship in South Red Hook, Brooklyn, NY at the Gowanus Bay Terminal (GBX™) to be used as a public waterfront mixed-use center. 

The coalition is partnering with with John Quadrozzi Jr., a New York concrete magnate who owns the Gowanus Bay Terminal. Quadrozzi has access to a 1,300-foot space where the ship could be docked. Dredging of the channel would be required before the ship could be accomodated, however.

The plan to move the ship to Red Hook is not new. Almost a decade ago, we posted about [a proposal to move the ship to Gowanus Bay Terminal](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/10/a-new-home-in-red-hook-brooklyn-for-the-ss-united-states/) that never came to fruition.

The coalition has organized a [petition drive](https://www.change.org/p/last-call-save-the-ss-united-states-say-no-to-reefing-brooklyn-or-bust?recruiter=1365688220&recruited_by_id=23c035d0-ed5f-11ef-a3a7-35afff6fa0a5&utm_source=share_petition&utm_campaign=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_content=cl_sharecopy_490437742_en-US%3A9) and a [gofundme page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/last-chance-rescue-the-legendary-ss-united-states-from-sink?attribution_id=sl:eb433606-4e26-497c-9934-623182950923&lang=en_AU&utm_campaign=man_ss_icons&utm_medium=customer&utm_source=copy_link). So far they have raised $4,275 and gotten 3,730 signatures. They have also posted an open letter asking [President Trump](https://www.nycsavessus.org/open-letter-to-president) to intervene to save the ship as well as an open letter to the [commissioners of Okaloosa County](https://www.nycsavessus.org/open-letter-to-okaloosa) asking them to change their plans.
