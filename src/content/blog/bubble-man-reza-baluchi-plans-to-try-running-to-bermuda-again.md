Baluchi in his bubble

As [we posted earlier this month](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/10/after-coast-guard-rescue-reza-baluchi-says-i-want-my-bubble-back/), Reza Baluchi, an extreme runner, attempted to run the almost 1,000 miles from Florida to Bermuda in a sort of bubble — an inflatable cylinder with a metal frame, that looked sort of like a clear hamster wheel.  Not surprisingly, he made it about 70 miles before he needed rescue by the US Coast Guard.  The rescue cost taxpayers roughly $144,000.   Incredibly, it now appears that Baluchi is going to attempt the same lame stunt again. From his [website](http://www.runwithreza.org/index.php):

*Reza plans to save money, design a 4th generation bubble and return to Miami to bubble across the Bermuda triangle again in January.   His 4th generation bubble  will be his best design yet.  He’s going to make it faster with 4″ deep fins that will propel through the water quicker, especially with the 28 soccer balls he will stick between the frames that wrap around the circumference of the bubble.*

The Bermuda Royal Gazette is reporting that the US Coast Guard this is saying that if he makes the attempt again, the [‘Bubble Man’ is on his own](http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20141029/NEWS/141029620).

*Lt Cmdr Gabe Somma told The Royal Gazette: “The Coast Guard has a proud history of providing lifesaving service to mariners in distress. However, we will not unnecessarily risk the lives of our Coast Guard men and women.*

*“To date, no one from Mr Baluchi’s team has contacted the Coast Guard. If Mr Baluchi intends to attempt another hydro-pod adventure on the high seas, he will need to meet with the Captain of the Port to provide his plan for vessel escort and self-rescue plans before departing.”*

“*As part of our dedicated service to this nation, we are obligated to ensure taxpayer money and resources are used efficiently and appropriately,” Lt Cmdr Somma added.*

For better or worse, I doubt that the US Coast Guard would refuse to rescue Baluchi, or anyone else, if need be. With luck, however, they might succeed in stopping him from leaving port.
