Depending on what one reads, the oil spill associated with the grounding of the *MV Rena* on Astrolabe Reef off Tauranga, New Zealand is either a “[small leak](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/grounded-container-ship-rena-leaks-oil-off-new-zealand-port-of-tauranga/story-e6frf7jx-1226159856344)” or a “[looming environmental disaster](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&objectid=10757140).”  Conceivably, depending on the integrity of the ship’s hull, both may be right.

The [Herald Sun](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/grounded-container-ship-rena-leaks-oil-off-new-zealand-port-of-tauranga/story-e6frf7jx-1226159856344) reports that “*salvage company representatives had reported the leak and said it had been stopped with only a small amount going into the water,*”  while the [NZ Herald](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&objectid=10757140) reports that the “*ship is haemorrhaging oil into the sea off Tauranga*.”  [Radio New Zealand](http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/87511/grounded-ship-leaking-oil-declared-hazardous) is reporting somewhere between the two other reports, noting that “*Maritime New Zealand believes the fuel tanks are still intact and heavy fuel oil leaking from the vessel appears to be from pipes. It is not clear how much has leaked into the sea.*”  
  
The major danger appears to be if the ship breaks up. Two holds are reported to be breached. A portion of the hull is firmly on the reef while the rest of the hull is in deep water.  The reef is in the Bay of Plenty and the areas is known for its “*marine life, including whales, dolphins, seals, sharks and rarities such as turtles, sunfish and whale sharks*.”   Four oiled dead birds have been found in the water near the stranded container ship.
