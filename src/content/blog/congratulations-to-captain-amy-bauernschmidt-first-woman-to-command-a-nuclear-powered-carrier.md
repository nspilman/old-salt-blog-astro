Amy Bauernschmidt](https://www.surfpac.navy.mil/Leaders/Biography/Article/2395913/captain-amy-n-bauernschmidt/) is now the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier [USS Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Abraham_Lincoln_\(CVN-72\)#:~:text=USS%20Abraham%20Lincoln%20\(CVN%2D72\)%20is%20the%20fifth%20Nimitz,the%20United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet.) — becoming the first woman to lead a nuclear carrier in U.S. Navy history.

Bauernschmidt, who previously served as the carrier’s executive officer from 2016-2019, relieved Capt. Walt “Sarge” Slaughter of his duties Aug. 19 during a change of command ceremony in San Diego, as reported by the [Navy Times](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2021/08/20/this-navy-captain-is-now-the-first-woman-commanding-a-nuclear-aircraft-carrier/). 

“There is no more humbling sense of responsibility than to know you are entrusted with the care of the people who have chosen to protect our nation,” Bauernschmidt said, according to a Navy news release. “Thank you, Capt. Slaughter, for turning over the finest ship in the fleet.”
