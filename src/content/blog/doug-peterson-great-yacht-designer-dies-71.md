Doug Peterson

[Doug Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Peterson), one of the most talented yacht designers of our time, has [died at 71 of cancer](http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-doug-peterson-20170627-story.html). He may be best remembered for his America’s Cup designs, as one of the lead designers of the winning 1992 *America3* and 1995 Team New Zealand [*Black Magic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NZL_32).  Peterson was elected into the America’s Cup Hall of Fame earlier this year. 

Beyond the America’s Cup, however, Peterson made his mark in both racing and cruising sailboat designs. In 1973, at the age of 28, his design for the One-Tonner *Ganbare* caught the sailing world’s attention.  He went on to design a series of custom racing boats which dominated offshore racing in the 70s. Peterson’s cruising designs, which combined seaworthiness and speed, included the Peterson 44 and Hans Christian 48 and 52.
