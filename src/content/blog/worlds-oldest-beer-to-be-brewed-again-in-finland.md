![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/beer.jpg)The “World’s Oldest Beer” to be will soon be brewed again by an Åland brewery in Finland.  In 2010, we [posted about the discovery in a shipwreck](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/09/baltic-shipwreck-with-worlds-oldest-champagne-and-now-the-worlds-oldest-beer/) in the Baltic off Finland’s Åland archipelago which contained what was believed to be several bottles of the [worlds oldest champagne](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/07/worlds-oldest-champagne-found-on-baltic-seabed/) and five bottles of the world’s oldest beer.  Both the champagne and the beer are believed to date from the 1780s.  A [bottle of the Veuve Clicquot champagne subsequently sold](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/the-worlds-oldest-champagne-sells-at-auction-for-less-than-predicted/) at auction for 30,000 euros ($43,500.)

The beer recovered from the wreck has been analysed by the Technical Research Centre of Finland. The analysis is being used by the Stallhagen brewery to recreate the beer.  The new “shipwreck” brew is expected to hit the shelves in time for summer 2014. A portion of the proceeds from each sale will go to support “marine archaeological research as well as conservation programmes to improve the quality of the marine environment,” according to Johan Ehn, Culture Minister in the Åland government.
