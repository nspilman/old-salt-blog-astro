![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/japnessubdamage.jpg)Sailors on the Japanese submarine [*Soryu*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JS_S%C5%8Dry%C5%AB_\(SS-501\)) had to use their cell phones to call for help after the sub surfaced beneath a Chinese bulk carrier and damaged its radio mast, disabling its communications. Three of the submarine’s crew sustained minor injuries in the crash, which occurred on Monday, government officials said. 

From photos provided by Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force, the vessel also suffered damage to its diving planes. The bulk carrier, identified as the Hong Kong-registered 93,000 dwt [*MV Ocean Artemis*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/OCEAN-ARTEMIS-IMO-9534987-MMSI-477814500), was not damaged. Crew on the bulker are reporting not to have felt the impact of the collision.

[Japan’s defence minister said the collision](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56000531#:~:text=Three%20of%20the%20submarine's%20crew,phone%20to%20report%20the%20incident) off Kochi prefecture was “extremely regrettable”. Nobuo Kishi said the *Soryu* was on a training exercise when the incident occurred. The submarine saw the vessel through its periscope but was unable to move in time.

The *Soryu* is a diesel-electric submarine commissioned in 2009.  
   
The 84-meter (275ft) long submarine was still able to continue sailing as the damage was not major according to Japanese officials.

Bradley Martin, a former US navy captain, disputes the characterization. He told [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/08/asia/japan-submarine-collision-intl-hnk-scli/index.html): “I wouldn’t call the damage ‘minor’. The submarine can’t dive and can’t communicate.”

Except, apparently, by cell phone.
