![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hurricanes.jpg)Two monster storms are bearing down on vulnerable coastlines on opposite sides of the globe. In the Atlantic,  [Hurricane Florence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/09/13/the-water-is-the-devil-hurricane-florence-roars-closer-to-the-southeast-with-punishing-rain-wind/?utm_term=.5e783859aee5), now a Category 2 storm, is sending lashing winds, powerful rains and the threat of major flooding as it approaches the coast of the Carolinas. In the Pacific, [Super Typhoon Mangkhut](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/12/asia/super-typhoon-ompong-mangkhut-wxc-intl/index.html) is still gathering strength as it nears the northern Philippines. With winds of 180 mph, Mangkhut is equivalent to a Category 5 Hurricane. It is expected to make landfall on Luzon island Saturday.

“All things being equal, Mangkhut is a bigger, stronger and more dangerous storm” than Florence, said [CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/12/asia/super-typhoon-ompong-mangkhut-wxc-intl/index.html). “Any land hit directly would see more significant and destructive impacts from the Super Typhoon due to its size and intensity.”

However, he added that the extent of the destruction caused by a hurricane or typhoon depends on what it hits, and the US east coast is “much more populated with significantly more infrastructure to damage.”

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/12/asia/super-typhoon-ompong-mangkhut-wxc-intl/index.html) also quotes Richard Gordon, chairman of the Philippines Red Cross. “We’re worried for the 10 million people in the Philippines living in the path of this destructive storm, including those who have been displaced several times due to the monsoon rains last July and August,” he said in a statement. “We are preparing our emergency assets and relief items. Our staff and volunteers are on high alert for possible deployment.”

A [recent study](https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/09/11/category-climate-change-may-cause-more-hurricanes-rapidly-intensify/?utm_term=.af92f4e30cc2) suggests that climate change is resulting in larger and more dangerous hurricanes.
