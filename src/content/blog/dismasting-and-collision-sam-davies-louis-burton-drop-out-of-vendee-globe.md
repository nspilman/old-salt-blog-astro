After only a week into the [Vendée Globe](http://www.vendeeglobe.org) non-stop round-the-world single-handed yacht race, four of the twenty original sailors have dropped out due to casualties or gear failure. The latest include [Louis Burton](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/news/article/3405/louis-burton-abandons.html), who was in a  collision with a fishing boat off Portugal, and [Samantha Davies](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/news/article/3413/sam-davies-i-could-hear-the-mast-rubbing-against-the-hull.html) whose boat suffered a dismasting last night.  Previously, [Kito de Pavant](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skipper/2/kito-de-pavant.html) also [withdrew from the race following a collision with another fishing boat](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/11/12/kito-de-pavant-hit-by-fishing-boat-retires-from-vendee-globe/). [Marc Guillemot was forced to withdraw](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/11/11/marc-guillemot-on-safran-retirees-from-vendee-globe-with-broken-keel-after-one-days-racing/) after the keel on his boat *Safran* broke on the first day of the race.
