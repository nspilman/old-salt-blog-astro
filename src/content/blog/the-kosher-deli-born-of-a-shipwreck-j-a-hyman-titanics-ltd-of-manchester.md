![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/29032012-jahandmrs.jpg)This story is so unlikely that it must be true.  When the [Collapsible Lifeboat C from the *RMS Titanic*](http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/boat/C/) was picked up by the *Carpathia*, of the 41 aboard, there were two very different men, though their names, by virtue of alphabetization are adjacent to each other on the list of survivors –  [Joseph Abraham Hyman,](http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/abraham-hyman.html) 34, a third class passenger, and [Joseph Bruce Ismay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Bruce_Ismay), the chairman of the White Star Line, traveling in first class.  Despite their difference in social standing, both reportedly help row the lifeboat.

The sinking of the *Titanic* ruined Ismay.  Joseph Hyman did somewhat better. He was traveling to visit his brother in in New Jersey to start a new life.  His family stayed behind in England and planned on joining him once he was established.  After arriving in America, however, Joseph Hyman decided to return to Britain. (It is said, understandably, that he required a sizable quantity of alcohol before he could bring himself to board another ship.)  On his return, he decided to set up a kosher delicatessen like the ones that he had seen in New York.  And that is exactly what he did. In 1913 he established J.A.Hyman – Kosher Butcher and Deli in Manchester, England.

Of course, it was never known as J.A.Hyman’s.  It was always called by its customers, Titanics.  
  
The store is still still there.  [J.A.Hyman (Titanics) Ltd](http://www.titanics.co.uk/index.html) is now in its 4th generation.  Richard, Josephs’ great grandson now runs the business.
