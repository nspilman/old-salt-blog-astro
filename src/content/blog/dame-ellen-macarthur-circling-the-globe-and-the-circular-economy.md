In 2005, [Ellen MacArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_MacArthur) broke the world record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe, sailing 27,354 nautical miles in 71 days, 14 hours, 18 minutes 33 seconds at an average speed of of 15.9 knots. Recently she gave a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/) about the perspective that she gained sailing around the world alone. She returned with new insights into the way the world works, as a place of interlocking cycles and finite resources, where the decisions we make today affect what’s left for tomorrow. She proposes a bold new way to see the world’s economic systems: not as linear, but as circular, where everything comes around.
