![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/11/humpback1.jpg)The Trump administration announced that it would [cancel a rule designed to protect whales and turtles](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-trump-marine-mammals-20170612-story.html), which was first implemented in 2016, at the request of the fishing industry. The rule helped limit the number of endangered whales and turtles ensnared in fishing nets and had been recommended by the 14-member [Pacific Fishery Management Council](https://www.pcouncil.org/), which manages fisheries in California, Oregon, and Washington, in 2015. The rule applies only to the 20 gill-net fishing vessels still operating on the West Coast. The measure protected endangered fin, humpback, and sperm whales; short-finned pilot whales and common bottlenose dolphins; as well as endangered leatherback sea turtles, loggerhead sea turtles, olive ridley sea turtles and green sea turtles. The Trump administration has declared that the protection is unnecessary. 

“The Trump administration has declared war on whales, dolphins, and turtles off the coast of California,” said Todd Steiner, director of the [Turtle Island Restoration Network](https://seaturtles.org/), which is based in Northern California. “This determination will only lead to more potential litigation and legislation involving this fishery. It’s not a good sign.”
