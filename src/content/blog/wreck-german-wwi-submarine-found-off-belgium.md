German type UBII Submarine

The almost intact wreck of a German submarine that sank during World War I has been located in the North Sea off Belgium, in 98 feet of water. The type [UB-II submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Type_UB_II_submarine) is said to be in good condition, with its hatches sealed, leading officials to believe that the bodies of the crew of up to 23 may still be inside the wreck. [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41318195) quotes West Flanders Governor Carl Decaluwé saying, “The submarine is in such good condition that we reckon all the bodies are still on board.”

The submarine suffered significant bow damage and is thought to have been sunk by a mine. Mr. Decaluwé told reporters that the location of the wreck was being kept secret to prevent the submarine being looted or damaged.
