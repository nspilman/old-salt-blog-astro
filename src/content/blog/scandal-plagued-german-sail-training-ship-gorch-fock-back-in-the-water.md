![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gorshfolkII.jpg)The German Navy sail training ship [*Gorch Fock*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorch_Fock_\(1958\)) is finally back in the water after a lengthy repair/rebuilding, plagued by scandal and extraordinary cost overruns. Delivered in 1958, she is a near-sister vessel of the original ship of the same name commissioned in 1933. The ship is often referred to unofficially as the *Gorch Fock II* to distinguish her from her older sister ship.

Depending on who you ask the training ship is either the “pride of the German Navy” or an ongoing embarrassment. The [Berlin Spectator](https://berlinspectator.com/2019/03/01/germany-the-never-ending-problems-with-a-sailing-vessel/) took the later view when it noted that “replacing the second ‘o’ in ‘Gorch Fock’ with a ‘u’ will show what many Germans think of the scandals surrounding the vessel.”

From 2008 through 2011, a series of controversies arose related to crew safety, a [near mutiny](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/mutiny-on-the-gorch-fock/), and allegations of [sexual harassment](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/was-the-gorch-fock-%e2%80%9cgermany%e2%80%99s-largest-floating-brothel%e2%80%9d/), that resulted in the [captain being suspended](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/commander-of-gorch-fock-dismissed-ship-ordered-home/). (All charges were later dropped.)  

Then in 2015, the *Gorch Fock* entered Elsflether shipyard in Germany for basic repairs, with an estimated cost of 10 million Euros. Before the ship was back in the water over five years later, [the cost had exploded to 135 million Euros.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/01/cost-explosion-on-repair-of-german-training-ship-gorch-foch/) The shipyard has since gone bankrupt and is the subject of several sets of [investigations alleging corruption and mismanagement](https://newsarticleinsiders.com/allegations-of-corruption-against-officials-raid-on-the-gorch-fock-shipyard).

The ship has undergone a major restoration. The hull has been almost entirely replated. A recent audit report describes how an economic feasibility study was never been conducted for the repair work. On top of it all, the ministry never tried to establish whether having a new ship built would have been cheaper, according to the Audit Office.

For the sake of comparison, a new, larger training ship, the [BAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAP_Uni%C3%B3n) *Unión,* was delivered to the Peruvian Navy in 2016 for an estimated construction cost of [50-60 million Euros](https://miami.curbed.com/2016/9/19/12971880/bap-union-saling-ship-miami). 

Additional outfitting work is underway on *Gorch Fock II*.  Her first new training voyage is expected to [commence in July of this year](https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/schleswig-holstein/Gorch-Fock-Kommandant-Grossartiger-Moment,gorchfock2334.html).
