The [schooner *Zodiac*](https://schoonerzodiac.com/) was built in 1924 for the heirs to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. After a successful career as a private yacht, winning many races and passing through several owners, the *Zodiac* was purchased by the San Francisco Bar Pilots Association in 1931. Renamed *California*, she operated as a pilot schooner on San Francisco Bay until 1972, the last sailing pilot vessel in the United States.

She was purchased and restored by a community of shipwrights, sailors, and historians who formed the Vessel Zodiac Corporation and operate her as a charter vessel from her homeport in Bellingham, WA. The Zodiac was added to the National Register of Historic Places by act of Congress in 1982.
