**UPDATE**:  The Canadian government is now treating the casualty as an attempt at human smuggling.  [Toews links N.S. yacht accident to ‘human smuggling’](http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120327/search-and-rescue-as-yacht-drifts-south-of-cape-sable-island-nova-scotia-120327/)

There are reports of a tragic and strange sailboat accident off Canada’s Nova Scotia coast.  Nine men, reported to be from Eastern Europe, were on a 35 foot sailboat, the *Tabasco 2*, which became disabled and was drifting in high seas, 148 kilometres south of Cape Sable Island.  Three of the sailboat’s crew are reported to be missing. One man is reported to have died.

Three of the sailboat’s crew were picked up by a passing tanker, the *[FSL Hamburg](http://www.uptankers.com/ship-fsl-hamburg.html)*.  Three other hypothermic and injured crew members were helicoptered to Yarmouth Regional Hospital.  One of the three died in transit. The other two are said to be in  serious condition.   A Canadian Cormorant helicopter and a Hercules aircraft were involved in the rescue with refueling support from a U.S. Coast Guard jet.
