![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sunkennorfrigate.jpg)On November 8, just after 4 AM, the Norwegian navy frigate, [KNM *Helge Ingstad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNoMS_Helge_Ingstad_\(F313\)), collided with the Maltese flag, Aframax tanker, [*Sola TS*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/248020000), near the Sture terminal in the Hjeltefjord near Bergen, Norway. The night was clear. Local traffic control and the tanker both communicated with the frigate by radio. The frigate’s radar and AIS receiver were operational and yet the frigate cut across the bow of the tanker, resulting in the collision. The tanker was traveling at around 6 knots, while the frigate was [operating at 17-18 knots](https://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/265809/helge-ingstads-crew-were-unaware-sola-ts-was-a-moving-object/). Eight sailors aboard the frigate suffered minor injuries but the frigate subsequently sank.

What happened? The [Accident Investigation Board Norway has issued a preliminary report](https://www.aibn.no/Marine/Investigations/18-968) answering at least some of the many questions surrounding the collision. 

### How could this have happened?

The simple answer is that the frigate did not recognize the tanker *Sola TS* as a ship. The watch officers on the KNM *Helge Ingstad* thought the object ahead was fixed, presumably part of the oil terminal. Instead, the two vessels were moving toward each other at around 23 knots. The more than 17-knot speed of the frigate also reduced the time available for the tanker and for traffic control to react.

### Why didn’t the frigate identify the tanker?

The lights at the Sture terminal were bright in the early hours of the morning, making it harder to see other ships. As the frigate was approaching the terminal, the *Sola TS*  was still alongside the dock and presumably blended in against the background. When the tanker got underway, it left its deck lights on, which probably meant that it continued to blend in and could have made it harder to see its running lights.

But, the frigate still had radar and AIS. There were at least three other ships in the channel just prior to the collision. Depending on the radar and AIS displays the *Sola TS* could have been overlooked.

### What about radio communication?

The *Helge Ingstad* was not broadcasting its AIS position until shortly before the collision, which caused a delay in identifying the frigate by the local traffic control and the tanker.  When the frigate was contacted by *Sola TS* and told to change course immediately, the captain of the frigate responded. The radio transcript is not clear but suggests that he thought that such a turn would send them either into traffic or towards the rocks. Apparently, he did not plan to change course until they passed the fixed object dead ahead, which was, in fact, the tanker *Sola TS* moving at them at 6 knots.
