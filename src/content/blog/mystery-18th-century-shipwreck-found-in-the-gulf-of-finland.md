I am always amazed by how well darkness, cold and a lack of oxygen can preserve a wooden ship wreck.   Thanks to [Badewanne](http://www.badewanne.fi/index.shtml), a non-profit group of divers that has been documenting shipwrecks in the Gulf of Finland for more than 15 years, we have a close up of an as yet unidentified 18th century ship wreck.   The wreck is more than 60 meters (over 200 feet)  down and is in remarkably good condition.

[A mystery 18th century shipwreck found in the Gulf of Finland – documentation reveals pristine details](http://www.badewanne.fi/press/release_20110412.html)

*The wreck has 12 gun ports on one deck, with six guns still present in their original positions. Whether more guns were present or if they were taken over board in an effort to save her at the time of her sinking is unknown. In addition to deck guns, other details lying on the deck include remains of ropes, buckets, remains of a steering wheel and stock of a rifle. Ship’s figurehead, a man figure, is lying on the seabed, just under the bow. Hatchways on gun deck are open, and remains of a barrel and pieces of wood are visible in the silt underneath them. The documentation work by wreck research team Badewanne has been completely non-intrusive, utmost care has been taken to protect this pristine discovery.*

*Despite research effort, the ship’s identity remains a mystery. Ship’s bell is still in its place, and if raised and preserved, it might eventually reveal the wreck’s identity. But at this stage the Finnish National Board of Antiquities is not planning a lifting operation.*

*“With this release we hope that the material will ring the bell amongst the marine historians and researchers in Sweden, Russia, United Kingdom and other countries active in the area some 200 years ago, so that the identity of the wreck would be finally revealed”, says Jussi Kaasinen from the wreck research team Badewanne.*
