Located directly across the river from Lower Manhattan, Water’s Soul depicts the serene face of a young woman holding a finger to her lips in silent contemplation.

“Water is a marvelous metaphor for humanity,” Plensa said. “One drop of water is quite alone, like a single person, but many drops together can create a tidal wave, and form immense rivers and oceans. When individuals come together to exchange ideas and create community, we can build something incredibly powerful.”

The pier is now open for year-round public access, located in Newport, a mixed-use development in Jersey City.

“It is my wish for Water’s Soul to become an icon for Newport and a landmark that visually connects it with New York City across the Hudson River,” Plensa said. “Just as Water’s Soul acts to unite the city of Jersey City and New York City, we are reminded that water is the great public space that unites and embraces communities as well as people around the world.”

Born in Barcelona where he currently lives and works, Plensa is one of the world’s foremost sculptors in the public realm with celebrated projects spanning the globe in New York, Calgary, Chicago, San Diego, Montreal, Los Angeles, London, Dubai, Bangkok, Shanghai, and Tokyo.

Water’s Soul is the artist’s tallest public sculpture to date.
