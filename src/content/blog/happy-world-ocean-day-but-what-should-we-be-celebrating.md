One fish, two fish, dead fish, no fish?

Today is the second annual celebration of [World Ocean Day](http://www.theoceanproject.org/wod/)!  The only thing that is unclear to me is what and how we should be celebrating.  From the [World Oceans’ Day website](http://www.theoceanproject.org/wod/wod_wearblue.php):

*“In 2009 The Ocean Project started an annual tradition associated with World Oceans Day. We launched “Wear Blue and Tell Two” as a new way of celebrating our world’s ocean on June 8th.*

*The main idea behind “Wear Blue and Tell Two” is to have people associate the color blue with World Oceans Day each year. We also are interested in helping each person multiply their positive reach by telling friends or colleagues two interesting facts about the ocean or ways one can take take personal action to help.”*  
  
The United States is in the middle of what is sure to be the worst offshore environmental disaster  in our history.  Somehow the official slogan, “[Wear Blue and Tell Two](http://www.theoceanproject.org/wod/wod_wearblue.php)”  and [readings of Dr. Suez’s classic “](http://www.local12.com/news/local/story/World-Ocean-Day/LzFcR5OYdEq6lB1iwH6kvA.cspx)*[One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish”](http://www.local12.com/news/local/story/World-Ocean-Day/LzFcR5OYdEq6lB1iwH6kvA.cspx)* seem at best a bit silly.   (2010 is the 50th anniversary of a favorite children’s book [*One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375841660?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375841660) by Dr. Seuss.)  I guess cute slogans and rhyming kids’ books can’t do any harm.  The observance of  “[Earth Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day)” on April 22nd was inspired by the Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969.   Perhaps, one day,we will look back at the Deepwater Horizon disaster as the event that triggered real change in our attitude toward energy and the oceans. I am not feeling optimistic, but I hope I am wrong.
