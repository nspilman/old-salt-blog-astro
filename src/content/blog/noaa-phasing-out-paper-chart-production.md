![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NOAApapercharts.jpg)When I bought my new-to-me old boat, I bought several booklets of paper charts covering the waters from the Chesapeake to Maine. Over the last few years, I have never used them. Never, not once. Instead, I have chart plotters on a laptop, two tablets, and my phone. My paper charts have stayed buried at the bottom of the cabinet beneath the chart table. Nevertheless, I still had mixed feelings when I read that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA ) is phasing out the production of traditional paper nautical charts.

[NOAA announced in the Federal Register of November 15, 2019](https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/updates/noaa-seeks-public-comment-on-ending-production-of-traditional-paper-nautical-charts/?fbclid=IwAR2nlLRW2An3lA5vfwPscegEDS9iYU08G33rKFix6v9JspOr47ZNkCsKZss), that it is initiating a five-year process to end all traditional paper nautical chart production and is seeking the public’s feedback on the program.

NOAA is not getting out of the chart business. It is simply moving to fully electronic navigational charts (ENCs). The good news is that NOAA is working to improve the ENCs that they provide. From their announcement:

*NOAA is in the midst of a multi-year program to improve its ENC coverage by replacing over 1,200 irregularly shaped ENC cells, compiled in over 130 different scales, with a standard gridded layout of ENCs, compiled in just a dozen standard scales. This will increase the number of ENC cells to about 9,000 and significantly improve the level of detail and consistency among ENCs. More information about improvements being made is in [Transforming the NOAA ENC®](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/docs/enc-transformation.pdf).*

Better ECNs are all well and good but shouldn’t we have paper backups? NOAA will, for example, no longer be providing, among other chart services, print-on-demand (POD) paper nautical charts or full-size chart PDFs. 

NOAA has a plan to allow customized paper chart products based on ENC data. They are developing a NOAA Custom Chart (NCC) prototype from which “*Users may define the scale and paper size of custom-made nautical charts centered on a position of their choosing. NCC then creates a geospatially referenced Portable Document Format (GeoPDF) image of a nautical chart. Chart notes and other marginalia are placed on a separate PDF page. Users may then download, view, and print the output. NCC is an easy way to create a paper or digital backup for electronic chart systems or other Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled chart displays.*” 

As I lack a large flatbed printer, the statement that “*NCC is an easy way to create a paper or digital backup*” seems arguable.  On the other hand, given that I have never used my current paper charts for anything other than providing peace of mind, perhaps digital backups will be enough.
