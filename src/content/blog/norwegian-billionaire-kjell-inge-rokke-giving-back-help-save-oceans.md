Norwegian Billionaire [Kjell Inge Røkke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kjell_Inge_R%C3%B8kke) has pledged to give away a substantial portion of his [US$ 3.8 billion fortune](https://www.forbes.com/profile/kjell-inge-rokke/) to fund efforts to help save the world’s oceans. Last May, he announced the construction of a [596′ long state-of-the-art ice-strengthened oceanographic research expedition vessel](http://rosellinisfour-10.no/), which will be operated in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund ([WWF](https://www.worldwildlife.org/).) The ship is scheduled to be launched in the summer of 2020.  Reportedly, the ship will be the world’s largest of its type, able to carry 60 scientists and 40 crew, and will have the ability to remove up to five tons of plastic daily from the ocean and melt it down for recycling.

In February, [his organization announced a plan](http://rosellinisfour-10.no/publications/plan-launched-to-build-world-ocean-headquarters-at-fornebu) to build a World Ocean Headquarters at Fornebu, Norway. The goal in establishing the facility is to “*bring together knowledge-based institutions related to such as sustainable fisheries and ocean management, shipping, marine technology, aquaculture, laboratories, science, research and NGOs to improve the state of our ocean*.” 

Røkke was born in Molde, a small town on Norway’s west coast. Suffering from dyslexia, he dropped out of high school at 18 and traveled to the United States to work on fishing trawlers in Alaska.  He began buying old fishing boats and would, in time, establish the [American Seafoods Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Seafoods), one of the largest seafood companies in North America. 

While in his mid-30s, Røkke returned to Norway and began to invest in [Aker ASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aker_ASA), a Norwegian holding company involved in offshore fishing, construction, and engineering. In 1996, he acquired a controlling interest in the firm. He currently owns roughly a 67% interest in the publically traded firm.

[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/profile/kjell-inge-rokke/) reported that Røkke has “earned a reputation as a ruthless corporate raider” throughout his career.  Reuters referred to Røkke as “*Norway’s gigantomaniac tycoon*.”  

“He was the first one to bring American-style, aggressive capitalism to Norway, daring to use shareholder power to get what he wanted,” Steinar Dyrnes, a journalist who wrote a biography of Røkke, told Reuters.

However aggressive he has been in his business ventures, Røkke apparently thinks that it is time he gave back a significant part of his fortune. In May 2107, Røkke and his wife joined the [Gates-Buffett –The Giving Pledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Pledge), where he promised to devote the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes during their lifetimes or after their death.

Røkke explains, “*I am a fisherman, and curious by nature. Resources in the oceans and on the seabed have provided significant value for society – and also for my family and myself. For this, I am very grateful*….

*“Marine life – both above and below the surface – has fascinated me since my childhood growing up in Molde, Norway. The idea of an ocean-going research and expedition vessel is* *therefore something that has been on my mind for many years. This vessel will be a platform for learning, sharing knowledge, improving understanding and developing forward-looking solutions for the benefit of future generations.”*
