![xuelong](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/12/xuelong.jpg)The Chinese icebreaker [*Xue Long*, or *Snow Dragon*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Xue_Long), has gotten to within around 6-7 miles of the expedition cruise ship,  [MV Akademik Shokalskiy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademik_Shokalskiy), before it too was stopped by thick ice off the coast of Antarctica, south of Tasmania. Three icebreakers were dispatched to rescue the stricken cruise ship. Unfortunately, the Chinese *Snow Dragon* is the largest and most powerful of the three and it is stuck in the ice.

A second icebreaker, the French icebreaking research vessel, [*L’Astrolabe*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_icebreaker_Astrolabe), is close by, but as it is a considerably smaller ship with less horsepower, may not be able to provide much assistance to the *Snow Dragon*.  The third icebreaker, the Australian *[Aurora Australis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Australis_\(icebreaker\)),* is also on its way to the trapped ships. Unfortunately, while she is more powerful than  *L’Astrolabe, *Aurora Australis** is still less than half the displacement and three quarters the horsepower of the *Snow Dragon*.

The best answer may be a wind shift. “*Right now we are waiting for winds to blow ice away so we can move closer*,” Capt. Wang Jiangzhong of the Snow Dragon told [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/27/world/antarctica-ship-stuck/). “*The current ice condition is exceeding our capabilities to break through further.*“
