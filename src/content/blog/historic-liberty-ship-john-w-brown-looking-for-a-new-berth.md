![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/12/jownwbrown.jpg)Of the more than 2,700 Liberty ships built during World War II, only two are still operational in the United States. One, the John W. Brown, now docked in Baltimore, may become homeless when its five-year agreement for free berthing at Rukert Terminals’ Pier C in Canton, Maryland expires at the end of next September.

The [Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-fe-john-w-brown-20181120-story.html) quotes, Richard Bauman, 65, a retired ship pilot for the state of Maryland who serves as captain and master of the John W. Brown, saying “We’ve spent a good bit of time looking for a new, permanent home, but we haven’t really had a whole lot of luck.  They’re not going to throw us out, but they run a business, and they would like to have us find a place where we can stay permanently.”

Officials with Project Liberty Ship say all parties are working to find a permanent home.

“We wish them well, and we told them we’ll work with them,” says Rukert CEO Norman Rukert Jr. “We’re not going to say on Oct. 1 that they have to go.”

The Baltimore Sun also notes, that finding a permanent home won’t be easy. Fewer than a dozen commercial piers in the area are large enough to handle the ship, said Michael Barnes, a member of the nonprofit’s board.

The John W. Brown operates on a budget of about $1 million a year, Barnes said, almost all raised through donations and fees. Project Liberty Ship officials figure it would have cost about $15,000 a month to rent the Canton pier, and they’re expecting to spend about that much, possibly more, for a new space. They’re even willing to consider purchasing a pier, Barnes said.

“The bottom line is: We really don’t expect anybody to give us a free pier,” he said.
