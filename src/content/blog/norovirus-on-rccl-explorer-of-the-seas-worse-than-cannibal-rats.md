![explorer2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/explorer2.jpg)My next door neighbors left last Tuesday for a 10 day cruise in the Eastern Caribbean on the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line ship *[Explorer of the Seas](http://www.royalcaribbean.com/findacruise/ships/class/ship/home.do?shipCode=EX).*  I saw them shortly before they departed.  We were both shoveling snow from our front sidewalks.  The *Explorer of the Seas* would be sailing from New York in a winter snow storm and my neighbor commented that at the very least it would be “a memorable trip.” It turns out that this voyage will be memorable for reasons other than weather.  It is now being reported that [close to 600 of the more than 3,000 passengers have been sickened by a norovirus](http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/surv/outbreak/2014/january21_explorer_seas.htm) aboard the ship.  The cruise schedule was modified and now has been shortened.  The ship is on her way back to a berth in Bayonne in New York harbor.  I only hope my neighbors were among the roughly 80% of the passengers not made ill by the virus.

The norovirus is a highly contagious organism that causes vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, fever, and stomach pain.   It is spread by individuals infected by the virus, through contaminated food or water and by contact with contaminated surfaces. According to the [Center for Disease Control (CDC)](http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/overview.html), *“norovirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States. Each year, it causes 19-21 million illnesses and contributes to 56,000-71,000 hospitalizations and 570-800 deaths. Norovirus is also the most common cause of foodborne-disease outbreaks in the United States.*”

This is norovirus season. While there can be outbreaks at any time during the year, the CDC reports that more than 80% of the outbreaks occur from November to April.  Noroviruses can spread on land or sea but are particularly nasty in the confined spaces of a cruise ship. The [CDC maintains a database of outbreaks on cruise ships](http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/surv/gilist.htm#2014) where more than 3% of those aboard become sick with the virus.  All of the major cruise lines have been hit by the norovirus, although the outbreak on the *Explorer of the Seas* is especially severe with close 20% of the passengers being made ill. 

The norovirus is indeed worse than cannibal rats, as the rats were an April Fool’s joke that went viral, whereas the norovirus is no laughing matter.
