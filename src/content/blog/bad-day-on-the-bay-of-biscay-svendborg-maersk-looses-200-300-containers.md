[![Svendborg_Maersk](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/02/Svendborg_Maersk.jpg)Maersk Lines](http://www.maerskline.com/en-us/countries/int/news/news-articles/2014/02/svendborg-maersk-incident) is reporting that the 7,200 TEU container ship [*Svendborg Maersk*](https://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Svendborg-Maersk-9146467.html) lost a “*significant number of containers over board*” on Friday while crossing the Bay of Biscay.   [Lloyds List](http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/sector/containers/article436978.ece) is reporting that 200-300 containers were lost in heavy weather while noting that the “full tally could be higher.”  The wind was reported to be blowing at 60 knots and waves were 10 meters high at the time of the loss.  Maersk say that “*Other containers onboard are damaged as a result of collapsed stacks.*”  The crew is reported to be safe and accounted for.  The 1998-built ship was said to have rolled 40 degrees in the severe weather.   The incident is believed to be the biggest container loss in a single incident ever suffered by Maersk Line. The *Svendborg Maersk* docked in port of Malaga on February 17, for container re-stowage and repairs to the ship.
