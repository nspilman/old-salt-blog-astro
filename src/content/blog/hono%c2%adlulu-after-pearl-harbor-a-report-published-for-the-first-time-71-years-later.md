In December of 1941, Betty McIntosh was a reporter for the Honolulu Star Bulletin. On December 7th, when the [United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii was attacked](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor), she was sent out by her editors to report from a “women’s point of view.”  The article she wrote went unpublished, however, because her editors thought that it was “too graphic” and would disturb her women readers. The article went unpublished for 71 years until the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/honolulu-after-pearl-harbor-a-report-published-for-the-first-time-71-years-later/2012/12/06/e9029986-3d69-11e2-bca3-aadc9b7e29c5_story.html) finally published it yesterday.  Ms. McIntosh went on to work as a spy for the ISS and the CIA. She is now 97 and still writing.
