[![INS_Sindhurakshak_(S63)](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/08/INS_Sindhurakshak_S63.jpg)A massive explosion, followed by a fire, has partially sunk](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/world/asia/explosion-partly-sinks-indian-naval-submarine.html?_r=0) the Indian Navy’s diesel electric submarine [INS *Sindhurakshak*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Sindhurakshak_\(S63\)) early this morning at the Mumbai naval dockyard. Eighteen officers and sailors were reported to be aboard at the time of the explosion and have not been accounted for. Indian Defense Minister A.K. Antony has alluded to fatalities, though there is no further word on the fate of the missing sailors. The blast on the *Sindhurakshak* is also reported to have done minor damage to another submarine docked nearby, the sister vessel, INS *Sindhuratna*. Both submarines are [Russian Kilo class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo-class_submarine) vessels.

The [INS *Sindhurakshak* had only recently returned from Russia](http://www.firstpost.com/india/sindhurakshak-fire-submarine-was-refitted-in-russia-1032311.html) following a two and a half year refit, overhaul and upgrade.  The retrofit followed a 2010 fire in which one sailor was killed and two others were injured. Navy officials reported that the fire had been caused by an explosion in the submarine’s battery compartment, which occured due to a faulty battery valve that leaked hydrogen gas.  There are [reports that the batteries on the *Sindhurakshak* were being charged](http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/1874239/report-many-sailors-feared-dead-in-fire-on-board-ins-sindhurakshak-rescue-operations-underway) at the time of the explosion.

The past week had marked several positive milestones for the Indian Navy.  Earlier this week, [India launched its first home-built aircraft carrier, INS](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-23662726) *[Vikrant](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-23662726),* and on Saturday announced that [INS *Arihant,* the first Indian-built nuclear submarine was ready for sea trials.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/08/india-joins-the-nuclear-sub-club-ins-arihant-first-indian-built-nuclear-sub-ready-for-sea-trials/)   The explosion on the *Sindhurakshak* is a reminder of the other side of the story in which the Indian Navy is aging, overextended and suffering from chronic problems with corruption in defense contracting.
