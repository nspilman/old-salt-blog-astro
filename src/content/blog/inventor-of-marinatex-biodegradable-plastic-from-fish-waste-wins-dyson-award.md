![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/11/marinatexhughes.jpg)Lucy Hughes, a 24-year-old recent engineering graduate of the University of Sussex has won this year’s [James Dyson Award](https://www.jamesdysonaward.org/en-US/) for developing a biodegradable plastic from fish waste — the fish scales, skins, and guts discarded from fish processing plants. The material, [MarinaTex](https://www.jamesdysonaward.org/2019/project/marinatex/), won Hughes the £30,000 (nearly $39,000) award, given to a recent design or engineering graduate who develops a product that solves a problem with ingenuity. Hughes beat out 1,078 entrants from 28 different countries.

[Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/bioplastic-made-from-fish-scales-just-won-james-dyson-award-180973550/?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=socialmedia&fbclid=IwAR3OWJvSUFl3vPJpnIGlm_M_oZg-wNXAWH04xwChVgGiWIz1_UI3T6rVMsQ) reports that MarinaTex is strong, flexible and translucent, with a feel similar to plastic sheeting. It biodegrades on its own in four to six weeks, which gives it a major sustainability [advantage over traditional bioplastics](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191030-why-biodegradables-wont-solve-the-plastic-crisis), most of which require industrial composters to break down. In addition to utilizing materials that would otherwise be thrown away, the production process itself uses little energy, since it doesn’t require hot temperatures. One single Atlantic codfish produces enough waste for 1,400 MarinaTex bags.
