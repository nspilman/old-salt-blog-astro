The Ady Gil is hit by Japanese ship Shonan Maru 2 and, inset, Peter Bethune, top, and Paul Watson.

Last January the power boat [*Ady Gil*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MY_Ady_Gil) was hit by the Japanese whaling ship, [*Shonan Maru 2*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Sh%C5%8Dnan_Maru_2), during the [Sea Shepherds](http://www.seashepherd.org/)‘ protest/[reality TV show](http://animal.discovery.com/tv/whale-wars/).  Who was responsible for the collision is still the subject of controversy. Now the captain of the *Ady Gil*, Pete Bethune, has resigned from the Sea Shepherds after accusing  Sea Shepherd Conservation Society Boss Paul Watson of lying about the sinking of the *Ady Gil*.  Bethune claims that Watson ordered the scuttling of the vessel following the collision.  Watson responded by claiming that Bethune lied in  his testimony in Japanese court

*Bethune has accused Watson of ordering him to sink the boat as a publicity stunt, and quit Sea Shepherd in disgust at the organisation’s antics.*

*Bethune says he has now quit the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, and is accusing the organisation of deliberately misleading the public.*

*However, Sea Shepherd says Bethune didn’t quit – he was fired for laying the blame on Watson when questioned by the Japanese authorities during his five-month incarceration.*

*Watson says Bethune’s testimony, pointing the finger at him, means there is now a warrant for his arrest in Japan and his name is on the Interpol Blue List, making travel between countries difficult.*

***WHAT SEA SHEPHERD SAYS***

*   *The Ady Gil sank while being towed to port after a collision with the Shonan Maru No 2.*
*   *Bethune broke Sea Shepherd’s non-violence policy by bringing a bow and arrow on board the Ady Gil.*
*   *Bethune’s initial expulsion from Sea Shepherd during his Japanese trial was a ploy to encourage a more lenient sentence.*
*   *Bethune’s false testimony to Japanese authorities reportedly led to the issue of an arrest warrant for Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson and his addition to Interpol’s “Blue List”.*
*   *Sea Shepherd supported Bethune as an anti-whaling activist but wished to “quietly” dissociate itself from him.*

***WHAT PETE BETHUNE SAYS***

*   *He was asked by Sea Shepherd to scuttle his boat after the collision.*
*   *He was given permission to take the bow and arrow on board, then criticised by Sea Shepherd when arrows were found by the Japanese.*
*   *His expulsion from Sea Shepherd hurt his case in court.*
*   *His testimony followed legal instruction.*
*   *He still “loved” Sea Shepherd but felt the organisation was too dishonest for him to stay.*

*United States businessman Ady Gil, who donated the boat which bore his name to Sea Shepherd, backed Mr Bethune’s resignation.*
