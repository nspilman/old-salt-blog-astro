![cementcarrierbow](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/01/cementcarrierbow.jpg)The [passengers on the NorthLink ferry *Hrossey*, crossing Pentland Firth, off Scotland, saw a grim sight](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-30667084) out the ferry windows — the bow of the cement carrier *Cemfjord* floating vertically in the water. No distress call was received from the ship, which had been carrying 2,000 tonnes of cement and had been sailing from Aalborg in Denmark to Runcorn in Cheshire. Searches were conducted using lifeboats and helicopters but there was no sign of the crew of eight aboard the ship. The coast guard has said that chances of finding survivors is “[very slim](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-30670842)“.
