![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/story.navy_.spice_.gi_.jpg) “Spice” is apparently the generic name for so-called “synthetic marijuana” or “fake pot.”  In most states,  it is still perfectly legal, though [that may be changing](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/us/11k2.html?_r=2).  “Spice” is, however, [not OK with the US Navy](http://www.theday.com/article/20110204/NWS09/302049916/1018).  At the end of last month, the Navy expelled seven midshipmen from the Naval Academy for using “spice.”   On Friday, the Navy also discharged 16 sailors assigned to the Norfolk, Virginia-based [*USS Bataan*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bataan_\(LHD-5\)) for using or dealing “spice.”
