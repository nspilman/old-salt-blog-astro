*The David MacGregor Library, named after a life-long supporter of the ss Great Britain, is free to the public and also includes an historic archive.*  
  
*Mr Macgregor was a [prolific writer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FDavid-R.-MacGregor%2FB001HPL0YW%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_tc_img_2_0%26qid%3D1290108331%26sr%3D1-2-ent&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957) and ship architect, who donated his collection to [The Brunel Institute.](http://www.ssgreatbritain.org/BrunelInstitute.aspx)*

*“I like to think that he’d be really proud and pleased to see all of his books,” said Rhiann Tritton, director of museum and educational services.*

*“\[They are\] not just only on the shelves but cleaned, security-tagged and in beautiful apple-pie order and ready for people to look at.*

*“So, I like to think that he’s here with us and he’s happy.”*

*David MacGregor, who was born in 1925 and died in 2005, was the son of an officer in a Scottish Regiment. Although there was no nautical or boating interest in the family, he was keen on sailing ships and devoted most of his spare time to maritime research.*

*It is these notes that form part of the [Brunel Institute](http://www.ssgreatbritain.org/BrunelInstitute.aspx)‘s new collection.*

*The Brunel Institute is in partnership with the University of Bristol and the education centre’s Brunel papers will also be added to the collection for public use.*
