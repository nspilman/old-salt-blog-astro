Oar fish are real “sea serpents.”  They can grow to be 50′ long and are the longest bony fish in the world.  As they live in deep water, they are rarely seen on the surface. Nevertheless, over the weekend, Jasmine Santana, a marine science instructor at the [Catalina Island Marine Institute](http://www.cimi.org/), found an 18’dead oar fish while snorkeling off the California coast.  With the help of 15 or 20 of the crew of sailing school vessel *[Tole Mour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tole_Mour)* and institute instructors she carried the rare fish to shore.

*“We’ve never seen a fish this big,” said Mark Waddington, senior captain of the [Tole Mour,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tole_Mour) CIMI’s sail training ship. “The last oarfish we saw was three feet long.”*
