![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Euroferry-1.jpg)This has been a bad week for shipboard fires. The [car carrier *Felicity Ace* caught fire](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2022/02/car-carrier-felicity-ace-on-fire-and-adrift-in-the-atlantic/) Wednesday in the Atlantic, off the Azores, and is still burning and adrift, awaiting salvage tugs. Fortunately, the 22 person crew was evacuated safely.

Yesterday, a blaze swept through the [*Euroferry Olympia*](https://www.grimaldi-lines.com/en/ship/euroferry-olympia/), a ferry sailing from Greece to Italy. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/twelve-still-missing-after-fire-engulfs-greece-italy-ferry-2022-02-19/) reports that of the 241 passengers and 51 crew on board when the fire broke out, 12 people are still missing. Rescue vessels moved most of the 280 people who were rescued to the nearby island of Corfu.

The 183-metre (600-foot) ferry caught fire en route from Igoumenitsa, a port in Western Greece, to the Italian port of Brindisi, a nine-hour journey.

Aerial footage released by the Greek coastguard on Friday showed rows of burnt trucks on the blackened deck after flames swept through the ship, owned by Grimaldi Lines. The ferry was carrying 153 vehicles, the company said.

The missing passengers are from Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey and Lithuania, the Greek coastguard said, and their relatives faced an agonizing wait for news.
