Well planned passive resistance proved to be an effective tactic for the crew of the *[MV Lugela](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?mmsi=354112000)* this weekend.  Earlier this month we [posted about the hijacking and subsequent recapture of the M/V Magellan Star](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/09/09/us-marines-recapture-mv-magellan-star-from-somali-pirates/) from Somali pirates by US Marine commandos, after the crew had disabled the engine and hid in a safe room.  On Saturday, 900 miles off the cost of Somalia, pirates attacked the *[MV Lugela](http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?mmsi=354112000)*, a 4,000 dwt cargo ship with a Ukranian crew.   In accordance with a prepared response plan, the crew locked themselves in the engine room with stocks of food and water, after disabling the helm and other bridge controls.   After failing to gain access to either the crew or the engine room, the pirates have reportedly given up and left the ship, allowing the crew to regain full control.

*Pirates who hijacked a Greek-operated cargo off Somalia finally let it go because the Ukrainian crew members prevented them from taking over command, the Ukrainian government said on Monday.*

*The foreign ministry in Kiev said the pirates had given up after failing to take control of the MG Lugela because the 12 crew had locked themselves in the engine room and blocked the helm and other controls.*

*“In line with a prepared plan, the crew shut themselves in the engine room with sufficient food and water,” the ministry said. “Keeping command of the controls, they did not allow the pirates to change course for the Somali coast.”*

*“After two days aboard an uncontrollable ship, the pirates finally gave up and abandoned it.”*

*George Tripakis, managing director of TDM Carrier, the Athens-based operator of the Lugela, said earlier that the captain had contacted the company late Sunday.*

*“He informed us that everybody is OK, alive, the pirates not on board, and the vessel is proceeding to Bombay (Mumbai, India).”*

*Pirates attacked the vessel on Saturday some 900 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia, after it left the Gulf of Aden, the Brussels-based the European Union NAVFOR command said.*
