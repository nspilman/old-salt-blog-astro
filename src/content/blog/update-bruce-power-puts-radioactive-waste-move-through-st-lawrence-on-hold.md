[![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nuclear-waste-sign.jpg)Last February we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/08/shipping-of-nuclear-waste-approved-on-the-great-lakes/) about the the [Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission](http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/) approval of a plan for [Bruce Power](http://www.brucepower.com/pagecontent.aspx?navuid=1) to ship 1,600 tonnes of radioactive waste,  in 16 decommissioned nuclear reactors, across the Great Lakes, though the St. Lawrence Seaway and across the Atlantic Ocean to Sweden for recycling.  Shortly thereafter, complaints were raised by the Mohawk community, whose reservation straddles the St. Lawrence River.  Bruce Power has announced that it has put the project on hold while it schedules talks with Mohawk and other native groups in Canada.  The project has also raised concerns about the safety of other hazardous cargoes that now routinely travel through the Seaway.
