Arinson watching the Heat

Carnival’s CEO & Chairman, Micki Arinson has been criticized for maintaining a low profile following the sinking of the *Costa Concordia* where over 30 passengers and crew are dead or missing.  Last Friday, he made what was believed to be his first public appearance following the sinking.   The [62-year-old billionaire sat court-side in Miami to watch the Miami Heat](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/28/us-ship-italy-arison-idUSTRE80R08T20120128) play basketball. Arinson owns the team along with roughly half of the global cruise line industry. Arinson’s team won the game. The Heat beat the New York Knicks 99-89.

[In related news, the American Express offer](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2093127/Costa-Concordia-Embarrassment-American-Express-promotes-trip-doomed-liner.html), which arrived in the mail to certain card holders in Florida, offered a seven night cruise through France, Italy, and Spain on the *Costa Concordia*, for only $749 and encouraged cardholders to ‘immerse yourself in a truly European experience.’  American Express spokeswoman Christine Elliot said: ‘*The mailing was already underway when the accident occurred. We apologize for any inconvenience to those who received it.*
