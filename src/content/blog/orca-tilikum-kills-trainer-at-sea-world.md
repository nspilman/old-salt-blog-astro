Tilikum

Orcas, commonly known as killer whales, have never been known to kill a human in the wild.  The same is not true of orcas in captivity. Today [Tilikum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilikum_\(whale\)#Tilikum), a 12,300 pound bull orca,  the largest whale in captivity, attacked and drowned a female trainer at [Sea World](http://www.seaworld.com/orlando/)’s Shamu Stadium in Orlando, FL.   This is [not the first trainer death associated with Tilikum.](http://www.businessinsider.com/seaworlds-killer-whale-tilikum-has-killed-before-2010-2) He was also involved with two other orcas in 1992 in the death of a trainer at Sealand of the Pacific near Victoria, British Columbia.   Tilikum was at the scene of a death of park visitor on July 6, 1999.  Tilikum is not the only captive killer whale to have attacked a trainer.  In December of last year, a trainer was also drowned after being held underwater by a [killer whale in a Spanish zoo](http://www.underwatertimes.com/news.php?article_id=10561240378).   Since the 1970s [more than ten cases of trainers attacked by orcas](http://www.angelfire.com/gu/orcas/attack.html) have been recorded.
