Off Kent, in the UK, the world’s biggest offshore wind farm has been officially opened.   With 100 turbines, the Thanet project  is expected to generate enough electricity to power 200,000 homes.  Currently the UK gets 3% of all its energy from renewable sources. It is aiming to reach 15% by 2020.

Of the [top 25 offshore wind farms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_offshore_wind_farms) in the world today, 24 are in the European Union.  One is in China.  The US has no operational offshore wind farms.  [Cape Wind](http://www.capewind.org/), the proposed wind farm closest to fruition in the US,  is still the [subject of controversy and partisan politcs](http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/09/10/10climatewire-cape-wind-proposal-faces-a-renewed-political-25840.html).   Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.html) for passing the article along.
