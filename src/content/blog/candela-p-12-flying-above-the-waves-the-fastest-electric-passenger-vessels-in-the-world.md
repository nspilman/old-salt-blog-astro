For several years now, we have followed the [all-electric hydrofoil runabouts](https://oldsaltblog.com/flying-on-a-candela-c7-electric-hydrofoil-boat/) designed and built by [Candela](https://candela.com/). Now the Swedish boat builder and engineering design firm has moved beyond runabouts to delivering the P -12, the world’s [first serial-production electric hydrofoiling passenger ferry](https://electrek.co/2025/11/06/candelas-flying-electric-boats-set-to-soar-around-the-maldives/) which appears to be on the brink of revolutionizing urban ferry services around the world.

Recently, a Candela P-12, a 30-passenger ferry, completed what the company says is the [longest electric sea journey ever made by an electric passenger vessel.](https://electrek.co/2026/02/02/candelas-hydrofoil-ferry-just-rewrote-the-limits-of-electric-boats/) The 160-nautical-mile voyage saw the ferry travel from Gothenburg on Sweden’s west coast to Oslo, Norway, over the course of three days.

The Candela P-12 cruises at 25 knots, has exceeded 30 knots in testing, and can travel up to 40 nautical miles at speed on a single charge. The entire 160-nautical-mile journey consumed just over €200 worth of electricity (roughly US $230). Compared to the diesel ferries it operates alongside, *Nova* emits 95% less CO₂ and uses 84% less energy per passenger-kilometer. That translates to just 23 grams of CO₂ per passenger-kilometer, compared to 439 grams for the older diesel vessels. In other words, it’s a drop in a bucket compared to the old standard.

[Electrek](https://electrek.co/2025/04/08/it-floats-it-flies-it-works-worlds-first-hydrofoil-electric-ferry-is-crushing-it/) notes that even when compared to traditional electric ferries, which are already an improvement by reducing emissions, electric hydrofoil ferries like these go so much further. They not only use *even less* energy than a traditional electric ferry, but they offer a faster trip and a smoother ride, making the idea of ferry travel that much more enticing.

For the past year,*Nova,* a prototype Candela P–12, has provided ferry service in Stockholm harbor and holds the title of the fastest electric passenger vessel currently in service. The all-electric vessel has proven itself capable of traveling faster and farther using far less energy and on a smaller battery than any passenger ferry service.

With 80% average occupancy (and many trips fully booked), *Nova* has become quite literally one of the hottest tickets on Stockholm’s Route 89. Some of that success may come from its 30-minute travel time between Tappström and Stockholm City Hall — roughly half the time it takes to get there by car or bus.

The Norway trip was designed to highlight just how different that efficiency makes real-world operations. In Oslo, the fastest conventional electric passenger ferry runs a fixed 10-nautical-mile route and depends on swapping multi-megawatt-hour battery containers at each stop – an infrastructure system that has cost hundreds of millions of Norwegian kroner and limited route flexibility.

By contrast, the Candela P-12 charges using standard DC fast chargers. Along the journey, it plugged into existing fast-charging stations where available to recharge in around one hour, and when they weren’t, it used a portable 360 kW DC charger powered by a mobile battery system – towed behind a Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup. That meant no megawatt-scale dock installations were required.

Candela isn’t stopping in Sweden, either. The company already has customers lined up in [Saudi Arabia](https://electrek.co/2024/08/18/saudi-arabias-bold-plan-to-ferry-people-around-in-flying-electric-boats/), [New Zealand](https://electrek.co/2024/03/13/worlds-cleanest-lake-is-getting-a-new-flying-electric-hydrofoil-ferry/), the [Maldives](https://electrek.co/2025/11/06/candelas-flying-electric-boats-set-to-soar-around-the-maldives/), and [the U.S.](https://electrek.co/2024/11/21/lake-tahoe-getting-hydrofoil-electric-ferry-as-candela-lands-major-deal/), suggesting that this may be just the beginning of the era of flying electric ferries.
