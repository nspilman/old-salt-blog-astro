![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/03/whaleshiporg.jpg)This looks fascinating. The [New Bedford Whaling Museum](https://www.whalingmuseum.org/) has announced that, in partnership with [Mystic Seaport Museum](https://www.mysticseaport.org/), they have developed the world’s most comprehensive whaling history database which is now available online for everyone to use at [WhalingHistory.org](https://whalinghistory.org/). 

In their announcement, they say that “researchers, genealogists, students, teachers, and history buffs alike will find the site to be the most robust and useful repository of whaling history documentation and scholarship. Users will be able to find and trace whaling voyages and ships to specific logbooks, as well as the list of crewmembers aboard most of the voyages. The foundational fabric of Whaling History features three databases that have been stitched together – the American Offshore Whaling Voyage (AOWV) database, the American Offshore Whaling Log database, and an extensive whaling crew list database.”
