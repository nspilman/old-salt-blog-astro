![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ussconstitionmuseum.jpg)We recently [posted about two virtual tours](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/03/during-the-lockdown-a-choice-of-virtual-tours-of-uss-constitution/) available on the historic frigate USS *Constitution.* In these days of the coronavirus lockdown, the ship is closed as is the shoreside museum. Just as you can tour the ship virtually, the [USS Constitution Museum](https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/) has developed a virtual portal to bring the museum to visitors while the public can no longer visit the museum.

“We are offering compelling educational materials for curious students and armchair sailors,” said Anne Grimes Rand, Museum President & CEO. “Whether it’s students who cannot attend classes, educators looking for ideas, or adults with a penchant for learning about *Constitution*, we remain committed to delivering interesting and informative content during this difficult and uncertain time.

Every day the Museum provides content related to *Constitution* through its social media channels, including [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/USSConstitutionMuseum?ref=sgm), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/USSConstMuseum/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/usscm/), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiXT6-9R6lhTNGXkv1AjMfw), and website [usscm.org](http://www.usscm.org/). Through new blog posts, in-depth research publications, artifact highlights, crew profiles, original videos, and interactive and educational webpages, the Museum continues to seamlessly engage with its virtual audience in new and exciting ways.

The weekly social media schedule includes, but is not limited to:

*   Monday: Research publication and LEGO® Ship Shape Competition
*   Tuesday: Blog post
*   Wednesday: Hands-on family activity
*   Thursday: Artifact highlight
*   Friday: Meet a historic sailor from “Old Ironsides”
*   Saturday: Notable event from *Constitution* history
*   Sunday: Video feature
*   Additionally, USS *Constitution* is hosting daily virtual tours using Facebook Live at 1 p.m. ET.

Families at home can enjoy hands-on activities through an engaging resource now available digitally, including the Museum’s *“Old Ironsides” Activity Book*, which utilizes rich illustrations of renowned artist Stephen Biesty and lively text of award-winning author Richard Platt. Families can also participate in the weekly LEGO® Ship Shape Competition on Facebook. Each Monday at 12 noon ET the Museum will post a new contest with a Thursday at 2 p.m. ET deadline. The winners are determined by online voting.

On April 1, the Museum will launch *A Sailor’s Life for Me*, a dynamic online game and educator resource that allows people of all ages to step into the shoes of an 1812 sailor and take on the tasks and challenges of life at sea, including scrubbing the deck, whacking rats in the hold, and sailing the ship at sea.
