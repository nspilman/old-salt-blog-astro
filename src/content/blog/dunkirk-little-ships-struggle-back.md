Mary Scott under tow

The English Channel is still the Channel and the 60 or so “little ships” of Dunkirk haven’t gotten any younger.  The flotilla of some 60 of the original “little ships” were delayed in their return to Ramsgate after reinacting the crossing to the Dunkirk evacuation of 70 years ago.   Several of the vessels required assistance after mechanical breakdowns.  Thanks to the [Tall Ship & Traditional Sail Professionals](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=2041742&trk=anet_ug_hm) Linked in group for pointing out the article.
