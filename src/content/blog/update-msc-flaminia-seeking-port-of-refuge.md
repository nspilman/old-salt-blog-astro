![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/08/MSC_Flaminia_salvage.jpg)In the middle of July, [we posted about a fire and explosion](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/07/15/containership-msc-flamina-in-flames-in-the-north-atlantic/) on the  6,750 TEU container ship *MSC Flaminia* in the mid-Atlantic, resulting in the death of one of the crew and one crew member missing and presumed dead.  The surviving crew abandoned the ship. The fire was subsequently brought under control by three salvage tugs and brought under tow back toward Europe.

For the last week or so, however, the ship and her escorting tugs have been in a holding position 150 miles off Land’s End while the ship’s owners plead with UK, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal  to allow the ship to enter their coastal waters.

“I think it’s ridiculous that a ship sailing under a German flag in this situation can’t get permission from countries in the European community,” said Helmut Ponath, head of NSB shipping company.
