![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/11/dolphinshumpbacks.jpg)A wonderful story from [Robyn White](https://www.newsweek.com/authors/robyn-white) writing for [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/dolphins-lost-whale-calf-video-1839854).

 A pod of dolphins led a whale and her calf back to their migration route after they became lost and distressed, a heartwarming video shows. The albino mother humpback whale was found by the [Dolphin Discovery Centre](https://dolphindiscovery.com.au/), near Bunbury’s Back Beach in Western Australia, after a few beachgoers noticed her in “distress.”

The whale—which had a dark front and a snowy-white back body—was at first mistaken for an orca by witnesses. But when the Dolphin Discovery Centre took a closer look, it realized it was an albino humpback whale, the Bunbury-based nonprofit said in a [Facebook post](https://fb.watch/o92z_cEUm2/).

This wasn’t the only thing it discovered, however. The whale had a calf swimming alongside her, and they had come very close to the coast in 45-foot-deep water near the city of Bunbury.

During this time of year, humpback whales migrate along the coast of Western Australia toward Antarctica, where they feed. Dolphins and whales will often share habitats but mainly stay with their own species.

Although both whales were fit and healthy, they were in quite a predicament this close to shore, away from their migration route. That is, until the pod of dolphins came to the rescue and began to lead them back to shore.

A [video of the moment was shared on social media](https://youtu.be/ipFKGtjWyz8?si=Pl0X_2js8mwC7TxS) and shows the heartwarming moment when the whales were led back to their route. In the clip, the whale and her calf can be seen swimming through the water as the pod of dolphins swims ahead of them, dipping in and out of the water.

The sea creatures move in unison with one another, and soon the whales are back on their way.
