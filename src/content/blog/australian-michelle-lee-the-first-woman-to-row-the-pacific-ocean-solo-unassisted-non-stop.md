![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/michellelee.jpg)Australian [Michelle Lee](https://solorower.com/) has become the [first woman to row solo, unassisted, and non-stop across the Pacific Ocean](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-05/michelle-lee-first-woman-rower-pacific-ocean-solo-237-days/102193290).  On her epic 237-day, 14,000-kilometre journey from Ensenada, Mexico to  Port Douglas in Far North Queensland, Australia, she dodged five hurricanes and four cyclones and survived a shark leaping into her boat. Lee set off from Mexico on August 8, 2022 in her 8-meter by 2-meter carbon fiber boat, the *Australian Maid.*

In 2019, the 50-year-old masseuse rowed 5,000 kilometers to cross the Atlantic Ocean in 68 days, despite having no professional rowing experience.
