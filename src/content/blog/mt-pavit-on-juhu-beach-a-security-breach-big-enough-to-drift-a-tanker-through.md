![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/gs4.jpg)Last June, the inaptly named [MV *Wisdom*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/23/the-folly-of-the-mv-wisdom/), under tow to a scrap yard, broke her tow line and drifted on to Juhu beach in Mumbai, India, after narrowly missing a major bridge. This Sunday, the tanker, [MT *Pavit*](http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/M.t.-Pavit-9016636.html), drifted ashore on the same beach, to the apparent surprise of all concerned. The [ship had been previously reported to have sunk](http://www.afternoondc.in/city-news/why-did-pavit-owner-say-she-had-sunk/article_31442) on June 29 off Oman following flooding in the engine room.

After the [attacks of November 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Mumbai_terrorist_attacks), in which ten terrorists in inflatable speedboats came ashore in two location in Mumbai, there have been efforts made to strengthen coastal security. Nevertheless the [MT *Pavit* drifted for nearly 100 hours in Indian territorial waters](http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Pavit-exposes-chinks-in-coastal-security/826388/) without being detected, arriving on Juhu catching the police and coastal authorities by surprise..  As was the case following the grounding of the MV *Wisdom*, [investigations are being called for](http://www.hindustantimes.com/High-level-probe-into-MT-Pavit-incident-Govt/Article1-728733.aspx)  to determine how the MT *Pavit* breached coastal security.
