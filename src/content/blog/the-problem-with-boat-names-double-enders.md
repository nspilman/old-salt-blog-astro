![inspiredvirgin](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/inspiredvirgin-160x200.jpg)As [we posted today](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/07/bon-voyage-donna-lange-inspired-insanity-on-second-solo-circumnativation/), Donna Lange has just set off on her second solo circumnavigation on her Southern Cross 28, *Inspired Insanity*. A photo of the Donna and the boat points out one problem with painting a boat name on a double-ender. Reading across from left to right the boat’s name is *Inspired Insanity* from the *Virgin Islands*.  On the other hand, reading from up to down and then left to right, the name becomes *Inspired Virgin* from the *Insanity Islands*.

I am not sure where the Insanity Islands are on a chart but I have the distinct recollection of visiting once or twice.
