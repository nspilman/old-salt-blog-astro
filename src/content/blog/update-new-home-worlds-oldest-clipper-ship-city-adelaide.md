![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/coa200.jpg)At the end of January, we posted [Clipper Ship *City of Adelaide* Still Not Quite Home](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=45338&action=edit), where we noted: “*The ship is sitting on a deck barge as a “temporary” accommodation at Port Adelaide’s Dock 1, with no permanent dock space yet in sight. The State Government’s commitment to provide a permanent location for the largely privately funded project remains unfulfilled.*”

Now there is good news. The [State Government of South Australia has announced plans for a permanent home of the historic clipper ship](http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/messenger/west-beaches/dock-2-in-port-adelaide-is-governments-preferred-home-for-worlds-oldest-clipper-ship-city-of-adelaide/news-story/5afe188c77b88cc6226f32dc27fe77ed), the oldest surviving clipper in the world, as part of a proposed Port Adelaide marine precinct. The ship will be moved to the port’s Dock 2, and include a pedestrian bridge and road access. 

Built in Sunderland, England, in 1864, the [*City of Adelaide*](http://www.cityofadelaide.org.au/) is a composite clipper ship. Like the somewhat newer [*Cutty Sark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark), a composite ship has wooden planks over an iron keel, frames and girders. *City of Adelaide* made 23 annual return voyages from London and Plymouth to Adelaide, South Australia. An estimated 250,000 Australians can trace their ancestry to passengers who arrived on the ship.
