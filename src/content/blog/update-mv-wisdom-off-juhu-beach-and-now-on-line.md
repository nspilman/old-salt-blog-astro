![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wisdom.jpg)Three weeks ago [we posted about the MV *Wisdom*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/06/23/the-folly-of-the-mv-wisdom/), which had been on her way to a Gujarat scrapyard when the tow line parted. The drifting ship nearly hit a major bridge near Mumbai before finally grounding on Juhu Beach, where is became a tourist attraction, much to the distress of local lifeguards and the the police. The ship did prove to be a short-lived windfall for local beach vendors.  Late last Saturday at high tide salvage crews using three tugs freed the ship from the beach. The ship was towed to the Mumbai outer anchorage in preparation for towing to Alang-Bhavnagar Gujarat for scrapping.   Three beach-goers drowned and thirty seven had to be rescued when they attempted to get too close to the grounded ship.

The wayward ship may be gone from Juhu Beach, but has been added to an on-line game, [Mumbai Underground](http://mu.ibibo.com/) ,  where the ship has been added to the game’s story line.

*“There were many questions around the appearance of MV Wisdom in Indian waters and this triggered us to add this feature on our game. We have also given a mystery twist to the whole application, playing with the imaginations of the people to attract them towards it,” says Rahul Razdan, president, products and operations, ibibo web. MV Wisdom’s appearance in Mumbai Underworld follows additions such as ‘Lambani’ House and the Adarsh Society scam.*

*In the game version of ‘Wisdom Ship in Mumbai World’, the ship is seen carrying illegal arms and ammunition and gamers need to find the explosives floating near the shores. On discovering them, they get special ammunition that increases their power in the game. Razdan says, “We should understand that it’s just a game set to current background and has nothing to do with actual facts.”*
