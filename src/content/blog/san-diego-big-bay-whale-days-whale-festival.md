![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/breach400.jpg)As one who is shivering in the snow, I am highly envious of the good folks in San Diego who will be celebrating their 3rd annual [Big Bay Whale Days & Whale Festival](http://www.whaledays.com/) this Saturday, January 22nd, in observance of the annual gray whale migration along the California coast.  There will be concerts, free whale watching cruises and discounts to maritime museums and attractions.  Sounds like a great time.
