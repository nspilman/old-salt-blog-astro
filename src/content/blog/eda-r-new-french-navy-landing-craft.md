A few days ago we posted about [the boats Washington used to cross the Delaware](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/26/washington-crossing-the-delaware-and-the-durham-boats/).  Designs have changed since then,  Here is a wonderful animation by [Raphaël Pierrot](http://lcat.model.free.fr/index.html) of the new French Navy  landing craft, the [engin de débarquement amphibie rapide (EDA-R)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engin_de_d%C3%A9barquement_amphibie_rapide), which is a catamaran which provides the performance of an aircushion landing craft at the cost of a conventional landing craft.
