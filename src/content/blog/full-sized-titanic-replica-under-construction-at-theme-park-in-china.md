![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/08/chinese-titanic.jpg)Five years ago we posted about the beginning of the construction of “[A Close to Unsinkable Titanic in China’s Sichuan Province.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/12/close-unsinkable-titanic-chinas-sichuan-province/)” Construction began on November 30th, 2016 in Suining, Sichuan province, China, 745 miles from the sea. The full-sized replica will be a fixed attraction, rather than a ship, as a part of Star Energy Investment Group’s plans for a tourist resort called [Romandisea](https://www.facebook.com/RomandiseaTitanic/), along the Qijiang River in Sichuan’s Daying County.

Our [recent post about the collapsing ice wall](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/08/wall-of-ice-collapses-at-tennessee-titanic-museum-injuring-three/) on the half-scale partial mock-up of the *Titanic* in an attraction in Pigeon Forge, TN, brought to mind the Chinese full-sized replica. While the replica *Titanic* was originally expected to take just over a year to complete, [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/titanic-replica-china/index.html) reports that the replica is still under construction, with no announced completion date.

The replica will feature the same amenities as its namesake, including banquet halls, theaters, observation decks, and a swimming pool. Guests will be able to pay to spend the night aboard the ship, which will be permanently docked in a reservoir in the Qijiang River, about 130 kilometers from the provincial capital Chengdu — several hundred miles from the sea.

The [Romandisea](https://www.facebook.com/RomandiseaTitanic/) Titanic is not to be confused with [Clive Barker’s much-ballyhooed Titanic II](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6310185/Exact-replica-Titanic-set-sail-2022-follow-original-ships-route.html) project that notionally will build a near (sort-of) replica of the ill-fated ship, which may or may not ever be built.  

According to the [AFP](https://news.yahoo.com/huge-titanic-replica-open-chinese-034229649.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK4V86T0IajiBQhIZdd7s9wceA2AsyxIiPkJMW2S3gte0b_BoUu26qzzE_51nRgaADvbSOZImB9AMytKots_38tC14YdPntFUJfhRD4H3qAdvXtSUeN95rGLrHYxiC6id0hXFbXRiFoneTt811LVh0ORguu6aUUC6UEc4bqpBb6M), it’s taken 23,000 tons of steel and cost one billion yuan ($153.5 million) to build the Romandisea replica. By comparison, the mock-up structure in Pigeon Forge cost $25 million to build.

Below is a short video showing the progkress in the construction of the replica *Titanic*.
