Battleship Texas

Last June we [posted about the near sinking](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/16/fire-in-tampa-lightning-in-the-gulf-and-the-battleship-texas-still-afloat/) of the battleship *[Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Texas_\(BB-35\))*.  Now a final effort to save the 96 year old ship is underway.   A cofferdam will be built around the ship to create a dry berth for the battleship.   In related news, South Carolina state officials have expressed displeasure over the imminent default by the Patriots Point Development Authority on a $9.2 million loan.  The loan was intended to repair the World War II destroyer *[Laffey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Laffey_\(DD-724\))*.   Not only can’t the Development Authority pay back the loan but they are seeking $85  million to maintain the destroyer *Laffey*, the carrier *[Yorktown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Yorktown_\(CV-10\))* and submarine *[Clamagore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Clamagore_\(SS-343\))* at Patriots Point.
