![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/06/clearvaterrevival2020.jpg)The *Clearwater* [Great Hudson River Revival](https://www.clearwaterfestival.org/) is a music and environmental summer festival held yearly since 1966, on the banks of the Hudson River. It is said to be America’s oldest and the largest annual festival of its kind. 

In the year of a pandemic,  the things have changed. This year’s Revival will be a series of online performances and events streamed live on Saturday, June 20th, from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on the [*Clearwater*’s website](https://www.clearwaterfestival.org/), [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/HRSloopClearwater) and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/252368766081467/).

Performers will include Judy Collins; Peter Yarrow; Tom Chapin and the Chapin Sisters; Guy Davis; Kyle Tigges; The Mammals; Reggie Harris; David Amram; John McCutcheon; Jay Ungar and Molly Mason; Noel Paul Stookey; Tom Paxton and more. All proceeds benefit [Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc](https://www.clearwater.org/)., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit environmental organization. 

Clearwater was founded by Pete Seeger, legendary musician, singer, songwriter, folklorist, activist, environmentalist, and peace advocate. In 1966, in despair over the pollution of his beloved Hudson River, Seeger announced plans to “build a boat to save the river.”  At the time, the Hudson was rank with raw sewage, toxic chemicals and oil pollution; fish had disappeared over many miles of its length. Seeger, along with many other concerned individuals, believed a majestic replica of the sloops that sailed the Hudson in the 18th and 19th centuries would bring people to the river where they could experience its beauty and be moved to preserve it. Inspired by that vision, the organization began with the launch of the [sloop *Clearwater*](https://www.clearwater.org/the-sloop/) in 1969 —a majestic 106-foot long replica vessel.

Today, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. and the iconic sloop *Clearwater* are carrying forward Pete Seeger’s legacy by partnering with Hudson Valley schools and community leaders to raise the bar of environmental education and encouraging youth to become involved as active stewards of their environment and the Hudson River.
