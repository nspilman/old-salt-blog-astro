A few photos from a recent visit to the *[Star of India](http://www.sdmaritime.org/star-of-india/)* at the [Maritime Museum of San Diego](http://www.sdmaritime.org/). The *Star of India* was built in  in 1863 as *Euterpe*, a full-rigged iron windjammer ship, in Ramsey, Isle of Man.  The Maritime Museum of San Diego has done a fantastic job at resorting,  maintaining and sailing the grand old ship.
