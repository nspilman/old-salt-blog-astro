The Sea Shanty Sessions are co-sponsored by the [Folk Music Society of New York,](http://www.minstrelrecords.com/fmsny/about.html) Inc. and are dedicated to the memory of William Main Doerflinger (1909-2000)  a noted music scholar who visited Sailors’ Snug Harbor often and collected love shanties and other traditional sailor’s songs from the mariners who resided there.   The Noble Maritime Collection celebrates the history of Sailors’ Snug Harbor and the tradition of sea shanties, a folk art that gave sailors a medium for expression and storytelling.

The Noble Maritime Collection is a maritime museum and study center celebrating the people and traditions of the working waterfront of New York Harbor. It is the repository of the original manuscripts Doerflinger wrote, as well as the art and artifacts that graced Sailors’ Snug Harbor during the 140 years it was on Staten Island.

The museum’s public gallery hours are Thursday through Sunday from one until five PM. The museum is also open for tours and school group visits, scheduled by appointment. Admission is by donation.
