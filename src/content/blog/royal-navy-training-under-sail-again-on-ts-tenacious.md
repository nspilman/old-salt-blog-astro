![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tstenacious.jpg)The [Royal Navy has announced](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2021/march/17/20210317-tenacious) that for the first time in decades, its sailors are learning the art of seafaring on a traditional tall ship.

Over four months junior sailors are crewing [*TS Tenacious*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV_Tenacious) – giving them a unique insight into the days of sail and the chance to pick up key leadership skills.

The square-rigger is running in and out of Portsmouth with Royal Navy sailors performing tasks and duties Nelson would recognize: from heaving and hauling lines to set the sails, to watchkeeping and steering.

The use of the [Jubilee Sailing Trust](https://jst.org.uk/)’s *Tenacious* is helping to plug the gap left by the closure of the Navy’s command and leadership school in the Brecon Beacons due to the pandemic.

“In a difficult period for Royal Navy training due to the pandemic, the use of the Jubilee Sailing Trust has allowed us to continue to provide top quality core leadership and team training in a maritime context,” said Commander Adrian Coulthard from the Navy’s training organization.

Launched in 2000, *Tenacious* is the largest wooden tall ship built in the United Kingdom in the last 100 years.
