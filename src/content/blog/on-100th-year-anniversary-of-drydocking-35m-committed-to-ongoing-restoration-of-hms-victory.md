One hundred years ago today, on January 12, 1922, Nelson’s flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar, [HMS *Victory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Victory) was moved to Drydock No. 2 in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard for restoration and preservation. In honor of the anniversary, it was announced that an additional £35m is being committed for continued repairs to the historic ship. 

A [dockyard spokeswoman said](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/nelson-portsmouth-portsmouth-historic-dockyard-chatham-german-b975979.html?fbclid=IwAR1Pogqkk3HdesQSq40pBoTufgWUHcIrfR8NRZW52VIAQjT046OfRdUuNwg): “Rotting planking will be removed from the hull and replaced with new oak, repairs made to the ship’s structural framework, and she will be fully re-rigged, in a process lasting 10 to 15 years and costing £35 million.

“The project will provide visitors with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to see beneath *Victory*’s skin and experience a first-rate line-of-battle ship being taken through a great repair.”

The new project is part of a 20-year conservation program. A [new docking structure](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/05/hms-victory-safely-berthed/) utilizing 134 high-tech “props” to distribute the load across the hull was completed this summer.
