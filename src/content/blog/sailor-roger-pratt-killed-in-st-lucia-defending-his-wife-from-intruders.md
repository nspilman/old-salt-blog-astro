Terrible news from St. Lucia.  Roger Pratt, 62, was killed while defending his wife from intruders on their Premier 41 sailboat, [*Magnetic Attraction*](http://blog.mailasail.com/magneticattraction/216), near the town of Vieux Fort on the island nation of St. Lucia in the eastern Caribbean.  The [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2542359/Beaten-stabbed-dumped-sea-Courage-Briton-killed-saving-wife-robbers-storm-yacht-Caribbean.html) is reporting that Pratt was beaten and stabbed several times by the men who boarded the sail boat late Friday night.  Margaret Pratt was also injured in the attack. The [BBC reports](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25797968):

*He said that officers heard that three armed men had boarded the boat, named the Magnetic Attraction, and attacked the couple before fleeing.*

*“Margaret went in search of her husband and found him floating in the nearby waters. Roger was retrieved and transported to St Jude Hospital via ambulance along with his wife. He was pronounced dead on arrival while Margaret was treated and discharged.”*

 *The couple had been on their voyage since June, when they left Lowestoft, Suffolk, and headed for the Algarve before navigating their way to the Caribbean. They had been celebrating Mrs Pratt’s birthday when the attack took place.*
