![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/fluerdilei.jpg)In 1565, [Captain Jean Ribault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Ribault) sailed from France with ships and 800 settlers to resupply and reinforce the French colony of [Fort Caroline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Caroline) in what is now the state of Florida. The French colony was being threatened by the Spanish at nearby St. Augustine. Ribault’s fleet was caught in a hurricane and his flagship, *la Trinité*, sank just off Cape Canaveral, FL. 

Now a US judge has ruled that a wreck off Cape Canaveral is Ribault’s *la Trinité* and therefore the protected property of France. The State of Florida supported France’s claim to the wreck against Global Marine Exploration Inc., which argued that the shipwreck’s identity couldn’t be definitively established.  Artifacts from the ship, specifically, a granite monument bearing the French coat of arms, convinced U.S. Magistrate Judge Karla Spaulding that the shipwreck is *la Trinité* .

The [Florida Times Union](http://www.jacksonville.com/news/20180706/court-gives-france-rights-to-ancient-shipwreck-linked-to-fort-caroline-colony) reports that the salvage company discovered evidence of the shipwreck in 2016, finding three French bronze cannons, 12 anchors, ballast, a grinding wheel and the granite monument.

Records show Ribault’s flagship was carrying monuments, bearing the fleur-de-lis, that were intended to mark France’s claim to what it called New France, the southeast coast of what eventually became America.
