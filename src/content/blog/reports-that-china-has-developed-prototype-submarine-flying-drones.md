According to a report by the [South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3187955/chinese-scientists-develop-flying-unmanned-submarine), the flying submarine can support various military missions, including the detection of underwater mines.

Chinese professor Ji Wanfeng says the new drone will make it possible to disrupt the defense systems of enemy aircraft carriers. The drone can dive underwater to avoid radar. When detected by sonar, the drone can take off into the air. According to the professor, the simultaneous use of several such drones could overwhelm the computer systems of aircraft carriers.
