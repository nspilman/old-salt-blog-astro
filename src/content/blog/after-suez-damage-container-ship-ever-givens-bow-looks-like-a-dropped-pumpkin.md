Photographs have come out of the bow damage to the container ship [*Ever Given*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:5630138/mmsi:353136000/imo:9811000/vessel:EVER_GIVEN) after she ran hard aground in the Suez Canal, [blocking the critical waterway](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/03/ultra-large-container-ship-ever-given-blocks-suez-canal/) for six days last March. The images were taken in Qingdao, China, where the ship is awaiting repairs.

[One observer noted](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/42979/this-is-the-damage-done-to-that-huge-container-ship-that-clogged-the-suez-canal) that the bottom of her bulbous bow looks like a dropped pumpkin.

The damage is so extensive that there’s a “whole new lower bow section in the yard prepared,” according to Dr. Salvatore R. Mercogliano, an associate professor of history at Campbell University and adjunct professor at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.

“They will cut out that entire area and replace it with the new one they have fabricated,” he said in a tweet.
