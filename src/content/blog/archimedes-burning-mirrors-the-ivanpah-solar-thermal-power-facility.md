Archimedes Burning Mirrors Generating Electricity

During the Siege of Syracuse, 214–212 BC, Archimedes was said to have used “burning mirrors” to set fire to a Roman fleet attacking the city. The mirrors focused the rays of the sun and generated enough heat to set ships on fire. Long dismissed as folk-lore, researchers have been able to recreate the “burning mirrors” and have indeed set replica ships ablaze. (See our recent post, [Archimedes “Burning Mirrors” and London’s “Walkie Scorchie.”](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/01/archimedes-burning-mirrors-and-londons-walkie-scorchie/))  Now,  in the Mojave desert at the [Ivanpah Solar Thermal Power Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanpah_Solar_Power_Facility), a modern day version of Archimedes “burning mirrors,” is being used to generate electricity in the world’s largest solar thermal power system.

 At [Ivanpah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanpah_Solar_Power_Facility),  more than 300,000 mirrors focus the light of the sun on central generating towers. The solar energy creates steam in the towers to generate electricity. Not quite turning swords into plowshares, Archimedes “burning mirrors” have become electricity generating “[heliostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliostat).”   Ivanpah, with three energy towers and arrays, is expected to generate 377 MW of power or enough electricity to power 140,000 homes in California..  Ironically, the facility may the first and last of its kind to be built.  Since the project began, the cost of solar panels has dropped so dramatically, that solar thermal may no longer be competitive with solar photovoltaic electricity generation.
