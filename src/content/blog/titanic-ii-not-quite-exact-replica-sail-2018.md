![titanicII-1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/02/titanicII-1.jpg)Only last June, the media were reporting the project to build a near-replica of RMS *Titanic* was dead. The [Daily Echo](http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/shipping/13337940.Billionaire_s_Titanic_2_plans_sunk/) was typical, writing: *The highly ambitious plan to build a replica of the ill-fated Southampton liner, Titanic, has apparently sunk without even getting off the drawing board.* Now, the *[Titanic II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_II)* project appears to have been revived. Reports are that the near-replica of its ill-fated namesake will be delivered in 2018 and that its maiden voyage will be from Jiangsu in Eastern China to Dubai. The original *Titanic* never completed her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912, due to an unfortunate brush with an iceberg leaving 1,500 dead. Let’s hope the *Titanic II* does better.

While it is unclear if any steel has yet to be cut, through the wonder of 3D modeling, renderings of the interior spaces intended to look like the original have been released.

The project is backed by Australian billionaire Clive Palmer. The Titanic II is being variously described as an [exact replica](http://fox6now.com/2016/02/11/titanic-ii-exact-replica-of-ill-fated-ship-will-set-sail-in-2018/), a [near-exact relica](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/02/titanic-ii-to-set-sail-in-2018.html), and a [modern-day replica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_II).  Near-replica may be the better phrase.

The [Titanic II will be different from the original](http://www.titanic2ship.com/titanic-ships-comparison/) as follows:

*   More beam — to meet current stability requirements the Titantic II will be 4.2 meters wider than the original.
*   No steam — the new ship will have modern diesel-electric propulsion with three pod drives in lieu of propeller shafts and rudders.
*   No sheer — Unlike the original, the new ship will have no hull sheer.
*   Welded hull, no rivets, improved quality of steel.
*   More lifeboats (no surprise there.) New “Safety deck” to move the lifeboats lower and to provide access
*   Air conditioning
*   Modern navigation and electronics but no internet or wireless aboard.
