![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cremer.jpg)[Clarisse Cremer](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/news/19732/meet-clarisse-cremer) is the 12th [Vendee Globe](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/) racer to cross the finish line in Les Sables d’Olonne, having completed the solo, non-stop around the world race in 87 days, 02 hours, 24 minutes, and 25 seconds.

She is the first female skipper to complete the 2020-2021 race. Her time broke [Ellen MacArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_MacArthur)‘s solo non-stop record for a female skipper of 94 days 4 hours, which MacArthur set when she took second in the [2000-2001 Vendée Globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000%E2%80%932001_Vend%C3%A9e_Globe). 

[Sail-World](https://www.sail-world.com/news/234972/Clarisse-Cremer-12th-in-the-Vendee-Globe) reports that MacArthur sent a message of congratulations to Cremer, “Hi Clarisse, just a little message to say a big bravo for your race around the world. It’s great to see you at the finish line. It’s truly an exceptional lap. Well done for everything you have done!”

The 31 year old Cremer played down her ranking as first female to finish, “For me, yes we know that being a woman in ocean racing becomes a differentiator on land. But this is a mixed race and a mixed sport and it about the breadth of ocean racing together. There is no female classification. At sea, I am a sailor, and I don’t tell myself that the sailor in front is a man or a woman, I don’t think about that at all.” 

In the past eight sailings of the Vendee Globe race, there have never been more than two female sailors competing in each race. This time, six female skippers started the race. Sam Davies was forced to retire after hitting an underwater floating object. Isabelle Joschke retired after a mechanical failure in her boat’s canting keel. Three are still sailing. Pip Hare, Miranda Merron, and Alexia Barrier are in 19th, 23rd and 24th place respectively in the [current rankings](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/ranking).
