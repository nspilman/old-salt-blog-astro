![fishingboatrockaway](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/02/fishingboatrockaway.jpg)Those of us around New York harbor have been watching a dramatic rescue unfold this morning. Around 2 AM, the 76-foot scallop fishing vessel [*Carolina Queen III*, with 7 aboard, ran aground off Rockaway beach](http://abc7ny.com/news/crew-rescued-after-fishing-boat-runs-aground-off-rockaway-beach/1218047/) near the East Rockaway Inlet, in high winds and seas.  A 25 foot US Coast Guard rescue boat with a crew of five attempted to reach the fishing vessel but capsized in the 10 to 12-foot waves. All of the Coast Guard were wearing protective clothing and made it to the beach uninjured.  All seven of the crew aboard the *Carolina Queen III* were subsequently rescued by basket by a Coast Guard helicopter.
