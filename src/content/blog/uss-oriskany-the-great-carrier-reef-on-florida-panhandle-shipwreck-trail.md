![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/greatcarrierreef.jpg)[USS *Oriskany*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Oriskany_\(CV-34\)) is an Essex-class aircraft carrier completed after World War II. She served in both the Korean and the Vietnam wars. In 2006, the almost 900′ long  ship became the [world’s largest artificial reef](http://www.floridapanhandledivetrail.com/oriskany.html) after being sunk 22 miles south of Pensacola in more than 200 feet of water, as part of the [Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail](http://www.floridapanhandledivetrail.com/). Nicknamed the “Great Carrier Reef.” The top of the ship is within 80 feet of the surface and there are considerable portions of the ship in less than 100 feet of water, making them accessible to both sport and advanced divers. Here a video of diving on the Might O, the Great Carrier Reef.
