*[HMS Bounty](http://www.tallshipbounty.org/)* recently called at St. Augustine, FL.  During a dockside party on the ship, Dr. Roger Clark Smith, a local historian, decided that there would be no better setting to propose marriage to the fair Christine Whalen, who graciously accepted. Our congratulations to the happy couple.  We only hope that a “no mutiny” clause is added to the vows.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://alaricbond.com/) for passing the news along.
