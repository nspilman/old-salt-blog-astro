![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jsocrates1.jpg)For the last several days, [Jeanne Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Socrates) has been within sight of the mountains of the Vancouver coast, tantalizingly close to completing her 4th circumnavigation, and, at 77, becoming the oldest person to sail around the world solo, unassisted and non-stop.

Just 20 nautical miles from the entrance of the Strait of Juan De Fuca, and less than 80 miles from her destination in Victoria, British, Columbia, she has been set back by contrary currents and a lack of wind. Weather forecasts suggest a northwesterly wind later today may yet allow her to make landfall in Victoria this evening.

She set sail from Victoria on October 3, 2018, on her 38′ long [S/V](https://www.svnereida.com/boat-details) *[Nereida](https://www.svnereida.com/boat-details),* a Najad 380, and should return back to the dock in Victoria today, after roughly 340 days at sea. At the age of 77, she now holds the record for the oldest person to sail around the world solo, non-stop and unassisted.

Jeanne Socrates is a grandmother of three, originally from Ealing, West London. She didn’t start sailing until she was 50.  Prior to her most recent voyage around the world, she held the record as the oldest female to have circumnavigated the world single-handed, and the only woman to have circumnavigated solo nonstop from N. America. She was awarded the Cruising Club of America’s Blue Water Medal in 2013.
