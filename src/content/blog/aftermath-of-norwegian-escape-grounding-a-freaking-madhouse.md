![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Nescape.jpg)A cruise on the [*Norwegian Escape*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Escape) that sailed from Port Canaveral, Florida last Monday didn’t go well, and for a change, had little to do with Covid 19. On the second day of the cruise, the ship ran aground in high winds at Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, its first port-of-call. 

The good news is that the ship was refloated on Tuesday and there were no reported injuries among the more than 2,000 passengers or the 1,700 member crew. The bad news is that the passengers were stuck aboard the ship for the two days it took to arrange a damage survey and to determine that the hull damage was severe enough to cancel both the current cruise and the next cruise scheduled to begin March 19th.

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2022/03/18/norwegian-cruise-aground-dominican-republic/) reported that on Thursday evening passengers were notified that everyone still on the 1,069-foot-long ship would disembark the next day, starting at 4:30 a.m. Long lines for coronavirus tests followed. By Friday morning, social media posts showed hundreds of people standing in line at the Puerto Plata airport after being shuttled from the vessel waiting for charter flights throughout the day. 

In emails and on social media, passengers said there were no representatives from the cruise company at the airport to help travelers who were being flown to Orlando.  
   
“They literally dumped us off the ship with no further assistance after that,” one woman wrote on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lynn_family99/status/1504831554417217540?s=21). “It is a freaking madhouse at the airport.” 

Late Friday, the situation got worse for some passengers who remained in the Dominican Republic, according to social media posts and messages to The Washington Post.

> my cruise just dumped 2090 people at an airport in the Dominican Republic with absolutely no direction. Verbal fights are happening and no one knows what to do.

Norwegian Cruise Lines announced that all passengers will receive full refunds and credit for the same amount to apply towards a future cruise with *Norwegian Escape*.
