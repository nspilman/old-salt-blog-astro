![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Remora.jpg)My first thought was if that is a remora there must be quite a shark out there someplace. Obviously a different type of remora.  The [Remora 6000](http://www.phnx-international.com/Remora%206000%20ROV.htm) is a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) that can operate at depths up to 6,000 meters.    It  recently  retrieved  the  black box (which is actually orange) from the wreckage of Air France Flight 447 which crashed  into the Atlantic June 1, 2009 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people aboard.

*Wreckage from the aircraft was first spotted in early April, and the plane was found at a depth of about 3,900 meters (12,800 feet).*

*Photos of the orange recorder produced by Honeywell International suggest the device is intact, but it’s unclear whether data can be retrieved from it after such a long period on the seabed.*

*The 2,000-pound Remora was launched from the cable-laying ship Ile de Sein, operated by Alcatel-Lucent and Louis Dreyfus Armateurs of France.*

*The 5-foot-long, 25-horsepower ROV can operate to a depth of 6,000 meters (19,700 feet) and has two Hydro-Lek six-function manipulators to grapple objects; two cameras; and powerful lights to illuminate the depths. Its sensors include a laser gyro and scanning sonar.*
