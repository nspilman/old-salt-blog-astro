![sunited](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2009/04/sunited.jpg)The [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125417162355547323.html) today has an article about the [SS United States Conservancy](http://ssunitedstatesconservancy.org/SSUS/blog/), a group of individuals who fervently wish to save the *[SS United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_United_States)*.

I have the somewhat heretical view that the “Big U,” as she is called, is beyond saving.  In some respects, she was doomed from the start.   She went into service in 1952, the same year that Boeing began work on a plane that would be known as the 707, the plane that would make passenger liners obsolete. See our previous post – [Twilight of the Ocean Liners – the SS United States](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/04/20/twilight-of-the-ocean-liners-the-ss-united-states/).

The account in the Journal article doesn’t suggest much hope of saving the ship.  It tells of her supporters taking trips out into the Delaware River where the ship is moored “to touch the hull,” yet also says that the group does not know what it would cost to dock the ship, quoting Dan McSweeney, Executive Director of the Conservancy, as saying, “It behooves us to do some research on that.”
