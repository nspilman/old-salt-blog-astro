Conditions aboard the *Carnival Triump*h are reported to be growing increasingly grim. Since [the ship was disabled by an engine room fire on Sunday](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/02/engine-room-fire-strands-carnival-triumph-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-will-be-towed-to-mexico/) off the coast of Mexico with over 4,000 passengers and crew aboard, there has no hot food, no hot water, sweltering indoor temperatures, and few working toilets. Passengers have complained of toilets overflowing inside cabins and the smell of rotting food due to the lack of refrigeration. Access to fresh water is limited and lines for food are very long. Many passengers are reported to be sleeping on deck to avoid the heat and the smells.  The ship was approximately 150 miles from the Mexican port of Progreso when the fire occurred, but apparently drifted 90 miles northward on the [Yucatan Current](http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/caribbean/yucatan.html). Originally the company announced that the ship was to be towed to Mexico, but the decision was then made to made to tow the ship to Mobile, Alabama. This will simply the arranging travel for the disembarking passengers but has added an additional day’s time in getting the ship to port.   Thanks to Bobbi Sheffield for contributing to this post.
