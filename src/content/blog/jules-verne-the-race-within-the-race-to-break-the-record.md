Spindrift 2

Past attempts to claim the [Jules Verne Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_Trophy), awarded to the fastest sailboat to circumnavigate the globe, have been solitary affairs — a single sailboat attempting to break the previous record time. That changed on November 22, when two veteran maxi-trimarans, *[Spindrift 2](http://www.spindrift-racing.com/jules-verne/en/home)* and *[IDEC Sport](http://www.idecsport-sailing.com/?lang=en)* set off from Ushant to race against each other and the record.  Both boats are past trophy winners.

This two boat race against a record is something of a rematch. The [current record](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/jules-verne-trophy-banque-populaire-v-closing-on-finish-line-and-a-new-record-at-almost-thirty-knots/) of 45 days, 13 hours, 42 minutes, 53 seconds was set in January 2012 by *[Banque Populaire V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banque_Populaire_V)* under the command of Loïck Peyron. The previous record of 48 days 7 hours 44 minutes 52 seconds was set in 2010 by *[Groupama 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banque_Populaire_VII)* captained by Franck Cammas.  *Spindrift 2* is the renamed and slightly modified, record setting, *Banque Populaire V*  while *IDEC Sport* is the renamed and modified *Groupama 3.  Spindrift 2* and *IDEC Sport* are currently captained by Yann Guichard and Francis Joyon, respectively. Both boats were designed by [VPLP Design](http://www.vplp.fr/en/informations-en/news-en.html).

After 31 days and over 20,000 miles sailed the race is still relatively close, both between the two boats and the previous record. [*Spindrift 2* is currently in the lead currently holding a lead of 169 NM](http://www.spindrift-racing.com/jules-verne/en/live) ahead of where *Banque Populaire* V was at the same point in the race. [*IDEC Sport* is behind](http://trimaran-idec.geovoile.com/julesverne/2015/) but not by much, currently only 107 miles behind the record position. The two boats rounded Cape Horn on Monday and Tuesday and are now sailing in the South Atlantic in the last leg toward home.
