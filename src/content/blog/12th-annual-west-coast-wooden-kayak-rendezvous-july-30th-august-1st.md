*The annual West Coast Wooden Kayak Rendezvous (R2KX) is the first weekend in August at Fort Worden State Park in Port Townsend. The event is free and open to the public (donations to cover park fees gladly accepted).*  
  
*Bring your home-made kayak or canoe or just come and enjoy the people, boats, and activities. Expect to see strip-built and stitch-and-glue constructed boats as well as traditional skin-on-frame and folding kayaks. The adjacent beach is a great place to paddle or let the kids play.*

*Activities begin Friday and end Sunday with plenty of time between events to talk and try other people’s boats. Demonstrations will cover some of the basic processes of kayak construction. There will be a group dinner at the Beach Kitchen Shelter on Saturday evening.*
