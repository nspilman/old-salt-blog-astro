![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/09/sealoctoslap.jpg)If you are kayaking and happen to get slapped in the face by a flying octopus hurled by a seal, don’t take it personally. Its probably not about you.

Kyle Mulinder was kayaking near Kaikoura, New Zealand on Saturday when he was slapped in the face by a flying octopus, hurled by a seal. The seal wasn’t trying to send Mr. Mulinder a message. The seal was simply trying to catch some lunch. The octopus was just trying not to get eaten. 

The amazing thing is that it was all caught on video by Taiyo Masuda. Mr. Masuda said in an interview they were among a group of about 10 kayakers watching a group of seals relaxing on nearby rocks.  

The [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/world/asia/seal-octopus-slap-gopro.html) reports, after the slap attack, the octopus clung to the bottom of Mr. Mulinder’s kayak, and the group’s guide freed it with his oar. The octopus, alive and apparently unhurt, swam away.

“I don’t know who got a bigger fright: the seal, me or the octopus,” he said.
