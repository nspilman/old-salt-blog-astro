Shipwrecks tend to be pretty stationary. They are not prone to wandering about.  Now, however, an Elizabethan shipwreck dating from 1574, which was recovered from the River Thames in 2003, is on the move.  The remains of  the 16th-century “Gresham Ship’’ are set to be transported 160 miles to Stoney Cove in Leicestershire on June 1 and lowered into a lake.  The move is being  co-ordinated by the Nautical Archaeological Society, which will use the ship as an “underwater classroom’’ to train the next generation of nautical archaeologists.

The wreck is also known as the [Princes Channel wreck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Channel_Wreck) as it was found in the Princes Channel at the mouth of the Thames estuary. The wreck is more popularly known as the Gresham Ship as the guns on board the vessel featured a grasshopper insignia, which was the motif of by Sir Thomas Gresham, founder of the Royal Exchange.
