Nina & Pinta

Replicas of two of Christopher Columbus’ ships, the [*Nina* and *Pinta*](http://www.thenina.com/), will be visiting Hudson, Wisconsin. The ships will be open to visitors at the Hudson Docks from Friday, Aug. 6, through Monday, Aug. 16.

[Columbus Ship Replicas Come To Wisconsin](http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/98910019.html)

*The “Nina” was built without power tools. Archaeology magazine calls it “the most historically correct Columbus replica ever built.” The “Pinta” was recently built to accompany the “Nina.”*  
  
*Columbus sailed the orignal “Nina” across the Atlantic on his three voyages to the New World beginning in 1492. The “Pinta” was on the first voyage, as was the “Santa Maria.”*

*The ships will be open every day from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Admission is $8.00 for adults, $6.00 for seniors and $5.00 for students.*
