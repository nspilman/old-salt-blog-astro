![sevenseas1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/08/sevenseas1.jpg)Movie director [Steven Spielberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg) is putting his $200 million, 282′ mega-yacht, *[Seven Seas](http://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/the-superyacht-directory/seven-seas--55439#overview)*, up for sale, [reportedly because it is too small.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3190652/I-m-gonna-need-bigger-boat-Steven-Spielberg-selling-120million-282ft-mega-yacht-small.html#i-bd3f5044a945e649) He is having a new yacht built, costing roughly $250 million, which, oddly, at 300′, is only 18′ longer than *Seven Seas*.

*Seven Seas* was built by [Oceanco Yachts](http://www.oceancoyacht.com/) in the Netherlands and is only five years old. As described by the [The Richest](http://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celebrity-lifestyle/yachts/steven-spielberg-megayacht/): *The Seven Seas has accommodation and luxury amenities for 12 guests along with a crew of 26, including a private owner’s deck centered on a large master stateroom with a study and private deck area with a Jacuzzi. Other luxury touches include a helipad, fully equipped gymnasium, a spa and massage room and another, indoor cinema. Special stability systems allow the yacht to travel smoothly in any weather at 20 knots so the director doesn’t get jostled while viewing his latest masterpiece.*

In 2013, Spielberg, his wife Kate Capshaw, and their seven children took the yacht on a 30,000-mile round-the-world cruise, stopping at some of his most notable film locations. They included Shanghai where he shot *Empire Of The Sun* and Hawaii where he made *Jurassic Park*.  When not using *Seven Seas*, Spielberg has offered it for charter for $1.3 million per week.

As opulent as Spielberg’s *Seven Seas* may be*,* it is ranked at 59 out of the top 200 largest yachts by [Boat International.](http://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/the-register/top-200-largest-yachts--25027?page=15)  Currently, the largest private yacht is *Azzam* at 590′, believed to be owned by the President of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Currently under construction, however, is a yacht that will dwarf them all — the *[Triple Deuce](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/11/sport/worlds-biggest-superyacht-triple-deuce-billion-dollar/),* which will be 728′ long and is expected to cost over $1 billion when it is delivered some time around 2018.
