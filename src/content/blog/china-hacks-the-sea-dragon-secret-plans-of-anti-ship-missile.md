![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/submissle.jpg)The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/china-hacked-a-navy-contractor-and-secured-a-trove-of-highly-sensitive-data-on-submarine-warfare/2018/06/08/6cc396fa-68e6-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html?utm_term=.66f1f7ccb60b) has reported that Chinese government hackers have broken into the computers of a Navy contractor, stealing more than 600 GB of highly sensitive data related to undersea warfare — including secret plans to develop a supersonic anti-ship missile for use on U.S. submarines by 2020. The stolen data includes, “signals and sensor data, submarine radio room information relating to cryptographic systems, and the Navy submarine development unit’s electronic warfare library.”  The data also includes plans to the Sea Dragon. 

What is the Sea Dragon? It is apparently some sort of top-secret supersonic submarine-launched anti-ship missile, (not to be confused with the Navy MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter.) Beyond that, little is known publically. The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/china-hacked-a-navy-contractor-and-secured-a-trove-of-highly-sensitive-data-on-submarine-warfare/2018/06/08/6cc396fa-68e6-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html?utm_term=.cb340171c968) reports, that *the Defense Department, citing classification levels, has released little information about Sea Dragon other than to say that it will introduce a “disruptive offensive capability” by “integrating an existing weapon system with an existing Navy platform.” The Pentagon has requested or used more than $300 million for the project since late 2015 and has said it plans to start underwater testing by September.*

The data hacked with the Sea Dragon plans is also considered potentially damaging. [The Drive](http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/21414/what-supersonic-anti-ship-missile-did-china-hack-from-the-u-s-navy) reports: *The loss of the Navy’s current electronic warfare library is especially troubling as that type of information is considered among the most sensitive data the Pentagon gathers and is critical to countering enemy defensive networks and allowing U.S. assets to survive in contested territory. This theft paired with information on sensor data that potentially collects that information is especially damning as the enemy can figure out not just what the Navy knows, but exactly how they have come to know it.*

How could the Chinese get their hands on such sensitive information? They are said to have hacked the computers of a Navy contractor. The Chinese stole highly sensitive data from the contractor’s unclassified network, raising serious questions about how the Navy handles secret information. 

This is not the first time that Chinese hackers have made off with secret information and plans. In the past they have stolen designs for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; the advanced Patriot PAC-3 missile system; the Army anti-ballistic missile system known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense; and the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ships.
