Schooner Heritage in better times

At the end of June, we [posted that the Maine windjammer passenger fleet](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/06/maine-windjammers-face-uncertain-season-with-pandemic/) faced an uncertain season due to the pandemic.  Shortly thereafter, the State of Maine, working with the [Maine Windjammer Association](https://sailmainecoast.com/) and others, agreed on a [set of rules and guidelines](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/news-details.html?id=2599576) to allow overnight windjammer cruises to start in July. That would generally be good news, except that the rules were very tough. The toughest was probably the state’s requirement that all out-of-state visitors must have a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours of travel.

So, while it may be possible to cruise this year, many, and indeed most, windjammers have decided to keep their sails folded and not sail in the 2020 sailing season.

Of the eight schooners represented by the [Maine Windjammer Association](https://sailmainecoast.com/), six have decided not to sail in 2020.  The schooners [*Lewis R. French*](https://schoonerfrench.com/?utm_source=MWA&utm_medium=Weblink&utm_campaign=Fleet-Page), [*Heritage*](https://schoonerheritage.com/?utm_source=MWA&utm_medium=Weblink&utm_campaign=Fleet-Page), [*Victory Chimes*](https://www.victorychimes.com/2020august), [*Angelique*](https://www.sailangelique.com/coronavirus/), *[American Eagle](https://www.schooneramericaneagle.com/a-note-from-capt-john-regarding-covid-19/)*, and the [*Mary Day*](https://schoonermaryday.com/coronavirus/) have canceled their 2020 seasons. 

The schooners [*Stephen Taber*](https://www.stephentaber.com/trips) and the [*Ladona*](https://www.schoonerladona.com/trips) are offering shortened seasons, but are still sailing. 

Other Maine windjammers are showing a similar pattern. [Maine Windjammer Cruises](https://www.mainewindjammercruises.com/)‘ schooners [*Grace Bailey* and *Mercantile*](https://www.mainewindjammercruises.com/schedules/schedules-reservations/grace-bailey-mercantile/) are not taking reservations for 2020, while the schooner [*Mistress*](https://www.mainewindjammercruises.com/schedules/schedules-reservations/mistress/) is still offering 2020 cruises.

The windjammer [*J. & E. Riggins*](https://www.mainewindjammer.com/) has also canceled its 2020 season.
