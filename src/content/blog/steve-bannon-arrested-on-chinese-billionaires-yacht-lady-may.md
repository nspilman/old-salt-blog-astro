Bannon has been charged with [defrauding donors to a private fund-raising effort called We Build the Wall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/nyregion/steve-bannon-indicted.html), which was intended to bolster one of the president’s signature initiatives: erecting a barrier on the Mexican border. Bannon is accused of stealing more than $1 million from donors.

Steve Bannon is a business partner of the yacht’s owner, Guo Wengui, also known as Miles Kwok. Guo is reported to be one of China’s most-wanted, accused of myriad crimes by the Chinese government, including paying bribes and sexual assault. He maintains his innocence, saying the charges are politically motivated.

Guo is currently seeking political asylum in the United States, where he reportedly avoided deportation by the Trump administration after the president learned [Guo was a member of Mar-a-Lago](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article232973237.html). The [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article232973237.html) reports that some allege that Guo is, in fact, a Chinese spy.
