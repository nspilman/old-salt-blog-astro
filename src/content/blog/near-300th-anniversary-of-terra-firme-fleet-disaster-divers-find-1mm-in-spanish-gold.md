![1715gold](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/08/1715gold.jpg)On July 30, 1715 the Spanish Terra Firme and New Spain fleets, bound from Havana to Spain, were hit by a hurricane off the coast of Florida.  Eleven ships were blown up on to the reefs and sank. Only one ship escaped. More than 1,000 sailors lost their lives.

[On July 17, Eric Schmitt and his family were diving on the fleet flagship, *Capitana,*](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/divers-dig-1-million-sunken-treasure-180956112/?no-ist) when they found a trove of 52 Spanish gold coins, 40 feet of gold chain, and 110 silver coins and buttons all worth over one million dollars. The discovery was kept quiet for a few weeks to coincide with the 300th anniversary of the disaster. Who receives the benefit of the gold is unclear. The Schmitt family was diving under a contract with [1715 Fleet-Queens Jewels](http://www.1715treasurefleet.com/index.php), a Florida company that holds exclusive rights to searching the wrecks.
