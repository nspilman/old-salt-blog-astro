We have previously posted about [“the original social network, “messages in bottles,](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/09/30/the-original-social-networking-harold-hackett-and- ) as well as [lobster pot tags from New England that broke loose during the “Perfect Storm”](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/15/first-tsunami-flotsam-arrives-on-west-coast-perfect-storm-flotsam-discovery-in-ireland/) which drifted to a beach in Ireland. Now, we hear of a fishing boat named the *Queen Bee*, from which two men were thrown from off Nantucket, Massachusetts in 2008. The men swam a mile to shore and the *Queen Bee* apparently disappeared. Or not. Recently, the boat was found 3,500 miles away, off the coast of Spain. Thanks to Phil Leon for passing the story along.
