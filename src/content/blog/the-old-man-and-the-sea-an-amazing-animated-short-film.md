In 1951, Ernest Hemingway wrote [*The Old Man and the Sea.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea)  Published in 1952, the novella won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and was cited by the Nobel Committee when it awarded the [Nobel Prize in Literature to Hemingway in 1954](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/). It was Hemingway’s last major work of fiction to be published during his lifetime.

*The Old Man and the Sea* tells the story of Santiago, an aging fisherman, who struggles to catch a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. In 1999, a paint-on-glass animated short film of *[The Old Man and the Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea_%281999_film%29),* directed by Aleksandr Petrov, was released. The film took two years to make and required over 29,000 hand painted glass frames, slightly more individual paintings than the number of words used by Hemingway to compose the novella.  Petrov’s animation [won many awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea_%281999_film%29#Awards), including the [Academy Award for Animated Short Film for 1999](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Animated_Short_Film).  Now by the magic of the internet, Petrov’s animated short film is available on Youtube.  A beautiful film. Definitely worth watching.
