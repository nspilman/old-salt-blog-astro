![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/11/sailrocket-2.jpg)Just six days after [Paul Larsen in the Vestas Sailrocket 2 broke the world speed record](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/11/20/vestas-sailrocket-shatters-500m-speed-sailing-record-averaging-59-23-knots/) in Walvis Bay, Namibia, subject to confirmation by WSSRC, he has now sailed a 500 meter course at an average speed of 65.42 knots!  This is close to ten knots faster than the previous record set by kiteboarder Rob Douglas of 55.65 knots – a record that stood for two years.  In just over a week, the Sailrocket 2 has broken that record three times. The Sailrocket 2 peaked at 68 knots during the record breaking run, sailing in winds of 27 to 32 knots.   Yesterday, [we posted about the attempt to by the kiteboarding community](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/11/24/kite-with-the-wind-a-quest-to-reclaim-the-world-speed-record/) to reclaim the record.  The Sailrocket team has now set the bar very, very high. Thanks to Nunzio for passing on the news.
