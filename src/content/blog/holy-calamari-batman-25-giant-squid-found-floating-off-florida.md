*Robert Benz spotted the giant squid while fishing with friends Joey Asaro and Paul Peroulakis. They somehow managed to haul the enormous dying squid onto the back of their 23-foot boat.*

*“I thought we definitely need to bring it in, because no one’s going to believe us if we don’t,” Benz was quoted as saying in the press release. “I didn’t want to leave it out there and just let the sharks eat it.”*
