![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/slider3.jpg)The first documented European to land on Australia was the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon aboard the *Duyfken* in March 1606.   *Duyfken* was also one of the first Dutch ships to got directly to the East Indies to load spices.  The Dutch would long dominate the trade with the Spice Islands and ruled the Dutch East indies, now Indonesia, for centuries.

In October 2012, the Dutch tall ships the bark *[Europa](http://www.barkeuropa.com/)* and topsail schooner *[Oosterschelde](http://www.oosterschelde.nl/welkom-op-de-website-van-driemastschoener-Oosterschelde.html)* will again sail the ancient trade routes.  The *Oosterschelde* will sail from Rotterdam and rendezvous in Capetown with the *Europa* which will be returning from an Antarctic cruise. Other sailing vessels may be joining the rendezvous including the two mast herring drifter *[Tecla](http://www.tecla.nl/)*.  From Capetown they will sail together to Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion, Fremantle and on to Jakarta. From there they will set a course for Adelaide, Melbourne and Hobart.  The ships are looking for voyage crew members to join the ships. Follow the link below for more information. Thanks to Dexter Donham at [Sailing Ship Adventures](http://www.sailingshipadventures.com/) for pointing the expedition out.
