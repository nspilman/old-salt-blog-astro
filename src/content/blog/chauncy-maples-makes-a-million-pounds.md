![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/stamp.jpg)In June [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?p=13941&preview=true) about the missionary/hospital steamer, the [Chauncy Maples](http://www.chauncymaples.org/default.php).   Launched in 1901, she is the oldest ship in Africa.   She is being restored to return to duty as a traveling clinic on the 560 kilometer long Lake Malawi.   The [Chauncy Maples Malawi Trust](http://www.chauncymaples.org/about/default.php) has been attempting to raise £2 million to fund the project.  Last Friday, [Thomas Miller, a London-based specialist insurance company](http://www.marinelink.com/news/renovate-africas-thomas334561.aspx), which has been spearheading the drive, announced that they are half way to their goal, having raised over £1m pounds.

*Thomas Miller is the sponsor of the Chauncy Maples Malawi Trust, a UK charity which is renovating the 19th century ship as a clinic to provide essential medical services to the lakeside people of Malawi. The Malawi Ministry of Health, the owner of Chauncy Maples, has committed more than £250,000 to the project, actively planning the renovation work in conjunction with the contractor.*

*Hugo Wynn-Williams, chairman of Thomas Miller, commented:*

*“Reaching the halfway stage in only three months since the project launched in June is a truly magnificent effort by our community. I have been genuinely surprised by the very positive response not just to fundraising but also the desire to participate in all sorts of ways.*

*“Since the outset we have wanted to celebrate our anniversary with something better than a party – this has exceeded our wildest dreams.”*

*Mark Holford of Thomas Miller explained how the funds raised thus far were already being put to good use:*

*“In the past two weeks, work has commenced in Malawi in stripping out the ship in preparation for major hull work in a dry dock in October. Our next step is to persuade the world’s maritime manufacturers to donate the £800,000 worth of parts necessary for the renovation work.”*

*Eighty-five per cent of the £1 million raised so far has come from Thomas Miller, which donated £250,000, and its business community.*
