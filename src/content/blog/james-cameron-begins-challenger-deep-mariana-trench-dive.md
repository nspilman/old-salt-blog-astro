![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/20DIVE-articleInline.jpg)Last week [we posted about James Cameron’s preparation](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/03/19/james-camerons-vertical-torpedo-to-dive-to-the-challenger-deep/) for his attempt to dive to the bottom of the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench. Reports are that he is now attempting the dive in his one man submarine, described as a “vertical torpedo.”  If successful he will be the first person in over 50 years and only the third person in history to dive to the bottom of the the Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the ocean.  Thanks to Phil Leon of the heads-up.
