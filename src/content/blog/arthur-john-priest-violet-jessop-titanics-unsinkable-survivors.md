[Arthur John Priest](http://www.geni.com/people/Arthur-John-Priest/6000000016047600622) was a stoker, or fireman, on the RMS *Titanic.* His job was to shovel coal into the ship’s boilers.  He survived the *Titanic’s* sinking of 1912. He also was aboard the RMS *Olympic,* the sistership to the *Titanic,* when she collided with *HMS Hawke* in 1911.

Priest was also aboard the *Britannic,* the third sistership to the *Olympica* and the *Titanic* when she hit a mine and sank in 1916. Priest also survived the World War I losses of the *[Alcantara](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/two-ships-sink-in-north-sea-battle)* and *Donegal*. He once claimed that he was forced to retire from the sea by these disasters because no one wished to sail with him.  Priest died at the age of 48 of pneumonia in Southampton.

Violet Jessop

More famous and longer lived than Priest was [Violet Jessop](http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/violet-constance-jessop.html), a nurse who was coincidentally also onboard the RMS *Olympic* during the collision with *HMS Hawk* and during the sinkings of both the *Titanic* and the **Britannic**.  Ms, Jessop died of heart failure at the age of 84.  Characters based on Ms. Jessop have appeared in two movies and a play about the sinking of the Titanic.
