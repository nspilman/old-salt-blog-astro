The United Kingdom consists of over six thousand islands, and one has just come on the market. Situated just off the coast of Wales near Cardiff, Sully Island is up for sale for £95,000 (roughly $150,000 USD). Once the haunt of pirates, the 14.5 acre island is set 400 metres from the coast, and only accesible for a few hours a day.
