![Yacht-Capsizes-in-Washington](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Yacht-Capsizes-in-Washington.jpg)How is your day going? It has to be better than the unfortunate folks at [Northern Marine](http://www.northernmarine.com/home.php) in Anacortes, Washington, who had a 90′ expedition motor yacht roll over and sink when it was launched last Sunday. [Rescuers and first responders had to smash a window open and pull five men trapped](http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/6-people-rescued-capsized-boat/nfy8j/) inside a $10 million capsized yacht. Fortunately, no one was hurt and no oil was leaked. [The yacht has since been righted and the Coast Guard is investigating](http://www.columbian.com/news/2014/may/21/yacht-pulled-upright-sinking-cause-unknown/) the cause of the casualty. Two videos of the capsize and rescue after the page break. Thanks to Robert Kennedy for contributing this post.
