![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ncl1.jpg)The press release from the [Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA)](https://cruising.org/) was clear — [the cruise industry is now shut down. No more cruising from the United States.](https://www.eturbonews.com/567034/cruise-industry-is-now-shut-down-no-more-cruising-in-the-united-states/) CLIA is the world’s largest cruise industry trade association, representing more than 50 cruise lines. Their [statement](https://cruising.org/news-and-research/press-room/2020/march/clia-covid-19-toolkit) read in part:

*“CLIA ocean-going cruise lines will be voluntarily and temporarily suspending cruise ship operations from and to U.S. ports of call for 30 days as public health officials and the U.S. Government continue to address COVID-19.*

*CLIA cruise line members are voluntarily and temporarily suspending operations from the U.S. as we work to address this public health crisis,” said Kelly Craighead, President and CEO, CLIA. “This is an unprecedented situation. Our industry has taken responsibility for protecting public health for more than 50 years, working under the guidance of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and prides itself on its ability to deliver exceptional vacation experiences for guests, as well as meaningful employment opportunities for crew. This has been a challenging time, but we hope that this decision will enable us to focus on the future and a return to normal as soon as possible.”*

The government of Canada also announced that it will [defer the start of the cruise ship season in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/transport-canada/news/2020/03/government-of-canada-announces-intention-to-defer-the-start-of-cruise-ship-season-in-canada-as-covid-19-response-measure.html), from April 2, 2020, to July 1, 2020, at the earliest for ships capable of carrying more than 500 passengers and crew members. Due to cabotage laws, this effectively shuts down the US Alaskan cruise trade until Canadian ports are reopened.

The shutdowns are impacting more than just the North American cruise markets. [Princess and Viking Cruises](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/03/viking-and-princess-temporarily-suspend-cruise-operations/) had previously announced a world-wide suspension of cruise operations for up to two months. [Costa Line and Aida Cruises, owned by Carnival, and UK-based Fred Olsen Cruise Lines](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article241168306.html), which sail mostly in Europe, are also temporarily suspending operations, as are a number of other carriers including Celebrity Cruises, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Line, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, Oceania Cruises, and Disney Cruises and Windstar.
