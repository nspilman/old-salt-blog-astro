![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/griffiths.jpg)In June, [we posted about the upcoming unveiling of a headstone](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/06/headstone-honor-legendary-naval-architect-john-w-griffiths/) for the brilliant, but largely forgotten, American naval architect [John Willis Griffiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Griffiths). This Saturday, July 23rd, the [National Maritime Historical Society](http://www.seahistory.org/) will unveil the headstone at Griffiths’ previously unmarked grave in Queens at the [Linden Hill United Methodist Cemetery](http://lindenhillumcemeteryny.com/) at 10:30 am.  Griffiths was a pioneer in both sail and steam, a designer, a shipbuilder, a hydrodynamicist, a writer and an editor. Of all his accomplishments he is best remembered as the father of the clipper ship. Here is a short documentary honoring Griffiths, done to raise money for the new headstone, narrated by Captain Matt Carmel.
