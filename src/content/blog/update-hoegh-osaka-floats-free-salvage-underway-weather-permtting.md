![hoeghosaka](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/01/hoeghosaka.jpg)One week ago the car carrier [*Höegh Osaka* was intentionally beached](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/01/update-hoegh-osaka-grounded-deliberately-salvage-planning-underway/) on Bramble Bank off the Solent in the UK after the ship developed an unexplained list.  Last Wednesday, the ship floated free from the bank. It is still, however, floating with a severe list of roughly 50 degrees. Salvors plan on pumping out close to 3,000 of ballast water which should reduce the list. Once the ship is brought closer to upright it will be towed to Southhampton.  The salvaeg operations have been delayed by high winds. [Last night winds of over 70 knots](http://www.islandecho.co.uk/news/hoegh-osaka-moves-overnight-strong-winds) caused the ship to drag at anchor approximately 100m. The ship is reported to be carrying 1,400 cars and 70 to 80 pieces of construction equipment. So far there have been no oil leaks or other pollution reported.
