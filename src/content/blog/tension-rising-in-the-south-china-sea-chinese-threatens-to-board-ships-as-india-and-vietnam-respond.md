Surin Pitsuwan, secretary-general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said the [Chinese plan was a “very serious turn of events”.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/30/us-china-seas-idUSBRE8AT01B20121130)

India and Vietnam have both responded by threatening to deploy naval patrols to protect their vessels operating in the contested region.  Vietnam has complained of Chinese interference with oil exploration operations and fishing. [Vietnam has announced marine patrols](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/04/us-china-sea-idUSBRE8B303M20121204) of their own in the disputed waters which will begin on January 25th. [India’s Navy chief Admiral D K Joshi  has also announced that India will deploy naval assets](http://www.indianexpress.com/news/ready-to-protect-indian-interests-in-south-china-sea-navy-chief/1040119/) to protect its interests in the region.

[The Next Global Hotspot to Worry About](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/11/the-next-global-hotspot-to-worry-about/265763/)

Earlier this year [we posted about a standoff](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/12/standoff-in-the-south-china-sea-philippine-and-chinese-ships-face-off-at-scarborough-shoal/) between China and the Philippines over fishing rights on the Scarborough Shoal, a series of islands and an atoll, which is claimed by the Philippines, China and Taiwan.

In September [a dispute between China and Japan over uninhabited islands](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/territorial-disputes/index.html) in the East China Sea resulted in anti-Japanese protests across China.
