![anthem3](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/02/anthem3.jpg)We [posted this morning](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/02/anthem-of-the-seas-a-storm-at-sea-and-on-twitter/) about the severe storm encountered by the Royal Caribbean cruise ship, [Anthem of the Seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Anthem_of_the_Seas), off Cape Hatteras. As of this morning, the ship was bound for Port Canaveral but was being delayed by weather according to a tweet on the [RCLcorp Twitter page](https://twitter.com/RCLCorp). Then shortly after 11 AM, RCL announced that they were turning the ship around and that it will return to Cape Liberty, its terminal in Bayonne, New Jersey, in New York harbor. Thanks to Irwin Bryan for the heads-up.
