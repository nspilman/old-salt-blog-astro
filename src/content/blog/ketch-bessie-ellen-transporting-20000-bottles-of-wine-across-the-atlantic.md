*The sailing ship being used, the 120-foot (36.5 meter) Bessie-Ellen was built in 1904 in Portsmouth, England, and is one of the last remaining vessels of its kind.*

*Frederic Albert CEO of CMTV, the maritime transport company behind the voyage, explained that the reason for using a sailing ship was to reduce carbon emissions and transport wine in a more ecologically friendly way. Though the bottles have already been sold, Albert states that on the ship’s arrival on August 26, a reception committee will be held in Montreal and visitors will have a chance to tour the ship itself and sample a glass of wine. Previously CMTV has transported wine from the Languedoc region in France to Ireland aboard its own fleet of sailing ships; the company claims this made it the first of its kind in France to make a public commitment to a sustainable development project.*
