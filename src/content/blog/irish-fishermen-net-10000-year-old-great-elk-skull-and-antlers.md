![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/09/elk.jpg)Two Northern Irish fishermen were fishing for pollan, a whitefish native to Ireland, in Lough Neagh. Instead, fishermen Raymond McElroy and Charlie Coyle netted the antlers and skull of a Great Elk, a species which disappeared from Ireland 10,500 to 11,000 years ago. The nearly intact skull, with its antlers still attached, measures 6 feet across. Four years ago, a lower jaw bone of a Great Elk was pulled from Lough Neagh in almost the same spot, which may suggest that it belonged to the same deer as this skull and antlers.

Gizmodo reports that the “Great Elks were truly awesome, measuring about 7 feet (2 meters) tall, with males featuring antlers up to 10 feet wide. These antlers were likely the result of sexual selection, as they were not suitable for male-on-male combat. In terms of purpose, these antlers likely intimidated rivals and attracted females, according to the University of California Museum of Paleontology. The massive antlers posed a considerable burden for Great Elk males; sitting atop their heads, the antlers weighed in excess of 60 to 90 pounds (28 to 40 kg).”

The skull and antlers are currently being stored in McElroy’s garage until local authorities figure out what to do with them.
