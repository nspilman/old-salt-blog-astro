![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/01/doggydaycare.jpg)In addition to more than 24 people who have died in the terrible Australian bushfires, an incredible number of animals have also perished. Estimates of wildlife deaths range from [millions](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/australia/australia-fire-wildlife-deaths-intl-hnk-scli/index.html) to a [billion animals](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-01-07/1-billion-animals-have-died-australian-bushfires-ecologist-estimates). More than 25.5 million acres of land — an area the size of South Korea — have been razed by the fires. 

Against this horrific backdrop, here is a minor bit of good news. As [we posted previously](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/01/australian-navy-ships-evacuate-1000-people-trapped-by-bushfires/), the Australian Navy landing ship [HMAS *Choules*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Choules), supported by the training ship, MV *Sycamore*, recently evacuated 1,000 tourists and residents stranded by bushfires in Mallacoota, Australia. Along with the evacuees also came 135 dogs, two cats, two birds, and a rabbit.  

The crew of the *Choules* divided off a section of a vehicle deck to provide a sort of dog-dare care for the dogs. Accommodations for the cats and the rabbit were provided separately. [For a video of the shipboard kennel click here.](https://youtu.be/PegNWa0rpLk)
