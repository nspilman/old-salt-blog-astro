![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/virtualportholepeach8108050.jpg)The 150 windowless inside staterooms on the new 4,000 passenger cruise ship, [*Disney Dream*,](http://disneycruise.disney.go.com/ships-activities/ships/dream/) will have something unusual – virtual portholes. High def cameras pointing port, starboard, fore and aft will transmit the appropriate view to the cabin “port holes” which is actually a 42 inch video monitor.  Sounds like a great idea.   What I am not sure about is the addition of “Disney magic” which will added composited images of various Disney characters flying by the port hole from time to time. Personally a view of the ocean is just fine without Goofy, Peter Pan or Dumbo floating by.  But that is just me.  The *Disney Dream* goes into service in January 2011.
