Whether in quarantine or not, the [Monterey Bay Aquarium](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/) live shark cam is a great spot to escape to. The cam features sevengill sharks, leopard sharks, spiny dogfish, and the elusive Pacific angel shark in an aquarium that replicates the Monterey Bay habitat. Designed with sharks in mind, the exhibit’s 90-foot-long hourglass shape gives the big sharks room to glide and turn. If you watch carefully, you may also see big skates and bat rays pass by the window, as well as sharks.  Plus, keep your eyes peeled for sturgeon coasting through the water, rockfish and giant sea bass relaxing by the reef, and flatfish nestling on the sandy seafloor.
