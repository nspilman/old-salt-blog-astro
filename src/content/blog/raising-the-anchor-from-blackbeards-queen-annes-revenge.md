Until I saw the video I didn’t grasp just how large this anchor is.  It is believed to be from the [pirate Blackbeard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard)‘s flagship, the *[Queen Anne’s Revenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Anne's_Revenge)*, which ran aground in 1718 while trying to enter Old Topsail Inlet in North Carolina, now known as Beaufort Inlet.   The wreck of what is believed to be Blackbeard’s ship was  discovered in 1996 by Intersal Inc., a private research firm.  To learn more about the excavation go to  –   [Queen Anne’s Revenge Online](http://www.qaronline.org/).
