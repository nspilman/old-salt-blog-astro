In March of last year we posted about the attempts to scuttle [HMAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Adelaide_\(FFG_01\)) *[Adelaide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Adelaide_\(FFG_01\))* as an artificial reef off New South Wales.  (See [HMAS Adelaide – A Hard Ship to Sink](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/03/28/hmas-adelaide-%E2%80%93-a-hard-ship-to-sink/) )  “*She was scheduled to be scuttled … but an environmental action group has managed to stop the scuttling over concerns regarding possible PCBs in her electrical wiring and lead paint on the ship. This is notwithstanding that there was never any reported lead paint used on the ship and that tests performed on behalf of the Australian government showed no evidence of PCBs*.”   After transiting the courts,  HMAS *Adelaide* was finally sunk.   It is hoped that the wreck will become an artificial reef that will generate millions of dollars in revenue for New South Wales.   The scuttling was delayed for one final time by [a pod of dolphins](http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/dolphins-hold-up-hmas-adelaide-scuttling-20110413-1ddad.html) who were coaxed out of the area before the scuttling charges were set off.
