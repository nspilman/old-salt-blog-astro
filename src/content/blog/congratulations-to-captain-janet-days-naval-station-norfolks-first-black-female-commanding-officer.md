Congratulations to [Captain Janet Days](https://cnrma.cnic.navy.mil/About/Leadership/Bio-Detail/Article/2965129/xo/) due to [take command as Naval Station Norfolk’s 51st commanding officer](https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/norfolk/naval-station-norfolk-to-welcome-first-black-female-commanding-officer/) in a change of command ceremony today. Captain Days is the first Black woman commanding officer of the world’s largest naval base.

Days will relieve Capt. David Dees, who will then assume duties as the chief of staff for commander, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic.

It is not lost on her that few decades ago, there were few positions in the Navy available for a Black person. Her dedication to the military dates back her the service of her father, George Hanks.

“I watched a strong role model as I was growing up,” Days said of her father, “and it was in my father.”

At the start of Black History Month, ahead of the ceremony, Days explained how to frame the past.

“It’s how we tell that history, how we understand that history,” Days said, “and how that history is not an outlier to American history.”

[Naval Station Norfolk](https://cnrma.cnic.navy.mil/Installations/NAVSTA-Norfolk/) covers more than 6,200 acres, with more than 600 facilities and 326 tenant commands. It supports 63 ships, 188 aircraft, and 18 squadrons, employing over 67,000 personnel, including military and civilian personnel.

Days, a Chicago-native, graduated from Old Dominion University in 1999 with a bachelor of science in business, summa cum laude. She also holds a master of business administration from the Naval Postgraduate School and is a graduate of the Joint and Combined Warfighting School at Joint Forces Staff College.

Throughout her naval career, Days has served aboard various ships, including USS *Simon Lake*, USS *Mahan*, and USS *Forrest Sherman*.

Days has deployed twice, once to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility to conduct theater security cooperation and a second time to the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility to conduct counter-narcotics operations. Days also served as the executive officer and commanding officer of USS *McFaul*.

In addition to her sea assignments, Days has served on the joint staff, J7 joint, and coalition warfighting directorate as a military analyst and observer trainer augment to the deployable training team.

She deployed to Kabul, Afghanistan as the joint staff, J7 liaison officer to the International Security Assistance Force headquarters. Days has also worked as the director of maritime warfare at Surface Warfare Officers School, where she was responsible for the training and development of all surface warfare department heads.

Most recently, Days served as the executive officer of Naval Station Norfolk after a tour as the executive officer of Surface Warfare Schools Command in Newport, Rhode Island. She is also the first Black female to hold that position.
