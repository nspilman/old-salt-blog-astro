![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/rachel.jpg)The [schooner *Rachel B. Jackson* was on sale on E-Bay](http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=190401407610#ht_500wt_1182) this morning.   The minimum bid was $175,000 with a “Buy it Now” price of $225,000.    The bidding ended at around 8:00 this morning EST without any bids having been made.   The schooner is described on her [website](http://www.downeastsail.com/index.htm):

*The Rachel B. Jackson was built in Maine in 1982 and is a working replica of an 1890s coastal schooner. Her sturdily built mahogany planking, oak frames, pine decks, shining brass fittings and exotic wood cabinetry recall the workmanship of days gone by.*  
  
*She gives her passengers the rare opportunity to experience an authentic vessel of another era. Originally put into service as a training vessel at Mystic Seaport, the Rachel B. Jackson now tours the eastern seaboard from Maine to the Caribbean. She represented the State of Maine in the Tall Ships 2000 race from Bermuda to Boston then on to Halifax, NS. The Rachel B. Jackson was chartered by the National Geographic Society to do whale research off the coast of the Dominican Republic and she circumnavigated the world on a 3-year adventure.*

The *Rachel B. Jackson* has been for sale for some time. When we last [posted about her in 2008, she was offered  for sale for $350,000](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2008/10/24/the-business-of-raising-sails-on-a-maine-windjammer/).

In [the same post](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2008/10/24/the-business-of-raising-sails-on-a-maine-windjammer/) we also wrote about the *[Victory Chimes](http://www.victorychimes.com/)* which was also for sale. [She is still available](http://www.liveyachting.com/victory-chimes-2).  The 172′ three masted schooner is the only surviving example of the Chesapeake Ram type schooner in existence today. Her asking price has recently been reduced to $1,200,000.
