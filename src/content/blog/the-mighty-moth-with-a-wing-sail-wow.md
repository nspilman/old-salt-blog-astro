This video, which was [tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/SAILINGMAGAZINE) about by [Sailing Magazine](http://www.sailingmagazine.net/), stunned me. I had never seen an [International Moth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth_\(dinghy\)) class boat and had frankly never imagined a hydrofoil boat of this size zipping about like some sort of otherworldly water creature.   But enough verbiage. Just watch the video.
