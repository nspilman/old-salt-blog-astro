*A Finnish ferry has run aground while its captain was locked inside the ship’s bathroom.  The tourist ferry slammed onto a rock near the shore of Finland’s capital city Helsinki, coastguards said on Friday.  Officials said the captain of the boat had got stuck in the bathroom because of a jammed lock and had yelled for help.*

*One member of staff managed to slow the island-hopping tourist ferry down, but the vessel still crashed. Some of the 54 passengers were bruised and tableware on the boat was broken in the incident. There were no serious injuries reported from any of the passengers onboard.*
