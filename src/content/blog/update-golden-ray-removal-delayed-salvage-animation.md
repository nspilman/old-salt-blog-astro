Lasy week, we [posted that the removal of the capsized car carrier](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/07/update-facing-hurricanes-removal-of-car-carrier-golden-ray-delayed-by-coronavirus/) [*Golden Ray*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Golden_Ray) was being delayed by an outbreak of coronavirus in the salvage team on the heavy-lift barge [VB-10,000, nicknamed the “*Golden Arches.”*](http://www.vbar.com/vb10000/index.html)  Now with the onset of the hurricane season, the [salvage operation has been postponed](https://thebrunswicknews.com/breaking/golden-ray-demolition-put-on-hold/article_9340b209-60c5-531b-8414-f5d61d891e91.html) until at least October 1.  The *Golden Ray* capsized as it departed the Port of Brunswick, GA, carrying about 4,200 vehicles last September.

In the meantime, here is an animation of how the *Golden Ray* will be cut into eight sections that will be hauled off by barges to the scrapyard.
