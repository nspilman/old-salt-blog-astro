![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WSapphire.jpg)On Monday night, an explosion and fire erupted aboard the [*W-Sapphire*](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/9605645), a 751-foot-long, 82,000 DWT bulk carrier, in the Patapsco River, outbound from Baltimore harbor.

The Liberian-registered bulker had just loaded coal at CSX’s Curtis Bay terminal and was beginning its voyage to Mauritius when the explosion occurred around 6:30 p.m. local time. The ship had 23 crew members and two pilots on board. No injuries were reported. 

The explosion took place in the Patapsco River, less than half a mile from the remains of the Key Bridge, which [partially collapsed on March 26, 2024](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2024/03/baltimore-key-bridge-collapses-after-being-struck-by-container-ship-mv-dali/), after being struck by the container ship *Dali*. That tragedy killed six construction workers and left Baltimore Harbor closed for months. Demolition of the collapsed bridge is still ongoing, and a replacement is not expected before 2028.

Video and photos from the scene  showed heavy black smoke rising from the *W-Sapphire* after the explosion. Baltimore City Fire Department crews responded both by land and with fireboats, supported by tugboats that helped stabilise the ship. The fire was eventually extinguished while the ship remained afloat.

The Coast Guard set up a 2,000-yard safety zone around the site of the explosion,  effectively shutting down the Port of Baltimore’s main shipping channel.  The Fort McHenry Federal Channel reopened Tuesday evening, according to [Port of Baltimore officials.](https://x.com/portofbalt/status/1957883602382791005)

Authorities said the vessel will remain at a designated anchorage area until Coast Guard inspections are complete. The exact cause of the explosion and fire remains under investigation.

Maritime experts have long warned that coal is one of the riskiest bulk cargoes to transport by sea. Hazards include self-heating, methane gas buildup, spontaneous combustion, and dust explosions.
