![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/battleshiptexas.jpg)We have been following the continued slow disintegration of the historically rich, but budget poor, [*Battleship Texas*](http://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/battleship-texas) [for several years now](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=uss+texas). The over 100 year old battleship is the oldest remaining dreadnought battleship and only one of six surviving ships to have served in both World War I and World War II.  She is also continually on the verge of sinking at her berth in the Buffalo Bayou in Harris County, Texas.  

Recently, the Houston Chronicle reported, [Battleship Texas closed until further notice, crews working to repair leaks](http://m.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Battleship-Texas-closed-until-further-notice-11213115.php#item-39786). A week later,  the headline was more cheerful — [Battleship Texas Leaks Fixed, Retired Ship Reopens Saturday](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/texas/articles/2017-06-16/battleship-texas-leaks-fixed-retired-ship-reopens-saturday).  Now, the [media is reporting that the grand old ship is hunkering down for Tropical Storm Cindy](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2017/06/21/205686/battleship-texas-is-hunkering-down-for-cindy/), which is heading her way.

None of this is new. Back in 2012, we posted — [Update: 100 Year Old Battleship Texas Shutdown Indefinitely by Leaks](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/update-100-year-old-battleship-texas-shutdown-indefinitely-by-leaks/).  The good news is that all that is needed to save the old ship is money. That may also be the bad news.
