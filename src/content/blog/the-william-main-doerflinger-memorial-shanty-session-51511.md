Last week [we posted about the upcoming first William Main Doerflinger Memorial Shanty Session](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/05/12/the-william-main-doerflinger-memorial-sea-shanty-sessions-at-the-noble-maritime-collection-at-snug-harbor/) to be held at the [Noble Maritime Collection](http://www.noblemaritime.org/) at [Snug Harbor](http://www.snug-harbor.org/).    The shanty sing was well attended and the space was beautiful as well as historic.  The accoustics were quite good as well.    I was fortunate enough to be able to attend, to sing along and to shoot a bit of video.   Here is a short clip.
