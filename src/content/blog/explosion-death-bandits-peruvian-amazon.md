Aqua

Last October, we took a [five day cruise on the Amazon](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/10/in-the-amazon-basin-on-mv-la-amatista/) from [Iquitos, Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iquitos).  It was a fascinating trip. Iquitos is 2,000 nautical miles up the Amazon and yet is a deep water port with a [controlling draft of around 20 feet](https://www.searates.com/port/iquitos_pe.htm). With a population approaching a half million, it is also the largest city in the world which is not accessible by road or rail.  A small eco-tourist excursion cruise industry has developed in and around Iquitos.  While the cruises are wonderful, they are not wholly without risk.  The last few months have particularly difficult.

**Explosion on the *Aqua***

Last Saturday, there was an explosion on the [*Aqua*](http://www.cruisecritic.com/reviews/cruiseline.cfm?CruiseLineID=129) while the vessel was refueling in Iquitos on the Itaya River. The explosion caused the vessel to capsize and partially sink. Seven crew members were killed and 13 were injured. Eight of those injured suffered third-degree burns.  No passengers were aboard the ship when she exploded.  The *Aqua,* built in 2007, was 130 feet long and carried 24 passengers and a crew of 17. She was operated by [Aqua Expeditions](https://www.aquaexpeditions.com/).

**Bandits Attack Delfin Cruise’s *Amazon Discovery***

Two days before the explosion on the *Aqua,* a [gang of bandits boarded the *Amazon Discovery*](http://perureports.com/2016/07/15/armed-gang-robs-cruise-ship-perus-amazon/) off the village of Wasi, roughly two hours from Iquitos, and robbed passengers and crew of a reported $20,000. At less than a year old, the [*Amazon Discovery*](https://www.adventuresmithexplorations.com/amazon-discovery-amazon-luxury-ship-expert-review-deck-plan-photos) is one of the newer cruise ships operating in region. The ship is 169′ long and can accommodate 44 guests with a crew of 29. There are reports that the ship’s captain was pistol whipped by the bandits, but has recovered. No other members of the crew or passengers were harmed.

The last reported attacks on river cruises operating on the Peruvian Amazon were in 2009, when armed bandits boarded the *Aqua,* the vessel which exploded last week, in [two attacks over a roughly two week period](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1204815/Masked-men-guns-hand-grenades-rob-British-tourists-terrifying-dawn-raid-luxury-cruise-ship.html). That [gang was reported to have been pursued and captured by authorities](http://www.travelweekly.com/Cruise-Travel/Peru-steps-up-security-after-two-Amazon-river-ship-attacks).

**Fire on *La Estrella Amazonica***

Last April, [two American tourists, Larry and Christy Hammer, 74 and 72, died in a fire in their stateroom](http://perureports.com/2016/04/12/peru-two-americans-die-fire-amazon-river-cruise/) on the *[La Estrella Amazonica](http://www.ietravel.com/central-south-america/amazon-river-cruises/estrella-amazonica-ship-information)*.   The 139-foot boat is operated by [International Expeditions](http://www.ietravel.com/) has a capacity of 31 passengers according to the [company website](http://www.ietravel.com/central-south-america/amazon-river-cruises/estrella-amazonica-ship-information).
