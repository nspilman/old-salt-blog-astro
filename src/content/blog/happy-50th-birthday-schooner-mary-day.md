Roughly a year ago [we posted about the 75th anniversary of Captain Frank Swift buying laid up schooners](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/04/25/75-years-of-maine-windjammer-cruises/) which had previously carried stone, lumber, hay and all manner of goods, and began carrying vacationers to cruise in the Maine summers.  Many of these schooners are still sailing in the Maine “windjammer” fleet.  Since then, however, new schooners have been built specifically for the trade.  The first purpose-built schooner for the vacation trade was the *[Mary Day](http://schoonermaryday.com/)*, which is celebrating her 50th birthday this year.  She has sailed more than 150,000 miles and has carried more than 20,000 guests so far. May she sail for another 50 years!
