Private security guards shot and killed a Somali pirate during an attack on the the *MV Almezaan* off the coast of East Africa. This is believed to be the first killing of a pirate by armed private contractors.   The  *MV Almezaan* has been hijacked twice before.   Six other pirates were captured by EU naval forces and then released for lack of evidence despite being found in the same boat with the dead pirate.
