William Main Doerflinger Memorial Sea Shanty Sessions at the Noble Maritime Collection at Snug Harbor

This Saturday night, January7th, the [Mystic Seaport](http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&page_id=1) will be hosting a “[Chantey Blast and Pub Sing](http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&page_id=D4AE8CEF-1E4F-379B-6041AB6F8DCC623C)” from 1-5 PM in the Frohsinn Hall (aka the German Club), 54 Greenmanville Avenue, in Mystic CT as a fundraiser for the [33rd Annual Mystic Seaport Sea Music Festival](http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&page_id=C9BE0FCF-D86E-382C-FA65352B6393646D)  coming up in June.  The suggested donation is $15.

Around New York harbor, we have been fortunate to have had a monthly shanty (or chantey, if you prefer) sing for over a dozen years. In its current incarnation, it is called the [William Main Doerflinger Memorial Sea Shanty Sessions at the Noble Maritime Collection at Snug Harbor](http://www.noblemaritime.org/ongoing_programs.html).  William Doeflinger, who died in 2000, “collected” many well known sea shanties at the Sailor’s Snug Harbor retirement home in Staten Island, NY.  The shanty sing is held in one of the buildings where the old sailors sang their shanties for Doeflinger.  The acoustics are great and there is a sense of magic as the old songs are sung again where sailors from the great age of sail lived out their final days.  The shanty sessions are held on the third Sunday of every month.   from 2 to 5 PM, at the Noble Maritime Collection at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center at 1000 Richmond Terrace, building D, in Staten Island New York. For a short video see our post: [The William Main Doerflinger Memorial Shanty Session, 5/15/11](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/05/17/the-william-main-doerflinger-memorial-shanty-session-51511/)  
  
Fortunately Mystic and New York City are not the only places where folks regularly get together to sing sea songs. [In San Francisco, there are monthly shanty sings](http://www.nps.gov/safr/historyculture/chantey-sing.htm) from 8pm to midnight on the first Saturday of every month on a historic ship at the Hyde Street Pier.   Admission is free but reservations are required.
