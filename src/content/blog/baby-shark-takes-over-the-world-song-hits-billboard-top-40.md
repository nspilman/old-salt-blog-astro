And now for something completely different. Baby Shark has taken over the world! At least, the song, “Baby Shark” sure seems to be everywhere. The Youtube video of the song as performed by the Korean group Pinkfong has been viewed 2.2 billion times. That is billion, not million. Given that there are roughly 7 billion people on the planet, that is substantial. The song also ranked at 25 in Youtube’s all-time viewed videos. It also reached 32 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, the only time in recent memory that a kids’ song broke into the top 40. Here is the [Pinkfong dance version](https://youtu.be/XqZsoesa55w). (Warning, the song can become a dangerous earworm. Listen with care.)

What is a bit crazy is that the song and the dance that goes with it, is at least a decade old. The song is said to have been a longtime staple at youth summer camps and scouting retreats. A German version swam up in 2007, as “Kleiner Hai” (Little Shark). The song by Alexandra Müller, a.k.a. Alemuel, is slightly darker, borrowing directly from the theme music from the movie “Jaws”. In the Pingfong version, the swimmers get away. In the German version, they get eaten. 

The German video is especially fun, with very low-resolution clips but lots of enthusiasm. The kids’ song ends up feeling a bit like punk-rock slam dancing to bubblegum pop.
