![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/goldenraycap.jpg)The [final report](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/MAR2103.pdf) issued yesterday by the [National Transportation Safety Board Office](https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/20210914.aspx) (NTSB) summarizes what happened on Sept. 8, 2019, when the roll-on/roll-off vehicle carrier *Golden Ray* capsized as it transited outbound through St. Simons Sound near Brunswick, Georgia.

​​Less than 40 minutes after leaving port, the 656-foot-long *Golden Ray* began to heel rapidly to port during a 68-degree turn to starboard. Despite attempts by the pilot and crew to counter the heel, the rate of turn to starboard increased, and the vessel reached a heel of 60 degrees to port in under a minute before it grounded outside of the channel.

The NTSB determined the probable cause of the capsizing of the *Golden Ray* was the chief officer’s error entering ballast quantities into the stability calculation program, which led to his incorrect determination of the vessel’s stability and resulted in the *Golden Ray* having an insufficient righting arm to counteract the forces developed during a turn while transiting outbound from the Port of Brunswick through St. Simons Sound. …

The NTSB concluded the *Golden Ray* did not meet international stability standards at departure and possessed less stability than the chief officer calculated.

According to the NTSB, after the vessel capsized, open watertight doors allowed flooding into the vessel, which blocked the primary egress from the engine room, where four crewmembers were trapped. Two watertight doors had been left open for almost two hours before the accident. No one on the bridge ensured that the doors were closed before departing the port.

All 23 crew members and one pilot on board were rescued, including four engineering crew who were trapped in the vessel for nearly 40 hours. Two crew members sustained serious injuries. The *Golden Ray* sustained significant damage due to fire, flooding, and saltwater corrosion and was declared a total loss estimated at $62.5 million. An estimated $142 million worth of cargo, including more than 4,100 vehicles, was also lost.
