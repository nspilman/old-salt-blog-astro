*The federal Maritime Administration is scheduled to tow another ship from Virginia’s so-called “Ghost Fleet.”   A former Navy submarine rescue ship called [Kittiwake](http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/32/3213.htm) is set to become the 85th ship to be towed from the James River Reserve Fleet off of Fort Eustis.   The 1945-vintage ship is scheduled to be towed Thursday to Dominion Marine in Norfolk, where it will be cleaned before it is sunk as an artificial reef in the Cayman Islands.   That is scheduled to occur on July 4th.*
