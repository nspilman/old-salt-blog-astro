**Update**:  South African authorities are investigating whether the whale was [harassed before breaching](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/07/whale-crashes-onto-yacht-off-s-africa----was-it-harassed/1).

A breaching Southern Right Whale landed on top of a ten meter long sail boat off the coast of South Africa on Sunday.   The remarkable photos below were shot by a passenger on a nearby boat.   Fortunately no one was hurt on the sailboat and the whale swam away without apparent injury.  The sailboat however was considerably worse for the encounter.  Click on the thumbnails below to view larger images.
