In 1905, a young ship’s captain and his family set sail on the windjammer, Lady Rebecca, from Cardiff, Wales with a cargo of coal bound for Chile, by way of Cape Horn. Before they reach the Southern Ocean, the cargo catches fire, the mate threatens mutiny and one of the crew may be going mad. The greatest challenge, however, will prove to be surviving the vicious westerly winds and mountainous seas of the worst Cape Horn winter in memory. Told from the perspective of the Captain, his wife, a first year apprentice and an American sailor before the mast, [***Hell Around the Horn***](http://www.amazon.com/Hell-Around-the-Horn-ebook/dp/B0091614MM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1345734617&sr=8-1&keywords=hell+around+the+horn) is a story of survival and the human spirit in the last days of the great age of sail.

**Praise for Hell Around the Horn**:

*Rick Spilman brings alive the rough and tumble world of the windjammer with authentic and well-chosen detail, in a voice that is at once historically authentic, yet fresh as a salty gale. One hand for yourself and one for the ship on this fast-paced and gripping ride.* – [**Linda Collison**](http://www.lindacollison.com/), author of the Patricia MacPherson Nautical Adventures.

*Battling against endless contrary gales, constantly struck with disaster and tragedy, the crew of the Lady Rebecca encountered the same privations that hundreds of unsung sailors endured. As well as a story that grips with gathering tension, this book memorializes the gallant windjammer sailors of a largely forgotten era* – [**Joan Druett**](http://members.authorsguild.net/druettjo/index.htm), award winning nautical historian, novelist and author of Tupaia

*A much neglected period of sailing history is brought to life by Spilman’s fast-moving narrative and apt use of fact and detail.* – [**Alaric Bond**](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.php), author of the Fighting Sail series of novels.
