![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/scorpion.jpg)Last March, [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/03/queen-mary-operators-plan-to-remove-b-427-scorpion-submarine/) about a [Foxtrot-class Soviet-era submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxtrot-class_submarine) for sale in Long Beach, CA. Known as the *Scorpion*, the diesel-electric patrol submarine built in the Soviet Union in 1971, has been a museum ship berthed next to the hotel-ship [*Queen Mary*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Queen_Mary) for the past two decades.

Now, the [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-19/soviet-submarine-docked-next-to-queen-mary-sold-to-anonymous-buyer) is reporting that a [buyer for the old sub has been found](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/former-soviet-submarine-docked-in-california-to-be-sold/2019/11/19/e061fba4-0b35-11ea-8054-289aef6e38a3_story.html). The buyer, who remains anonymous,  is expected to remove the vessel by May. To do so will apparently require the removal of part of the stone breakwater which currently surrounds both ships. 

The submarine is owned by Palm Springs-based NewCo Pty Ltd., which is leasing it to Los Angeles real estate and development company Urban Commons, the operator of the *Queen Mary* as a hotel and tourist attraction.
