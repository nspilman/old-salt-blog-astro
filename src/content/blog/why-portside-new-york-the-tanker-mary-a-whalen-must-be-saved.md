[Portside New York](http://portsidenewyork.org/), based on the historic tanker *[Mary A. Whalen](http://www.portsidenewyork.org/mary_whalen.htm)*, has been putting on fantastic educational, cultural and and community programs and events on the Brooklyn waterfront front for the the last six years, without ever having a permanent berth.  Now PortSide is in crisis. It needs to find a permanent, publicly accessible berth or else it is likely to be shut down and the *Mary A. Whalen* scrapped.  Here is a short video that demonstrates what the New York waterfront would lose if we lost the PortSide New York & the tanker *Mary A. Whalen*.
