![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/nov_2009_image.jpg)Last January [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/19/the-clipper-ship-city-of-adelaide-ready-by-march-for-transport-to-australia/) that the composite clipper ship [*City of Adelaide*](http://cityofadelaide.org.au/) would begin her voyage by barge and then ship  to her namesake city in Australia by March, “if all goes well.”   As is not unusual is this sort of project, there have been delays.  The new departure date from Scotland is now October.  The ship, built in 1864, has been fumigated and is waiting on a barge to take her to Rotterdam, where she will be loaded onto a container ship for her return trip to Australia.

The *City of Adelaide* is the world’s oldest surviving composite clipper ship and is the only surviving sailing ship built to give regular passenger and cargo service between Europe and Australia.  She is five years older than the composite clipper, *Cutty Sark*.
