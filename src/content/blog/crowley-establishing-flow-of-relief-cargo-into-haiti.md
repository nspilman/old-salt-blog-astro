*Crowley Maritime Corporation, working under contract with the U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), is unloading Haiti relief cargo in Rio Haina, Dominican Republic, today. Fifty six of the 68 20-foot containers of water and meals-ready-to-eat (MREs) will be trucked across the border into Haiti.*  
  
*The remaining 12 loads aboard the container ship [Macajama](http://www.crowley.com/liner-shipping-services/vessel-marcajama.asp) will be transported by water to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and will be offloaded in an experimental lightering operation and delivered across a beach on Friday. If successful, future shipments could be made directly to Port-au-Prince.*

*The Crowley plan calls for the Macajama to anchor offshore near the port’s damaged south pier and near the exposed beach. Using a shipboard crane on the Macajama, the 12 remaining containers would be lowered onto a smaller vessel operated by G&G Shipping and delivered across the beach on wheels.*

*A team from Crowley’s TITAN Salvage subsidiary surveyed the port area Monday and determined that such an operation was possible. They also determined that it would be possible to establish a temporary docking structure on the beach using a Crowley 400-foot-long by 100-foot-wide flat deck barge. Crowley is mobilizing such a barge (the 410) and a crane from Orange, Texas, that could be used for cargo discharge, and plans to have both on the scene in Port-au-Prince on or about Feb. 2.*
