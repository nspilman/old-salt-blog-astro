On Tuesday evening, the 82m general cargo ship, Carrier, was blown ashore in high winds and seas near a quarry jetty at Llanddulas, near Colwyn Bay, Wales. Two lifeboats and an RAF helicopter successfully rescued seven Polish crew members from the stricken ship despite gale conditions. The ship is reported to be intact, but there are increasing concerns over pollution from the 40,000 litres of fuel aboard the ship. Thanks to [David Hayes](http://www.historicnavalfiction.com/) and [Alaric Bond](http://alaricbond.com/) for passing along the news.
