The ship was less than a half a ship-length off the rocks when it was able to anchor. 

The cruise ship [*Viking Sky*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Viking_Sky) is now underway bound for the port of Molde, Norway, accompanied by a tug and support vessels. Prior to getting underway, 479 passengers were evacuated by helicopters, leaving 436 passengers and 458 crew members onboard. There are 20 reported injuries. 

The ship lost power on Saturday and came perilously close to drifting onto the rocky shore in seas described as 8 meters (26 feet) high and winds of 38 knots. Norwegian Coast Guard officer Emil Heggelund told [newspaper VG](https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/1nOlqB/cruiseskipet-viking-sky-med-motorstans-dramatisk-evakuering) that the ship was 100 meters (328 feet) from striking an under the water reef and 900 meters (2,953 feet) from shore when was able to anchor in Hustadvika Bay. For context, as the ship is 228 m (748 ft), it was less than a half a ship-length off the rocks before it was able to anchor. 

The ship’s personnel were subsequently able to get three of the four main engines on-line and move the ship farther from the coastline. Passengers were evacuated by five helicopters throughout the night until towing vessels arrived. After an initial period under tow, the [*Viking Sky* was reported to under its own power](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-24/more-passengers-lifted-off-norway-cruise-ship-before-towing) at a speed of 7 knots.

Viking Cruises chairman Torstein Hagen praised the rescue operation by Norwegian authorities and the actions of the vessel’s crew.  He told Norway’s VG newspaper that the events surrounding the Viking Sky were “some of the worst I have been involved in, but now it looks like it’s going well in the end and that we’ve been lucky.”
