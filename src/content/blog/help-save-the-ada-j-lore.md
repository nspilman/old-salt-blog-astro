![adaclore](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/11/adaclore.jpg)Last year we posted about [a very bad night for the schooner, *Ada C. Lore*.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/12/a-bad-night-for-the-oyster-schooner-ada-c-lore-cousin-to-a-j-meerwald/) In the early morning hours of December 4, 2014, the Eastport, Maine breakwater pier where she was berthed suddenly collapsed onto the *[Ada C. Lore](http://schooneradaclore.com/)*, doing considerable damage to the 1923 built converted oyster dredger.  The good news is that the historic schooner is being restored, which will take approximately 6-8 months. *Ada C. Lore* is a near-sister vessel to the *[A.J. Meerwald](http://bayshorecenter.org/a-j-meerwald/)*, New Jersey’s official Tall Ship.

The restoration will include all or partial replacement of: top timbers, topside planks, covering board, cap rail, rub rail, decking, cabin tops, running and standing rigging, center board trunk, helm and steering gear, quarter bits, electrical wiring and components, plumbing associated with firefighting, re-caulking, and paint. To ensure the highest quality standards, the restoration crew will be working closely with the U.S. Coast Guard through every step of the process.

To help out in the restoration process, go to the [*Ada C. Lore* donation page](http://schooneradaclore.com/donations/). Thanks to Jesse Briggs on Facebook for the heads up.
