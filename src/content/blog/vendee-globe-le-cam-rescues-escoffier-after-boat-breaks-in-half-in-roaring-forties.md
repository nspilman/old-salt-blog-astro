Kevin Escoffier

High drama on the high seas. [Kevin Escoffier](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/89/kevin-escoffier) was in third place in the [Vendee Globe Race](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en), sailing in the “Roaring Forties” about 840 miles south of Cape Town, when his boat *PRB* broke in half. He sent a brief message to his team at 1346hrs (UTC), saying: “I need assistance. I am sinking. This is not a joke.” He had just enough time to activate his EPIRB, don a neoprene survival suit, and to get to his liferaft before the boat sank beneath him.

Rescue services, including the MRCC Cape Town and French CROSS Griz, working with the PRB team and Vendée Globe race organizers, requested [Jean Le Cam](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/116/jean-le-cam), the nearest competitor, in the boat *Yes We Cam!*, to sail to *PRB*’s last known position when the beacon was triggered.

When Le Cam arrived at the position (40°55 S 9°18 E) he initially spotted Escoffier’s life raft but then lost sight of it in the 5-meter seas and 20-25 knot winds. [Yachting World](https://www.yachtingworld.com/news/vendee-globe-rescue-le-cam-escoffier-sinking-atlantic-128743) reports: *While Le Cam began initiating a search pattern, race organizers requested that three more Vendée Globe competitors – [Boris Herrmann](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/109/boris-herrmann), [Yannick Bestaven](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/91/yannick-bestaven), and [Sebastien Simon](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/skippers/90/sebastien-simon) – divert to PRB’s last known position. By this stage, it was dark, with 3-5m waves, and blowing 22-25 knots.*

*The four searching skippers were given a grid search area using drift positions calculated by Météo France, and began sailing the area – no easy task to be short-tacking an IMOCA in heavy seas whilst maintaining a search lookout.*

Finally, Le Cam spotted Escoffier’s light in the water and was able to bring him aboard his boat at 0118 hrs (UTC).

Yachting World also notes a historical parallel: *This amazing rescue is a fairy tale ending to a story that began during the [2008-2009 Vendée Globe](https://www.yachtingworld.com/news/vendee-globe-le-cam-safe-on-prb-16964) when Vincent Riou, the then the skipper of PRB, rescued Jean Le Cam from his upturned IMOCA 60 200 miles west of Cape Horn. Le Cam was trapped inside his upturned VM Materiaux for 16 hours before Riou was able to reach his position, shout to him, and recover him from the capsized yacht, ending his own Vendée Globe challenge in the process.*
