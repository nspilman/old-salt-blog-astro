One unexpected victim of Superstorm Sandy was New York’s [Coney Island Mermaid Parade](http://www.coneyisland.com/programs/mermaid-parade), or more specifically, the historical museum, performance space and gift shop that helped to financially support the free parade.  The parade is  “*an American celebration of ancient mythology and honky-tonk rituals of the seaside, … kicking off the summer with incredible art, an entrepreneurial spirit and unflagging Coney Island pride.”*  The Mermaid Parade attracts close to a million people each year.  See our post about last year’s [30th Mermaid Parade](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/30th-annual-coney-island-mermaid-parade/).  As a result of the devastating storm, the organizers of the 31st Coney Island Mermaid Parade face a budget shortfall of $100,000. All is not yet lost however.  [A Kickstart Fundraiser is underway to raise the money.](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377116752/save-the-coney-island-mermaid-from-extinction)
