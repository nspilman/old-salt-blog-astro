*Have you read Rick Spilman’s novel [Hell Around The Horn](http://oldsaltpress.com/hell-around-the-horn-a-novel-by-rick-spilman/)?*

*It’s a thriller that tells of the captivating story about a young ship’s captain and his family who sets sail on Lady Rebecca – a 1905 windjammer, from Wales bound for Chile, by way of Cape Horn in the Age of Sail. Based on an actual voyage, and written with historical accuracy, Rick draws you into the world of whipping westerly winds, mutiny and survival on the high seas.
