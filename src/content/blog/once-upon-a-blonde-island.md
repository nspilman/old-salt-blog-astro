![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/02/mislands.jpg)Somehow this sounds like a really bad idea.  I just hope everyone brings sun screen.  Back in October, the [BBC ran an article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11442920) about a Lithuanian company’s plans for a Maldive island resort  run entirely by blondes.  The proposed development was reported on again this  week in the Associated Press, [the Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/03/blonde-island-resort-in-m_n_818005.html) and other sources.  The company [Olialia](http://www.olialia.lt/), pronounced “ooh-la-la”, “ *is run and staffed by blonde women, and already operates in 75 different business sectors, making products from computer software and food products to pop music.*”

[Lithuanian blonde island plan raises eyebrows](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11442920)  
  
*A Lithuanian company plans to set up a holiday island in the Maldives run entirely by blondes – the latest project in a growing blonde movement in the Baltics. But how legitimate is this latest sign of Baltic blonde ambition?*

*The island project was officially unveiled this weekend at a party with a blonde dress code, in a new nightclub in Vilnius opened by Olialia. But the resort, which is meant to be opened in 2015, has been heavily criticised.*

*When it was announced on the Maldivian news website “Minivan” in September, many readers condemned it as discriminatory by potentially excluding non-white Maldivians.*

*Local laws could make things difficult as resorts in the Maldives are required to hire at least 50% local staff.*

*Giedre Pukiene says her company does not discriminate and welcomes all applicants, no matter what their gender, age, ethnicity or hair colour.*

*“But we find that when women with dark hair work here, they are surrounded by all these beautiful blondes, so eventually they end up going blonde too,” she said.*
