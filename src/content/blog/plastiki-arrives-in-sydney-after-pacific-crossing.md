*The Plastiki left the US city of San Francisco in March, crossing the Pacific and then travelling via Western Samoa and New Caledonia before arriving in Australia.*

*It sailed via the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/08/02/expedition-sets-sail-to-the-great-plastic-vortex/) – a sea of waste about five times the size of the UK that sits just below the surface between California and Hawaii.*

*The vessel is a catamaran, with the thousands of plastic bottles attached with organic glue to two pontoons.*

*Other parts of the boat such as the sails and the mast are made from recycled materials.*

*Mr de Rothschild said he and his crew had wanted to raise awareness of the damage caused to the ocean by the disposal of plastic waste.*

*“We have this addiction to single-use, throwaway plastic, which is choking up the ecosystem,” he said earlier this week.*

*He said that a UN report warning of the dangers posed by plastic waste to the world’s oceans was the inspiration for his trip.*

*The Plastiki will now go on display in Sydney’s Maritime Museum.*

*It was named after the Kon-Tiki, the raft sailed across the Pacific by Norwegian anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl in 1947.*

*His grandson, Olav, was a member of Plastiki’s crew.*
