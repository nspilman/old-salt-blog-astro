![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/new-york-statue-of-liberty-.jpg)Today is the 125th anniversary of the dedication of the [Statue of Liberty](http://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm).   The colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York harbor was designed by Frédéric Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886 as a gift to America from the people of France.  In addition to the [ceremonies on Liberty Island](http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/dispatches/post/2011/10/statue-of-liberty-turns-125-gets-a-webcam/557783/1) there will be a parade of ships this morning around 10:30 which will will travel down the Hudson River from 42nd St. to the Statue of Liberty where they will sound their horns. (Thanks to [Bowsprite](http://bowsprite.wordpress.com/) for the heads-up.)   Fireworks are scheduled for this evening.

While the statue is typically referred to as the “Statue of Liberty” or “Lady Llberty,” its  given name is “Liberty Enlightening the World.”  The National Parks service suggests that on her 125th anniversary that she should be referred to as “Liberty Enlightening the World Wide Web.”  They have installed an [array of web cams in the statue’s torch](http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/) which will soon be providing a 24/7 view of New York harbor and the New York City skyline.  Click here to see the live [Harbor cam](http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_hd), [Torch cam](http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_torch), [Crown cam](http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_crown), [Lady Liberty cam](http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_str) and an [Interactive Panorama](http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_pano).
