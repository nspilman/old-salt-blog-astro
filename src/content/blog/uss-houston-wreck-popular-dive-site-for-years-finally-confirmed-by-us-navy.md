USS Houston

This week, US Navy divers confirmed the location of the wreck of the [*USS Houston*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Houston_\(CA-30\)) in Banten Bay off the Java Sea.   The heavy cruiser was nicknamed the “The Galloping Ghost of the Java Coast,” and sank along with the Australian light cruiser [HMAS *Perth*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Perth_\(1934\)) in the [Battle of the Sunda Strait](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sunda_Strait) during World War II, on the night of February 28, 1942.

From the various headlines in the media, the wreck confirmation sounds like a new discovery.  The Daily Mail headline reads, “[USS Houston … is finally found in Java sea.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2728423/Sunken-vessel-World-War-II-era-USS-Houston.html) ”  Likewise, NPR reported: “[Wreck Of World War II-Era U.S. Ship Dubbed ‘Galloping Ghost’ Is Found](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/08/19/341598997/a-u-s-naval-ship-sunk-during-world-war-ii-is-identified).”  The BBC has a similar headline — “[US Navy: USS Houston wreck found in Java Sea](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28857195).”   It seems unlikely that the wreck was actually “found” as it never seems to have been lost.

The wreck of the *USS Houston* has been a popular dive site for at least a decade.  The Navy has only now gotten around to officially confirming that the wreck is indeed USS *Houston*, even though [a team of divers commemorated the 60th anniversary of the sinking](http://usshoustondive.com/2002/) by diving on the wreck in 2002.  See the video below.  Since then, [local](http://www.kapalselam.org/dive_site/banten_bay/) and [international dive companies](http://www.songlinecruises.com/boats/Putri-Krakatoa.php) have  offered dives on the wreck.  The recreational diving has apparently taken a toll on the wreck, which is final resting place of as many as 700 US sailors and marines.

As reported by the [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28857195): *US and Indonesian divers discovered evidence that pieces of the hull and unexploded ordnance had been removed. The site is a popular underwater dive spot, and officials are co-ordinating its conservation.*
