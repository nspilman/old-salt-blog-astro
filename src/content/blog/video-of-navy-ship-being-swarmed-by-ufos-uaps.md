![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/uapomaha.jpg)Something very strange took place around the middle of July 2019 off the coast of California, near San Diego. Leaked radar images and video from the [USS *Omaha*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Omaha_\(LCS-12\)) show unidentified objects swarming around the ship, visible on several sensor systems.  In common parlance, they would be referred to as UFOs, unidentified flying objects. The military refers to them as UAPs, unidentified aerial phenomena. 

In the same area and over the same period [five US Navy destroyers and one cruise ship also reported swarms of unidentified objects.](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/39913/multiple-destroyers-were-swarmed-by-mysterious-drones-off-california-over-numerous-nights)

We have [previously posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/11/uss-nimitz-uss-roosevelt-the-giant-tic-tacs-navy-videos-of-unexplained-aerial-phenomena/) about F-18 gun-camera footage taken in 2004 from [planes flying off the carrier USS *Nimitz*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nimitz_UFO_incident) and in footage from 2015 from [planes off the USS *Theodore Roosevelt.*](https://www.history.com/videos/uss-nimitz-tic-tac-ufo-declassified-video?playlist_slug=ufo-fighter-pilots-video-playlist) The videos show unidentified flying objects which have been described as looking something like bright, white giant [Tic Tacs,](https://www.tictac.com/us/en/) approximately 30 to 46 feet long. The objects appeared on radar and were observed visually.  The [Navy has confirmed that the videos are real.](https://www.history.com/news/navy-confirms-ufo-videos-real)

An upcoming government report, expected to be released toward the end of this month, is reported to have found no evidence that aerial phenomena witnessed by Navy pilots in recent years are alien spacecraft, but they still cannot explain the unusual movements that have mystified scientists and the military, according to senior administration officials briefed on the findings of a highly anticipated government report.

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/us/politics/ufos-sighting-alien-spacecraft-pentagon.html) notes that the report determines that a vast majority of more than 120 incidents over the past two decades did not originate from any American military or other advanced U.S. government technology, the officials said. That determination would appear to eliminate the possibility that Navy pilots who reported seeing unexplained aircraft might have encountered programs the government meant to keep secret.

But that is about the only conclusive finding in the classified intelligence report, the officials said. And while a forthcoming unclassified version, expected to be released to Congress by June 25, will present few other firm conclusions, senior officials briefed on the intelligence conceded that the very ambiguity of the findings meant the government could not definitively rule out theories that the phenomena observed by military pilots might be alien spacecraft.
