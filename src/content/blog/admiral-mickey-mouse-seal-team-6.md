![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/05/mickey.jpg)Mickey Mouse now apparently owns SEAL Team 6, or at least the name.  Disney has filed  three trademark applications to to claim the rights to the phrase “SEAL Team 6.”   [SEAL Team 6 is believed to be the Navy commando squad that killed Osama Bin Laden](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/05/02/navy-seals-kill-bin-laden/) in the recent raid on his compound.   How can Disney copyright the term “[SEAL Team 6](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-team-that-killed-bin-laden-seal-team-6-2011-5)?”   “*Officially, the team’s name is classified and not available to the public, technically there is no team 6.*”

That is no longer the case.  It is now a trademark of the Walt Disney Company.

*[FishbowlNY](http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/disney-trademarks-seal-team-6_b35689) uncovered three trademark applications that Disney made in early May to claim the rights to the phrase “SEAL Team 6.”* *The applications cover “entertainment and education services,” “toys, games and playthings” and “clothing, footwear and headwear.”*

*It remains to be seen what products will come of these trademarks, but the bin Laden raid video game and pajama set has to be just around the corner.*
