![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/09/Anemos2.jpg)The sailing cargo ship [*Anemos*](https://www.towt.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20240829-CP-US-New-york.pdf) arrived in New York harbor today, completing her maiden transatlantic voyage, her holds filled with over 1,000 tonnes of French cargo. The 266-foot vessel completed the voyage in 15 days, sailing at an average speed of just under 10 knots.

*Anemos* is the first in a series of eight sailing cargo vessels under construction or on order for [TransOceanic Wind Transport (TOWT.)](https://www.towt.eu/en/our-sailing-cargo-ships/) The small ship took two years to build, drawing on advanced sail technology from ocean racing.  

*Anemos* benefits from French expertise in this demanding field. Multiple French manufacturers and designers contributed to the ship’s design, said French shipbuilder [Piriou](https://www.piriou.com/en/metiers/construction-2/). The hull was built at Piriou’s Romania yard, then transferred to Concarneau, France for outfitting. 

The ship’s cargo includes wine, cognac, champagne, and also jam, swimsuits, and many other manufactured products. Among the brands on board this maiden voyage: Martell Mumm Perrier-Jouët, Château La Coste, Maison Joseph Drouhin, Andros, Chartreuse, and Vilebrequin.

Following cargo discharge in New York, *Anemos* will set sail for Santa Marta in Colombia, to load coffee before returning to its home port in France.

TOWT has more than a decade of experience in sail cargo operations and has chartered 20 different vessels over the years. With its own fleet of eight newbuilds, it hopes to scale up to an industrial level. By 2025, the company plans to save 9,600 tons of CO2 emissions per year and move about 70,000 tonnes of cargo annually.
