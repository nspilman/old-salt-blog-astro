The scientists dropped a free-fall camera baited with mackerel just north of the Samoan Passage in the South Pacific. As the camera sank to the bottom, it was attacked by a [*Taningia danae*](https://www.thecephalopodpage.org/Tdanae.php)—also known as the Dana octopus squid at a depth of around 3,366 feet.

“As we were reviewing the footage, we realized we had captured something very rare,” said Heather Stewart, an adjunct professor at UWA and a member of Kelpie Geosciences, in a statement.

“The squid, which was about \[29½ inches\] long, descended on our camera assuming it was prey, and tried to startle it with its huge bioluminescent headlights. It then proceeded to wrap its arms around one of the other cameras which in turn captured the encounter in even greater detail. I think we were very lucky to have witnessed this.”

[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/deep-sea-rare-squid-caught-camera-1901442) notes that the Dana octopus squid is one of the largest squid species found in the deep ocean, reaching up to 7½ feet. It is found at considerable depths, up to around 4,000 feet below the ocean surface. It feeds on a variety of marine organisms, including fish and smaller squids, and is in turn eaten by such predators as sperm whales.

This species is famed for having two very large photophores on the end of two of its arms, around the size of lemons. They are the largest known photophores in the natural world. These photophores are used to produce bright bioluminescent flashes, designed to disorient prey as well as for communication and attracting mates.

“You can now clearly see the large photophores in the tips of its two arms that produce bioluminescence,” Kolbusz said in the video. “Most importantly, these are the largest known photophores in the natural world, and it’s great to have been able to capture this in two points of view as it interacts with the lander.”
