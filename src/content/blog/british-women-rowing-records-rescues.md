Recently, four British women competing in the [Talisker Whiskey Atlantic Challenge](https://www.taliskerwhiskyatlanticchallenge.com/) [set a new record  as the youngest and fastest all-female crew of four](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35449081) to row across the Atlantic Ocean.  Gee Purdy, 23, Bella Collins, 23, Lauren Morton, 26, and Olivia Bolesworth, 27, in the [“Row Like A Girl”](http://www.rowlikeagirl.uk/) team,” rowed 2,793 nautical miles in 40 days. The previous record, also set in the Talisker race in 2012, was 45 days.  “Row Like A Girl” came in second overall behind [“Ocean Reunion”, a British team of four; Angus Collis, Gus Barton, Joe Barnett, Jack Mayhew](http://antiguaobserver.com/the-first-2016-talisker-row-boat-finishers-arrive/); which also set a new record of 37 days.  Both “Ocean Reunion” and  “Row Like A Girl” broke the previous overall record of 41 days. Ten teams in the Talisker Race are still at sea.

Another [British four woman rowing team attempting to cross the Atlantic has not faired as well](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35572377). The rowers, Gemma Chalk, 33, Clare Lanyon, 45, Jane McIntosh, 36, and Olivia Wilson, 27, set off from Gran Canaria on 26 January, bound for Barbados. They were 400 miles off Cape Verde when they capsized several times in a storm. The boat’s rudder was damaged, as were some of the electronics. Several oars were also lost.  They activated a distress signal and were rescued by a commercial vessel on its way to Canada. The rowing team was affiliated with [Oceanus Rowing](http://www.oceanusrowing.co.uk/female-atlantic-row-2016/) and was not participating in the Talisker Race.
