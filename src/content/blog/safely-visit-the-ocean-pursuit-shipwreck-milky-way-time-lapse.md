On March 1st, the 72′ scallop fishing vessel *Ocean Pursuit* came ashore on Bodie Island, part of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, on North Carolina’s Outer Banks. Since then the boat has been settling into the sand as well as attracting tourists. So many people have been visiting the wreck that the National Seashore has [issued a warning to stay away](https://myfox8.com/news/north-carolina-shipwreck-has-become-a-hazardous-attraction/), as the boat appears to be unstable in the sand.

So, whether you are a resident of the Outer Banks or just stuck at home under lockdown, like me, there is still a way to safely visit the *Ocean Pursuit.*  [Wes Snyder](https://wessnyderphotography.zenfolio.com/p844318303) has shot a wonderful timelapse sequence of the shipwreck beneath the Milky Way. It is beautifully done and you won’t get sand in your shoes.
