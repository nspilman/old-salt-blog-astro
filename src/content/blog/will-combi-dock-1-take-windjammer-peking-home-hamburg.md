In early April, the [Hamburger Abendblatt](http://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article209501023/Combi-Lift.html) newspaper reported that the heavy-lift ship *Combi Dock 1* will carry windjammer *Peking* home to Germany to restored in its original home-port of Hamburg for restoration. Last Friday, Will Van Dorp posted photos on his [*Tugster* blog](https://tugster.wordpress.com/2017/04/21/pekings-ride/) of the arrival of *Combi Dock 1* in New York harbor.  The *Peking*‘s departure may be imminently on the horizon. 

*Peking* was built in 1911 at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg for the German ship owner, F. Laeisz, one of the famous [Flying P Liners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner), which were among the last of the great sailing ships to round Cape Horn carrying cargo. The windjammer was a museum ship at New York’s South Street Seaport fro over 40 years and [left the Seaport last September](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/09/saying-goodbye-peking-windjammer-leaves-south-street-last-time/). In the mean time she has been in Caddell Dry Dock in Staten Island being made ready for the voyage to Hamburg. The German government is reported to have set aside 26 million Euros for the transportation and restoration of the historic ship.
