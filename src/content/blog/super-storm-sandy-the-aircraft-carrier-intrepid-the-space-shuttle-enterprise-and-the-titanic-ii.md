Space Shuttle Enterprise Pavilion on SS Intrepid Before and After Sandy

When [we posted yesterday about the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/11/14/superstorm-sandy-reveals-shipwrecks-and-shuts-down-the-statue-of-liberty/) being closed by superstorm Sandy, Liam Hegarty pointed out in a comment that the [Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum](http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/) is also closed until December due to storm damage.

The museum’s newest exhibit, the [Space Shuttle Enterprise](http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/Shuttle/About-Enterprise.aspx) was damaged by Sandy. It had been housed in a temporary inflatable enclosure on the stern of the aircraft carrier Intrepid.  When the storm struck, [it flooded Pier 86 and knocked out the stand-by generators](http://intrepidmuseum.org/Shuttle/News/Hurricane-Sandy-Update.aspx) causing the enclosure to collapse. Reportedly the Enterprise’s tail was slightly damaged.   The Enterprise has not had an easy time [since it arrived in New York, flying in on the back of its own 747](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/27/space-shuttle-endeavour-arrives-in-new-york/). When in transit by barge from JFK airport to the museum on the Hudson River, [one wing was damaged when it struck a railway bridge](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/05/space-shuttle-enterprise-in-new-york-damaged-in-transit-and-delayed-by-weather/).  Such are the dangers of parking in New York City.

On lesser casualty of the storm was a gala dinner by Australian bllionaire businessman Clive Palmer to unveil his plans for the Titanic II, his new luxury cruise ship which he plans to have built in China’s SinoTrans shipyard. The dinner was have been aboard the Intrepid on December 3rd. It will now be rescheduled to sometime in February.
