![Erebus_image](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Erebus_image.jpg)In September, we posted about the discovery of one of two missing ships from the [Franklin Expedition of 1845](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition).  The two missing ships, HMS *[Erebus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Erebus_\(1826\))* and HMS *[Terror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Terror_\(1813\))* were both originally built as bomb ships. As bomb ships they were built to be extremely strong and as such were especially suitable to be refit as expedition ships for Arctic expeditions.  Because the two ships were of roughly the same size and similar in other respects, the archaeologists from Parks Canada were not initially able to identify which of the two ships had been found.  [They now confirm that the ship wreck](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29457728) located is the HMS [*Erebus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Erebus_\(1826\)).   Sir John Franklin, captain HMS *Erebus* and in overall command of the expedition, had been searching for the fabled Northwest Passage.  HMS *Terror* has still not been discovered.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing on the news.
