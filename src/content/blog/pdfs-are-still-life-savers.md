A [recent Coast Guard report on boating safety](http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/08/03/boating.deaths/) noted:  *“Nearly 75 percent of the 736 people who died in boating accidents in 2009 drowned, and 84 percent of those victims reportedly were not wearing a life jacket,” said Rear Adm. Kevin Cook, the Coast Guard’s director of prevention policy. “The two most important things boaters can do to prevent the loss of life is to wear a life jacket and take a boater education course.”*  
  
Once upon a time we all called our PFDs (Personal Flotation Devices) life savers or life vests.  The idea was that if you wore them, they just might save your life.  Unfortunately in our bureaucratic and litigious society  someone pointed out that life vests didn’t always save lives and calling them life vest or worse life savers might imply a certain liability in those cases where lives were not saved.  So therefore, we now have PFDs.   Of course, everyone still calls them life jackets, even the Coast Guard, who writes the regulations for PFDs.

To an extent these figures demonstrate the naysayers point.  If 84% of drowning victims were not wearing life jackets then 16% were wearing life jackets and drowned anyway.  Nevertheless I will keep wearing my life jacket.

The wearing of life jackets is not just an issue for recreational boaters.  Within the last week, [gCaptain](http://gcaptain.com/) covered the death of a [ships mechanic](http://gcaptain.com/maritime/blog/bsu-releases-mob-report-no-lifejacket-again?16591&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:+Gcaptain+\(gCaptain.com\)&utm_content=Twitter) and a [Chief Engineer](http://gcaptain.com/maritime/blog/drunk-chief-engineer-refused-lifejacket-died?16635&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:+Gcaptain+\(gCaptain.com\)) whose lives probably would have been saved if they were wearing life jackets.

I fear that I am stating the obvious here, yet based on the body count of those who chose not to wear PFDs,  perhaps not.  This week, I am going kayaking with my family on Lake George, a large and beautiful lake in the Adirondack Mountains of New York state. We will be wearing life jackets.  So far this year two paddlers have died. One kayak was hit by a power boat.   The kayaker was seriously injured by the collision but died of drowning.  He was not wearing a life jacket.   In another case a paddler in a canoe drown when he was capsized by power boat wakes.  he wasn’t wearing a life jacket either.

Whatever one calls them, PFDs are still lifesavers.

[While fatalities continue, life jacket use remains low](http://www.threesheetsnorthwest.com/blog/2009/06/while-fatalities-continue-life-jacket-use-remains-low/)
