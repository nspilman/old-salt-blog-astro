![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Tall_Ship.jpg)Great news. The replica Continental sloop [*Providence*](http://tallshipprovidence.com/) will be returning to the water. The sloop was seriously damaged when she was blown over in a blizzard in Newport in January 2015.  For some time the future of the vessel was unclear. Recently, the [sloop had been listed for sale](http://www.yachtworld.com/boats/1976/Classic-Tall-Ship-2546940/Somerset/MA/United-States#.V8WK63YrIet) in her damaged condition on Yachtworld. Now [the Associated Press is reporting](http://www.abc6.com/story/32866442/tall-ship-providence-to-be-repaired) that *Providence* is going to be repaired. The owner, Thorpe Leeson, hopes to have the 61′ sloop in the water in a year.

From [our post of January 27, 2015](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=37845&action=edit): The sloop [*Providence*,](http://tallshipprovidence.com/) a 1976 built replica of the Continental Navy sloop of the same name, was blown off her jack stands while on shore at Newport Shipyard in Newport, Rhode Island on Tuesday in blizzard conditions.  The ship was dis-masted and suffered hull damage when she fell over in winds reported to be gusting up to 60 mph. [Thorpe Leeson, the sloop’s owner](http://patch.com/rhode-island/newport/tall-ship-providence-topples-over-storm-0), told the Associated Press that extra supports were added beneath the ship as a precaution for the storm, but they failed in the high winds.

The *Providence* is a replica of a [Continental Navy sloop built in 1775](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Providence_\(1775\)) and which was commanded by Abraham Whipple, John Paul Jones and John Rathbun, among others.   The *Providence* sank or captured 40 British ships during the war.  The replica [*Providence*](http://tallshipprovidence.com/) is 61′ long on deck and 110′ long overall and has a fiberglass hull.  She has appeared in a variety of roles in several movies including two of the *Pirates of the Caribbean* films.
