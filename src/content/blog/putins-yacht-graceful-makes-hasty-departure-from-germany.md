![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/graceful.jpg)[German media reports](https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/politik/ausland/politik-ausland/aus-angst-vor-festsetzung-hier-fluechtet-die-putin-jacht-aus-hamburg-79076658,view=conversionToLogin.bild.html) that the 83-meter yacht, *Graceful*, believed to be owned by Vladimir Putin, has made a hasty departure from Hamburg, Germany, bound for Russia, before finishing repairs and renovations at the Blohm and Voss shipyard. Some speculate that the move is meant to avoid confiscation or sanctions in the event Russia invades Ukraine and triggers reprisals. *Graceful* was spotted on a [public maritime-traffic-tracking site](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:470288/mmsi:273294110/imo:1011551/vessel:GRACEFUL) sailing for Kaliningrad.

*Graceful* is the largest and most expensive of [four yachts](https://www.superyachtcontent.com/superyacht-news/vladimir-putin-and-his-ott-superyacht-collection/) believed to be owned by Putin. The other yachts are the 57-meter *Olympia*, the 54-meter *Chayka*, and the 35-meter *Petrel.*  Collectively, the yachts are estimated to be valued at approximately $200 million.
