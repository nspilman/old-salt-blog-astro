![sherrydawn](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sherrydawn.jpg)Here on the west bank of the Hudson River, I spent most of the morning digging out from yesterday’s blizzard, which dumped around 30 inches of snow on us. So, it seems like a good time to think of sunshine and warm breezes. The video, after the page break, is of an Albin Nimbus 42, named *Sherry Dawn.* This summer I hope to be sailing a sister vessel named *Arcturus*. Right now *Arcturus,* ex-*Obsession*, is being worked on by the good folks at [Deltaville Yachting Center](http://dycboat.com/), in eastern Virginia on the Chesapeake . In the meantime, I will just admire the lovely *Sherry Dawn*.
