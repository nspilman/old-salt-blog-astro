![prideii](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/prideii.jpg)Tremendous news for a great ship. On Monday, Maryland’s [Governor Hogan announced a $1.5 million private-public partnership](http://governor.maryland.gov/2016/01/18/governor-hogan-announces-new-partnership-with-pride-of-baltimore-ii/) with the replica Baltimore clipper, *[Pride of Baltimore II](http://www.pride2.org/)*.  Under a new agreement, the state will commit the funds to Pride of Baltimore Inc., the nonprofit that owns and operates the *Pride*, over the next three years.

“*Pride of Baltimore is a wonderful symbol of the rich maritime heritage of both our state and the city of Baltimore, and the ship generates extremely valuable exposure and goodwill wherever she goes,*” said Governor Larry Hogan. “*We are pleased to have a new partnership with the Pride and to have her help carry our message across the state, nation, and globe – that Maryland is open for business.*”

*“Pride’s mission has been to promote historical maritime education, foster economic development and tourism, and represent the people of Maryland in ports throughout the world,”* said Rick Scott, executive director of Pride of Baltimore Inc. *“We are thrilled to have a new partnership with Maryland and we will be working closely with the Maryland Departments of Transportation and Commerce to promote economic development here.”*

Launched in 1988, *Pride of Baltimore II* is a topsail schooner that is a replica of the [Baltimore clippers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Clipper) built in the city which became well-known as privateers in the War of 1812.

“*The Pride is a great iconic figure of Maryland and Baltimore*,” said Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn. “*As the Pride travels around our country, it promotes our state and largest city in a positive light*.”
