The [University of Maine Advanced Structures and Composites Center](https://composites.umaine.edu/) recently used its 3D printer to construct the world’s largest 3D-printed boat. In doing so, the university was awarded [three Guinness World Records](https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2019/10/10/umaine-composites-center-receives-three-guinness-world-records-related-to-largest-3d-printer/) for the world’s largest prototype polymer 3D printer, largest solid 3D-printed object, and largest 3D-printed boat. The boat, named 3Dirigo, is 25′ long and weighs 5,000-pounds. 3Dirigo is built of a [50% plastic-wood cellulose blend](https://3dprinting.com/news/university-creates-worlds-largest-3d-printed-boat/) and took 72 hours to print. The U of Maine 3D printer can print objects up 100′ long.

Below are two videos — the first of the 3Dirigo’s unveiling and the second a timelapse video of the boat being printed.
