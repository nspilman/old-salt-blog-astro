![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/admiraltychart.jpg)In 2019, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA ) announced that it was [phasing out the production of traditional paper nautical charts](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/11/noaa-phasing-out-paper-chart-production/) over a [five-year period](https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-begins-transition-exclusively-to-electronic-navigation-charts). NOAA intends to focus on improving the fully electronic navigational charts (ENCs) that they provide.

Now, the UK Hydrographic Office (UKHO) has [announced it will stop producing Admiralty paper charts](https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/admiralty-paper-charts-to-cease-88829) by late 2026 to likewise increase its focus on its digital navigation products and services. Admiralty charts are the most widely used paper charts globally.

[Yachting Monthly](https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/admiralty-paper-charts-to-cease-88829) reports that the UKHO will develop digital alternatives for sectors still using paper charts, in consultation with customers and stakeholders, including the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) as well as other regulatory bodies, hydrographic offices, industry partners, and distributors.

The chief executive of the UKHO Peter Sparkes said there had been a ‘rapid decline in demand for paper charts’, driven by the safety of life at sea (SOLAS)-mandated transition to Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS).

‘The decision to commence the process of withdrawing from paper chart production will allow us to increase our focus on advanced digital services that meet the needs of today’s seafarers. As we look to the future, our core purpose remains the safety of shipping operations and delivering the best possible navigation solutions to achieve that,’ he said.

Following the UKHO’s announcement, chart publisher Imray has stressed that it will continue to print paper charts. Imray is the only private chart publisher to be recognized by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency for its chart range, which is supported by the weekly Notice to Mariners.
