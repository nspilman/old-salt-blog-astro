![Hoegh_Osaka_Bramble_Bank](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Hoegh_Osaka_Bramble_Bank.jpg)The car carrier MV [*Hoegh Osaka*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_H%C3%B6egh_Osaka) ran aground on [Bramble Bank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bramble_Bank) in the [Solent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solent) around 21:30 GMT on Saturday.  The crew of 28 was rescued and there are currently no reports of pollution. The ship was bound for Germany when she went aground.  *Hoegh Osaka* is 590′ (180m) long and can carry 2,520 cars or 450 trucks.  The ship has rolled to approximately 45 degrees. Were this another time, it might appear that the ship had been grounded for [carreening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careening).  Salvage operations are being planned. Video after the page jump.
