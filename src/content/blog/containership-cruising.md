CMA CGM CHRISTOPHE COLOMB

I have seen this item a couple of times and am finally convinced that it is not a spoof.  Apparently [CMA CGM](http://www.cma-cgm.com/), the world’s third largest container shipping group, is offering a “Cargo cruise” onboard their largest containerships.

[Travel Aboard One of the Largest Containerships In the World](http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/travel-aboard-one-largest-containerships-world/)  
  
*CMA CGM Group is now offering genuine cruises aboard the biggest vessels in its fleet, the new 13,800-TEU\* containerships. These giants of the seas (365 m in length, equivalent to 3.5 soccer fields), are among the largest vessels of their kind in the world.*

*The company even offers cruises aboard its flagship, the CMA CGM CHRISTOPHE COLOMB, which has a special private deck and spacious luxury cabins. Passengers also have access to a range of facilities such as a lounge with TV equipment, a library, a fitness room and even a swimming pool in which to relax. Passengers are in daily contact with the crew and take their meals at the Captain’s table.*

The reason I thought this was a joke was because a “cruise” on a containership has to be a very different experience from the old days of freighter sailing. The old cargo liners tended to have accommodations for twelve passengers.  The ships would often take three or four days to load and discharge cargo so there was time for sightseeing while in port and the docks tended to be pretty close to the city so getting around wasn’t an issue.

Containerships, however tend to have relatively fast turn times.  Depending on the port and the quantity of cargo,  it isn’t unusual for a containership to arrive, discharge and load in eight to twelve hours.  Container terminals are often vast parking lots with tractors and fork trucks moving boxes around at breakneck speed.   Getting from the ship to the terminal is itself a challenge not to mention all the security one has to go through on entering or leaving.

I am very fond of containerships.  I worked for US Lines when  Malcolm  McLean  introduced his his “Jumbo Econ ” ships which everyone said were too large.   At 4,400 TEU they now look rather small compared to the CMA CGM behemoths.  Nevertheless a large containership is not what immediately comes to mind  when I think of cruising.  It will be very interesting to see if CMA CGM’s venture is a success.
