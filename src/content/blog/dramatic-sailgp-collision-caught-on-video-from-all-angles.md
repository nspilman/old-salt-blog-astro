Last week, just before the start of the third race in the [SailGP Australian Sail Grand Prix](https://www.sail-world.com/news/244891/Great-Britain-SailGP-Team-out-of-contention) in Sydney, [Ben Ainslie’s Great Britain Team](https://sailgp.com/teams/great-britain/) collided with [Nathan Outteridge’s Japan Team](https://sailgp.com/teams/japan/). The crew onboard the British F50 were focussing on closing the gap to the American boat in the pre-start and they did not see the Japanese boat. That error resulted in a significant crash with both boats unable to continue racing. Thankfully, no one was hurt. 

The video compilation below shows the collision, which sheared off the Japanese boat’s starboard bow, from all angles.
