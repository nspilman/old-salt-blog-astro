This Saturday, the [South Street Seaport Museum](http://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/) celebrated its Spring Revival with the grand re-opening of Pier 16 and the [Street of Ships](http://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/visit/street-of-ships/). The ceremony began with the ringing of the bell on the historic lightship [*Ambrose*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightship_Ambrose) built in 1907. The bell that once guided fog-bound ships safely into New York harbor, will, perhaps, also mark the return of the South Street Seaport Museum.

Captain Jonathan Boulware, interim president of the museum, along with the Manhattan Borough President, Gale Brewer; and District 1 – Council Member, Margaret Chin; and several others, spoke of the importance of the South Street Seaport to New York City and the nation; that the seaport was the “front door to America.”  Boulware  thanked all the museum supporters and the dedicated army of volunteers that have kept the museum running during recent difficult times.  Boulware also announced that the museum will begin a $5.2 million dollar restoration of the square rigged ship *Wavertree.* 

After the short speeches, the historic lightship *[Ambrose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightship_Ambrose),* the [schooner *Pioneer*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_\(schooner\)) , and the “Flying P” windjammer, [*Peking*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_\(ship\)) were open to the public.  The [schooner *Lettie G. Howard*,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettie_G._Howard) newly returned from the shipyard in Mystic Seaport after the museum raised $250,000 for repairs, was tied up alongside the *Ambrose*.

The one large vessel that was not open to the public was the 1885 built iron full rigged ship [*Wavertree*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavertree_\(ship\)).  The planned $5.2 million restoration of the *Wavertree* is planned to begin towards the end of this year with a target completion in 2015.  *Wavertree* is currently the largest iron sailing vessel afloat.

In addition to the ships there were also demonstrations of ships’ carving and print making as well as sea song sung by the group “New York Packet.”   One of the singers in group is Frank Woerner.  Almost forty years ago when I first came to New York I used come down to Pier 16, long before the built the mall, and listen to Bernie Clay and the X-Seaman’s Institute sing sea shanties on the pier.  Frank Woerner was one of the X-Seaman. (Strangely enough, I don’t think that Frank has grown that much older.)

Under prior management, the South Street Seaport Museum was [shut down in February 2012](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-south-street-seaport-museum/) due to financial crisis. With a new management team, led by the Museum of the City of New York, and new funding grants, the museum was getting back on its feet when it was struck a body blow by the storm surge from Superstorm Sandy in late 2012.  The ships rode out the storm but the building ashore suffered $20 million dollars worth of damage.  In June of last year, the [Museum of the City of New York pulled out](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/06/horrible-news-for-new-yorks-south-street-seaport-museum/). Recently there have been suggestions that real estate development would force the museum out. Nevertheless, the South Street Seaport museum has carried on, regardless.
