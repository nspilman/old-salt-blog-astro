![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shiplorebanner1.jpg)If you are in Manhattan next Monday night, April 24, feel free to stop by the meeting of the New York Ship Lore and Model Club. Stephen Hopkins and I will be giving a joint presentation on three remarkable ships. I will discuss two amazing yet radically different ships which set off on their maiden voyages in 1845 — the extreme clipper *Rainbow* and the luxury steamer SS *Great Britain.*  Following my comments, Stephen Hopkins, author of “*[Red Jacket — the Life and Times of a Maine Clipper Ship](http://maineauthorspublishing.com/red-jacket/),*” will speak about his new book and answer questions about the ship that was one of the largest and finest of all clippers.

The Monday meeting is at 7:30PM at 79 Walker Street, 5th floor. Admission is free.
