I have recently discovered that mermaids are indeed real, well, after a fashion, though not in the sense suggested by [cheesy fake documentaries shown on the Discovery Channel](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/06/fake-mermaids-and-pathetic-pirate-ships-dumbing-down-ocean-science-and-history/).   There is a small cadre of women who perform as mermaids and models professionally.  It is certainly one of the more unusual jobs, though no doubt providing steadier work than [scuba-diving Santas](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/scuba-diving-santa-swimming-with-sharks-a-new-holiday-tradition/), which does tend to be highly seasonal.

The existence of professional mermaids is not actually a surprise to me.  It is more of a fond and distant memory.  I went to high school in Florida near Tampa Bay.  About an hour north of Tampa are a series of deep fresh water springs which have carved limestone caverns.  In one of these springs, [Weeki Wachee](http://www.weekiwachee.com/), [mermaids have been performing for tourists](http://www.weekiwachee.com/index.php/about-us/history-of-weeki-wachee-springs) since 1946.  As mermaids are not indigenous to Florida (or anywhere else, in point of fact) the Weeki Wachee mermaids are women in mermaid costumes swimming with partially concealed air hoses.  I remember watching the mermaids perform underwater when I was in high school.  [Weeki Wachee boasts a current roster](http://www.weekiwachee.com/index.php/mermaids/mermaid-roster) of twelve professional mermaids and two mermen.  Oddly, because Weeki Wachee was taken over by the State of Florida is is now a State Park, the [mermaids and mermen are technically state employees.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/08/weeki-wachee-mermaids-florida_n_4393965.html)

Being a professional mermaid isn’t easy.  A few years ago, Business Week had an article about the challenges of being a professional mermaid at Weeki Wachee — [Odd Jobs: Professional Mermaid](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-03/odd-jobs-professional-mermaid).  Cold water, strong currents and low pay seem to come with the job.  On the other hand, Weekie Wachee’s senior mermaid, Staycy McConnell, who was featured in the article is still performing after close to fifteen years in the water.

What I had not realized until recently is that there is a sizable pod of professional mermaids outside of the springs at Weeki Wachee.   They include [Mermaid Melissa](http://www.mermaidmelissa.com/), [Hannah Mermaid](http://www.hannahfraser.com/mermaid/), [Linden Wolbert (Mermaid to the Stars)](http://www.mermaidsinmotion.com/), [Lanai the  New York mermaid](http://www.newyorkmermaid.com/), [Mermaid Sasha](https://www.facebook.com/MermaidSashaNY/info), [Mermaid Iona](https://twitter.com/MermaidIona), [Dana Marie, Mermaid of the Sea](http://iamamermaid.com/2011/03/18/dana-marie-mermaid-of-the-sea/), and  [Katrin Felton “Mermaid Kat.”](https://www.youtube.com/user/Katrinfelton/featured)  Also, [Blue Mermaid Designs](http://www.bluemermaid.net/) describes itself as a pod of professional mermaids, providing mermaid entertainment for a variety of events.  This is by no means an inclusive list.  Not doubt I have omitted many of the finned clan.

It turns out that mermaid fun need not be limited to the professionals.  The [Philippine Mermaid Swimming Academy](http://www.philippinemermaidswimmingacademy.com/) in Manila offers courses in “mermaiding.”  And for a more free-form mermaiding, there is always the yearly [Coney Island Mermaid Parade.](http://metro.co.uk/2014/06/23/mermaids-and-mermen-at-the-coney-island-mermaid-parade-2014-4772659/)
