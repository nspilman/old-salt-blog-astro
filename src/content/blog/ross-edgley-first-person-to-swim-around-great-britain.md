![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/11/rossroundbritainswim-1.jpg)Adventurer Ross Edgley, 33, has become the [first person to swim the 1,780-miles](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46088884) around Great Britain. Setting out from Kent on June 1st, Edgley swam up to 12 hours per day, sleeping at night on his support boat. He did not set foot on land for 155 days. 

Back on dry land, Edgley, 33, told the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46088884) that despite needing to learn to walk again after so long in the water he is still “not quite bored of swimming” and looking for his next challenge. 

In his epic swim, he battled cold water, strong tides and currents, braved storms, jellyfish, and late autumn weather. The effort took its toll on his body, resulting in shoulder pain, wetsuit chafing and the partial disintegration of his tongue from salt water exposure.

Edgley was joined by 300 swimmers for the last mile before he arrived in Margate.
