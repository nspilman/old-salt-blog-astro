![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/01/preussenfullsail.jpg)My wife and I are currently sailing as passengers on the cruise ship [*Royal Clipper*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Clipper), the second of only two five-masted full-rigged steel ships ever built. The first such ship was the mighty windjammer, [*Preussen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preussen_\(ship\)), of 1902. The *Royal Clipper,* launched in 2000, was inspired by the *Preussen.* An updated repost.

Here is an animation from a [Mariner’s Mirror podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@marinersmirrorpodcast) about the *[Preussen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preussen_\(ship\)),* perhaps the greatest windjammer of the early twentieth century. One of the [Flying P-Liners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner), built for the F. Laeisz shipping company in 1902, she was then the only five-masted full-rigged steel commercial sailing ship ever built. 

The animation is designed to accompany [an episode of the Mariner’s Mirror Podcast in which Dr Sam Willis speaks with Frank Scott](https://shows.acast.com/the-mariners-mirror-podcast/episodes/iconic-ships-19-preussen), a retired naval aviator and qualified square rig ship-master, who commanded various square riggers ranging from 80 to 800 gross tonnes. In his long sail training career he served in fourteen square riggers, under seven different national flags.
