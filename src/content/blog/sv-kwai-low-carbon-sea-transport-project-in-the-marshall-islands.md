The sailing cargo ship [SV *Kwai*](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/06/sv-kwai-cargo-and-passenger-service-under-sail-in-the-south-pacific/) has been owned by the [Republic of the Marshall Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Islands) (RMI) since January 2021, as one element of the island archipelago’s goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This multi-faceted RMI effort is being supported by the [Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit](https://www.bonn.de/microsite/en/international-profile/international-location/deutschegesellschaftfuerinternationalezusammenarbeitgmbh-giz-.php#:~:text=Zusammenarbeit%20GmbH%20\(GIZ\)-,Deutsche%20Gesellschaft%20f%C3%BCr%20Internationale%20Zusammenarbeit%20GmbH%20\(GIZ\),education%20work%20around%20the%20globe.) (the German international development agency known as GIZ) as well as the German Ministry of the Environment. The Marshall Islands Shipping Corporation chartered SV *Kwai* for four months between September and December 2020 to test its capacity and seaworthiness in island waters.

The SV *Kwai* is 43 meters (140 ft), with a beam of 7 meters (23 ft), draws 3 meters (10 ft), has a tonnage of 179 RT and is ketch rigged. While equipped with a main engine and generator, the goal is to operate under sail 90% of the time.

Here is a short video about SV *Kwai* and the RMI 2050 Climate Strategy.
