![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/10/romanportwales.jpg)I was surprised to read that archaeologists had recently discovered only the second Roman port in Britain.  Prior to the discovery in excavations near the Roman fortress of Caerleon, just north of Newport, south Wales, the only other Roman port known to have existed was outside of London.

*“It is extremely exciting,” Peter Guest, leading the excavation team from Cardiff University, said. “What we have found exceeds all expectations. It now seems clear that we’re looking at a new addition to our knowledge of Roman Britain.”*

Guest said the archaeologists had discovered far more than a quayside or harbour installation, adding: “It seems to be a deliberately founded and made port structure that goes with the legionary fortress in Caerleon.”

The remains are incredibly well-preserved, partly because the land has been used for grazing for so long and has not been intensively ploughed.

Archaeologists digging on the banks of the River Usk have found the main quay wall as well as landing stages, wharves and dockside tracks.
