![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/weaponscache-200x150.jpg)Disturbing news. An active-duty US Coast Guard lieutenant has been accused of plotting attacks “to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country” [according to court documents](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wl1WR4NJ95llQmNo7bmfVg6pvrq-cgzX/view) filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland on Tuesday.  

Christopher Paul Hasson, 49, a self-avowed white nationalist, was arrested after federal investigators uncovered a cache of weapons, ammunition, and illegal drugs in his Maryland home. The court documents, however, say that “the …charges, however, are the proverbial tip of the iceberg. The defendant is a domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect governmental conduct.”

Hasson called for “focused violence” to “establish a white homeland” and dreamed of ways to “kill almost every last person on earth.” He compiled a spreadsheet [hit list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Paul_Hasson#2019_arrest) of prominent Democratic politicians including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/20/696470366/arrested-coast-guard-officer-planned-mass-terrorist-attack-on-a-scale-rarely-see) reports, “In addition to Pelosi, Hasson was allegedly considering some type of violent assault on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Richard Blumenthal, along with U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Maxine Waters and former House member, Beto O’Rourke. The spreadsheet list also included MSNBC hosts Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough, as well as Don Lemon and Van Jones from CNN.”  

Hasson has been working at the U.S. Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, D.C., since 2016. He was an active duty member at the time he was arrested. Prior to that, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1988 to 1993 after which he joined the Army National Guard for about two years.

“The illegal weapons and drug charges \[were\] a result of an ongoing investigation led by the Coast Guard Investigative Service, in cooperation with the FBI and Department of Justice,” Coast Guard spokesman Barry Lane told NPR in an emailed statement.
