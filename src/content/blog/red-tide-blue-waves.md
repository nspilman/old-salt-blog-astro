Recently, an outbreak of red tide off Newport Beach, California discolored the Pacific waters during daylight and then, once the sun had set, put on an [amazing show of bioluminescence](https://www.ocregister.com/2020/04/16/rare-neon-blue-waves-called-bioluminescence-captured-on-camera-in-newport-beach/) which turned the ocean waves a vivid neon blue. Not all red tide is bioluminescent, but when the conditions are right the phytoplankton bloom which makes up the tides can explode into a blue light when stirred by the action of the waves. A [trio of photographers](https://www.orangecountyoutdoors.com/) captured the most recent display. To see more check out their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_ELxMtp6iS/).

Red tides and blue waves have been occurring from time to time on the California coast for a number of years. Here is a video from San Diego in 2014.
