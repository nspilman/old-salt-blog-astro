Five years ago, a three month old dolphin’s tale became caught in a blue crab trap off the coast of Florida. The blood supply to her tail was cut off by the trap rope. The dolphin, which was given the name [Winter](http://www.seewinter.com/winter/winters-story), was rescued and transported to the [Clearwater Marine Aquarium](http://www.seewinter.com/). Winter recovered, but subsequently lost her tail. She was, however, fitted with a series of prosthetic tales. Winter has become the most popular dolphin at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium and has now had a movie inspired by her story, called fittingly enough, [Dolphin Tale](http://www.seewinter.com/winter/winters-story). The movie stars Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Harry Connick Jr. and Winter, who plays herself. [Dolphin Tale](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1564349/) will be in theaters in late September.
