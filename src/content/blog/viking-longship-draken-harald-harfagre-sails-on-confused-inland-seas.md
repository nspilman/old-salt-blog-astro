The [Pepsi Tall Ships Chicago 2016](https://navypier.com/tall-ships-chicago-2016/) festival begins tomorrow, July 27th, and runs for five days through the 31st, at Chicago’s [Navy Pier](https://navypier.com/) on Lake Michigan. One of the [participating ships](https://navypier.com/tall-ships-chicago-2016/tickets-and-ship-info/#ships) was [expected to be the replica Viking longship](http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160719/news/160718968/) [Draken Harald Hårfagre](http://www.drakenexpeditionamerica.com/).

Earlier this month we posted that the replica [Viking longship *Draken Harald Hårfagre* may be forced from the Tall Ships Challenge 2016 by pilotage fees](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/07/draken-harald-harfagre-may-forced-tall-ships-challenge-fees/). After successfully crossing the Atlantic to participate in [Tall Ships America](http://www.sailtraining.org/)‘s [Tall Ship Challenge 2016](http://www.sailtraining.org/tallships/2016greatlakes/TSC2016index.php), the cost of pilotage in the Great Lakes threatened to turn the ship back.  The Draken Expedition has believed that as a non-profit sail training ship, they would exempt from the pilotage requirments. While that may be true in Canadian waters, in the US portion of the Great Lakes, the ship is required to carry a pilot aboard. The cost of pilotage could reach as high as $400,000, a sum well beyond the means of the Draken Expedition.  So far, the Draken Expedition has raised enough money to travel to the recent tall ship’s festival in [Bay City, MI](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/07/update-draken-harald-harfagre-sails-tall-ships-celebration-bay-city/) and [potentially to the Chicago festival](http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/sailors-battle-costs-regulations-to-bring-viking-ship-to-chicago/). Whether the expedition will be able to continue her planned tour of the Great Lakes is uncertain.  The Sons of Norway have raised over $70,000 thus far to keep the ship sailing.

How did this happen? The problem seems to have been due in large part to confusion over rules and a breakdown in communications.  In Canadian waters, foreign vessels under 35-meters and 1,500 gross tons may not be required to carry a pilot aboard. In US Great Lakes waters, however, any non-recreational foreign flag vessel is required to carry a pilot, which can cost, on average, $400 an hour.  Certain US and Canadian shipping rules and regulations are reciprocal, although this is not the case in pilotage. Apparently, the Draken Expedition assumed that the Canadian pilotage rules would also apply to US waters.  Because the ship is participating in festivals were fees are charged to go aboard, the Coast Guard ruled that the Viking longship is a commercial rather than a recreational vessel. The [regulations were established by the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2009-title46/html/USCODE-2009-title46-subtitleII-partF-chap93.htm) and would require an act of Congress to change.

To learn more about the pilotage regulations, Michigan Live has a interview with Lorne Thomas, a retired Coast Guard captain who now works as chief of external affairs for the U.S. Coast Guard 9th District in Cleveland.
