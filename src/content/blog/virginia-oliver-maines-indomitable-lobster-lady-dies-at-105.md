Virginia ” Ginny” Oliver has hauled her last lobster pot. Widely known as  Maine’s “Lobster Lady,” she died quietly at age 105. Oliver began lobstering at age 8 alongside her father and older brother and spent over a century hauling traps on Penobscott Bay.

“Ginny” gained national and international attention for continuing to lobster well past her 100th birthday, becoming a symbol of longevity, resilience, and Maine’s working waterfront.

“Sad news from the Midcoast,” the Maine Lobstermen’s Association said in a social media post. “Ginny was an amazing ambassador for our industry and exemplified the incredible work ethic that defines our industry and all Mainers! Our thoughts are with her family.”

She kept on lobstering with her son, Max Oliver, on the lobster boat *Virginia,* named after her, out of Rockland, Maine, three days a week, May through November. She was often described as a “Maine treasure.”

She said she didn’t go out if she didn’t want to, but liked the independence that life on the water afforded her and her family.

Born on Clarendon Street in Rockland at her parents’ home in June 1920, the centenarian still lived on the same street but in a different house, where she raised her four children.

All four of her children lobstered, as did her husband.

When she turned 104 last year, she was still actively lobstering and had renewed her fishing license, with plans to continue fishing.
