When thinking of sailing speed records, the first vessels that come to mind are Alain Thébault’s hydrofoil trimaran, [l’Hydroptere](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/03/20/hydroptere-%E2%80%93-fastest-on-the-water-sets-sights-offshore/) or the aptly named [VESTAS Sailrocket 2](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/11/20/vestas-sailrocket-shatters-500m-speed-sailing-record-averaging-59-23-knots/). Both are highly engineered high tech craft which have been under developement for years. I tend to forget kite sailors, even though, [Robert Douglas held the 500M world record for two years,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_sailing_record) for sailing his kite surfer at 55.65 knots.  Now that the Sailrocket appears to have captured  the record, the kite sailors are back to try to regain it.
