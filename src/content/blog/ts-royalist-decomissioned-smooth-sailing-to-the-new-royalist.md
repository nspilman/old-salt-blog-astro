![royalist](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/royalist.jpg)The [TS *Royalist*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TS_Royalist) has [sailed into Portsmouth for the final time](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-30116332). The 43 year old sail training ship owned by the [UK Marine Society & Sea Cadets](http://www.ms-sc.org/) is being decommissioned. Since her delivery in 1971, TS *Royalist* has taken 30,000 cadets to sea. Hundreds of sea cadets gathered at Petrol Pier in Gosport to say farewell to the old ship.

A new training ship, a 32-metre (105ft) brig also named *Royalist*, is under construction at the Spanish shipyard [Astilleros Gondan S.A](http://www.gondan.com/). and is expected to be delivered in March. The new ship is reported to offer greater use of space, with better all-round sailing ability and performance. Faster and easier to handle, the new *Royalist* is also expected to be more economical to run. Following the example of her namesake, the new *Royalist* is expected to be taking cadets to sea for the next 40 years. So, farewell to the *Royalist* and may the new *Royalist* have smooth sailing for decades to come*.*
