They have identified the wreckage of one of the most technologically advanced German submarines of World War II, the *[U-3523](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-3523).*  The submarine was found with its bow buried in the mud and its stern rising from the seafloor in 123 meters of water, ten nautical miles north of Skagen.

The *U-3523* was a [Type XXI submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_XXI_submarine) and was the most advanced submarine of its time, capable of operating underwater almost indefinitely, relying on large battery banks which could be recharged by snorkel.  The hulls were streamlined and more hydrodynamically efficient than other submarines of the period. They could also use hydrogen peroxide as a fuel and were capable of operating at up to 17 knots submerged for short periods.

Between 1943 and 1945, 118 Type XXI submarines were under construction by German shipyards, but only four were finished and only two ever put to sea. The *U-3523*  was sunk by a British B24 Liberator bomber on May 6, 1945, the day after Allied forces liberated Denmark from Nazi occupation.

Captured Type XXI submarines greatly influenced post-war submarine design. The only surviving Type XXI is on display at the [German Maritime Museum at Bremerhaven](https://www.bremerhaven.de/de/tourismus/museen-erlebniswelten/deutsches-schiffahrtsmuseum.16217.html), the base for a large part of the German submarine fleet during the Second World War.
