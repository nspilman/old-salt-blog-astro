[Sandy Hook pilots](https://www.sandyhookpilots.com/) have been guiding ships into New York harbor since 1694 when Colonial legislators first mandated that pilots be stationed at the barrier beach at the mouth of the great harbor. Here are two short videos of New York harbor pilots. The first was shot by Edison Manufacturing Co. near Robbins Reef in 1899.  The second, by Jessica Leibowitz for Gothamist, shows today’s pilots at work.
