Seaport founder and first president, Peter Stanford, speaks to the rally

I was out of town so I could not attend the [Save our Ships Rally](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/05/19/rally-to-save-the-south-street-seaport-this-sunday-may-22-pier-16/) at the South Street Seaport yesterday.  Fortunately foo those of us who couldn’t make it,  there are some great photos at [Will van Dorp’s Tugster blog](http://tugster.wordpress.com/2011/05/22/not-may-day-yet/), the [Save our Ships blog](http://saveourseaport.wordpress.com/2011/05/22/photos-from-todays-save-our-seaport-rally/), and [Paul la Rossa’s blog](http://www.paullarosa.com/blog/2011/05/south-street-seaport-museum-rally/).

The [South Street Seaport Museum](http://www.seany.org/) has long been supported by an active and enthusiastic group of volunteers.   Let us hope that in the future that the museum’s management will meet the same standards of commitment and dedication shown by these volunteers.
