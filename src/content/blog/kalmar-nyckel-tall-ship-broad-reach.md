Here is a short video about the [*Kalmar Nyckel*,](http://www.kalmarnyckel.org/) a replica of Dutch built pinnace purchased by Sweden in the mid-1600s. What makes the *Kalmar Nyckel* so fascinating for me is that while there are a goodly number of 18th century replicas sailing today, actively sailing 17th century replicas are rare.

If you are interested in rigging, the *Kalmar Nyckel* is a particular treat.  From her sprit-topsail that appears to balance precariously on the bow sprit, to the bonnets tied to the bottom of the sails, instead of reef points, there is much that would seem very strange even to an 18th or 19th century sailor. In addition to bunts and clewlines, the tall topsail and course are also furled by martinets, an intricate web of lines led to the long leeches. Add in the lateen mizzen and the whipstaff steering and the *Kalmar Nyckel* is an intriguing sailing vessel which is both familiar and an exotic relic of the past.
