![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/lobsterbin.jpg)After several near boom years, the Maine lobster fishery is being slammed by the current trade war between the United States and China. From June 2018 to June 2019, after the duties were in place, l[ive lobster exports to China tumbled 84 percent.](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/supply-trade/maine-s-lobster-exports-to-china-plunge-84-percent-in-wake-of-trade-war) In the same period Canada’s lobster sales to China reached record highs. Lobster represents the largest export for the state of Maine by value.

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/01/china-loves-maine-lobster-trumps-trade-war-means-canada-is-filling-demand/?arc404=true) reports that in the first half of 2018, before the tariffs, lobster sales to China from the United States and Canada were about even, roughly $84 million, according to data from the Lobster Council of Canada.

ut in the second half of the year, post-tariffs, Canada’s sales to China rose to $141 million, and the United States’ dropped to about $60 million. By June 2019, Canada was at $201 million and U.S. sales were nearly halved, to $33 million.

“We’ve just seen our business with China grow exponentially,” Irvine said. “Without the tariffs, it would have been business as usual.”

Though the United States and China in October reached a [“phase one” deal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/11/us-stocks-poised-big-bounce-expectations-grow-us-china-trade-deal/) to try to de-escalate the 18-month trade war, the agreement won’t affect the lobster tariffs. The bigger question is whether Canada will be able to hold on to its newfound dominance once the trade war ends.
