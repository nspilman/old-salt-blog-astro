*The 2ft high printed sheet is one of only two originals left out of thousands joyously erected in 1805 up and down the country to spread news of the Admiral’s triumph.*

*The poster — found in a Scottish house clearance — boldly proclaims: “The Most Decisive and Glorious Naval Victory that ever was obtained since the creation of the world!!”*

*The poster lists all the ships that took part and the naval captains on both sides — and makes clear that the French and Spanish fleet had 474 more guns and 8,153 more men.*

*Although thousands of the posters would have been made the vast majority it would seem were ripped down or binned and it is thought there are only two left in existence.*

*Tragically Britain’s greatest naval captain Lord Nelson was shot by a marksmen as he paced the deck of his flagship HMS Victory but lived long enough to know the battle was won.*

*There is a depiction of Britannia at the top of the sheet which adds: “The Victorious British fleet was commanded by the most renowned, most gallant, and ever-to-be-lamented hero Admiral Lord Viscount NELSON.”*

*It records: “This memorable action was fought off Cape Trafalgar, near the entrance of the Streights of Gibraltar, on 21st of October 1805.”*
