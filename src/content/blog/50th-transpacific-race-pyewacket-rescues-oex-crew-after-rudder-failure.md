OEX in better days

At around 2AM on Monday, *OEX*, a Santa Cruz 70, owned by John Sangmeister, suffered a catastrophic rudder failure while sailing in the 50th Transpacific Yacht Race. [Sangmeister reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/roy-disney-rescues-competitor-from-sinking-yacht-in-transpac/2019/07/15/6731c444-a762-11e9-8733-48c87235f396_story.html?utm_term=.ad3e85a0dcda) that the lower rudder bearing had blown off and the rudder was “can-opening” the bottom of the boat. 

*OEX* began to sink about 200 miles off the coast. Fortunately, *Pyewacket* , an Andrews 70, was within two-miles of *OEX* and heard the distress call. *Pyewacket* sailed to the sinking yacht and picked up the 9 person crew from liferafts as *OEX* slipped beneath the Pacific. No injuries were reported. *Pyewacket*, owned by Roy Disney, abandoned the race and sailed back to San Diego, arriving early Tuesday. 

Sangmeister said he and his crew were “extremely grateful for the crew of *Pyewacket* for their superb seamanship, gracious welcome, and extra kindness at a moment in need.”

[The Grunion Gazette](http://www.gazettes.com/entertainment/transpac-update-rudder-failure-sinks-oex-pyewacket-to-the-rescue/article_441f2008-a719-11e9-b2a4-a3f454a3ada7.html) commented that this may be the 50th running of the Transpacific Yacht race, but if the first couple of days are any indicator, this may become known as “The Year of the Rudder.”  Of the six boats that have retired from this year’s historic race with 90 entries prior to this incident, four have cited some form of rudder or steering issues.
