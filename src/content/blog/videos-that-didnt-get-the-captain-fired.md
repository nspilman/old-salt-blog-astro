Despite the implication that nobody in the Navy brass has a sense of humor, there are lots of of fun videos floating around the ‘net made on US Navy ships that suggest otherwise.    My personal favorites all tend to be lip-sincing to popular songs.   Here are a few that didn’t get the captain fired.  Click on the link or the thumbnail to see the videos.

Terry Kraft.  The Navy initially pulled the video  “for a ‘lack of propriety’ in a few scenes involving the use of safety equipment.”    Captain Kraft’s career was not harmed by the video. He  is now a rear admiral in command, coincidentally enough, of the *Enterprise* Carrier Strike Group.

Don’t click the link if you are bothered by the meaningless repetition of  foul language.

And honorable mention goes to:
