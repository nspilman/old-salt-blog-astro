### PUBLIC NOTICE :

### FERRYBOAT BINGHAMTON REMOVAL FOR PRESERVATION AND RESTORATION  
BOROUGH OF EDGEWATER, NEW JERSEY

The NOEL LOVE GROSS, TRUSTEE OF TRUST B UNDER ARTICLE IIIB OF THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF NELSON G. GROSS seeking interested qualified parties to enter into an agreement to remove the ferryboat Binghamton from its current site, in Edgewater New Jersey, for the purpose of preservation and restoration.

The ferryboat Binghamton is a National Register structure which was constructed from 1904-1905. This ferryboat was one of six steam-powered screw-propeller, double-ended ferryboats built by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock for the Hoboken Ferryboat Company. The ferryboat served from 1905-1967 between Hoboken and Manhattan before being sold and turned into a restaurant in 1975, known as Binghamton’s. The ferryboat Binghamton was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. She is the last extant steam-powered double-ended double-screw Hudson River ferry. The ferryboat was damaged in Superstorm Sandy in October of 2012 and remains moored in the Borough of Edgewater, New Jersey. NOEL LOVE GROSS, TRUSTEE OF TRUST B UNDER ARTICLE IIIB OF THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF NELSON G. GROSS has plans to redevelop the site after the removal of the vessel.

While the ferryboat is a National Register site, the condition of the vessel is poor. After the ferryboat was moved to her present location in 1975, the 500-ton steam boilers were removed and 640 tons of concrete were poured into the hull as ballast. A major engineering effort will be required for the removal and preservation of the ferryboat. Only qualified interested parties which can demonstrate the ability to undertake the removal and preservation will be considered.

This Public Notice will expire after 90 days, on June 29th, 2016. Interested parties must by that date enter into a written agreement for the removal of the vessel from the site for the purposes of preservation. Specific logistics and timeline for removal are to be determined at a later date through consultation between the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office and NOEL LOVE GROSS, TRUSTEE OF TRUST B UNDER ARTICLE IIIB OF THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF NELSON G. GROSS.

Interested parties should email [FerryboatBinghamton@gmail.com](mailto:FerryboatBinghamton@gmail.com) for more information.
