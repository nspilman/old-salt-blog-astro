This weekend four tall ships participated in the [Tall Ships Festival](https://www.boothbayharborwindjammerdays.org/tall-ships-festival) that this year is a part of the [Boothbay Harbor Windjammer Days](https://www.boothbayharborwindjammerdays.org/) which continues through July 2.  Two of the tall ships, the privateer schooner [*Lynx*](https://tallshiplynx.com/) and the schooner [*Spirit of Bermuda*](https://bermudasloop.org/) are commanded by captains named Peacock. The two captains happen to be father and son. [Don Peacock](https://www.thenantuckethotel.com/island-spotlight-don-peacock-of-lynx-privateer-ship/) is captain of the *Lynx,* while [Captain Alex Peacock](https://abarqueabrigandaschooner.buzzsprout.com/994438/5908153) is at the helm of the *Spirit of Bermuda.* Alex represents the fifth generation of traditional ship sailors in the family. The two schooners and their father and son captains sailed in company from Nantucket to join in the festival. 

Here is a short video about the father and son and the schooners they sail.
