Last week, [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/19/mv-alaed-russian-ship-carrying-arms-for-syria-makes-a-u-turn-heads-back-to-russia/) about the [*MV Alaed*](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9352852/Russian-arms-ship-to-make-second-attempt-to-deliver-helicopters-to-Syria.html), a 9,000 DWT geared cargo ship, reported to be carrying refurbished Russian attack helicopters bound for Syria. The ship, sailing under the Curacao flag, was turned aback after the cancellation of its P&I insurance coverage. The *MV Alaed* has been reflagged under the Russian flag and is reported to be ready to set sail from Murmansk to Syria in a few days. The ship will sail with another vessel as escort. Moscow is one of Syria’s main arms suppliers. There is no UN arms embargo on Syria.
