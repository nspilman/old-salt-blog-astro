Earlier this week [we posted about a reported attack on the container ship *Cosco Asia*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/09/failed-attack-on-container-ship-cosco-asia-in-the-suez-canal/) while transiting the Suez Canal. A video has appeared on the internet which claims to show the attack.

As reported by [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/video/2013/09/05/amateur-video-shows-two-men-firing-rpgs?videoId=267588952&videoChannel=1):

*The images are grainy. But this video circulating the Internet claims to show two militants firing rocket-propelled grenades at a passing container ship in Egypt’s Suez Canal. Reuters cannot verify the video. But on Saturday canal authorities said terrorists had staged just such an attack to disrupt this critical global waterway. The video shows a back Islamist logo but no Islamist websites have claimed responsibility. Egyptian authorities are confident the attack was random and say three people have since been arrested. And the incident hasn’t affected canal traffic. But Egypt has faced a string of militant attacks in this largely lawless North Sinai region after the army overthrew the country’s first elected Islamist President in July.*
