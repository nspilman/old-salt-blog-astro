![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jeffboat.jpg)Shipbuilding is a capital intensive and highly competitive business.  Remarkably, Jeffboat of Jeffersonville, Indiana, lasted for 184 years. Now, the longest continually operated inland shipyard in the U.S., is [reported to be shutting down.](https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2018/03/24/report-jeffboat-to-shutdown-following-rounds-of.html)  Founded in 1834 on the banks of the Ohio River by steamboat builder James Howard, the yard built 3,000 ships in its first 107 years.  

In 1938,  American Barge Line (ABL) purchased the vacant Sweeny Shipyard adjacent to the Howard Shipyard and named it the Jeffersonville Boat and Machine Company, which would come to be known as Jeffboat.  In 1942, the US Navy bought both shipyards and used the facility to build 123 Landing Ship-Tanks (LSTs), 23 submarine chasers, and numerous other craft. 

In recent years, Jeffboat has been primarily a builder of towboats and barges. Following a drop in orders and a series of layoffs, the management recently told the shipyard union that yard operations would shut down by the end of May.
