At long last, Nessie has been located on the bottom of Loch Ness! The monster is, however, not the legendary beastie, but instead a 30-foot long movie prop which sank in the Loch almost 50 years ago.  The prop was to be used in the filming of “[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTBTDeFfAE0),” directed by Billy Wilder. The model featured a neck and two humps. Director Wilder asked that the humps be removed which adversely affected the model’s buoyancy, causing the model to sink to the lake bottom, where it has been since 1969.  A new model, without humps, was built and the scene was shot in a tank rather than the loch.

The model monster was discovered by a robot drone operated by the Norwegian company [Kongsberg Maritime](http://www.km.kongsberg.com/), which has been working with [VisitScotland](https://www.visitscotland.com/) and Adrain Shine’s [The Loch Ness Project](http://www.lochness.com/exhibition/loch-ness-project.aspx).  The Loch Ness Project is gathering scientific information on the loch’s ecology, as well as keeping an eye out for the legendary monster.

Here is the trailer for the movie, [The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes](https://youtu.be/jTBTDeFfAE0). Scroll ahead to the 2:20 mark to see the replacement Loch Ness monster.
