![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/admfagan.jpg)Congratulations to [Admiral Linda Fagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_L._Fagan), who today assumed command as the 27th commandant of the US Coast Guard. Breaking a major glass ceiling, (or perhaps a glass overhead), she also becomes the first woman to lead the service, as well as the first female service chief in American history.

Sworn in by President Biden at a change-of-command ceremony at US Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, he commented that “There’s no one more qualified to lead the proud women and men of the Coast Guard…”

Fagan, 58, succeeds Adm. Karl L. Schultz, who is retiring.

From the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/01/adm-linda-fagan-becomes-first-woman-lead-us-coast-guard/): Fagan was previously vice commandant, a role she assumed last summer. Her decades of Coast Guard service include a tour on the heavy icebreaker *Polar Star* — the only woman aboard the ship — as well as assignments on every continent. She is also the Coast Guard’s first Gold Ancient Trident, which means she is the officer with the longest service record in the marine safety field.

In his remarks, Biden noted Wednesday that Fagan joined the Coast Guard only five years after the first women graduated from the academy. Women comprised 8 percent of Fagan’s Coast Guard Academy graduating class in 1985, Biden said. By contrast, about 40 percent of the academy’s cadets today are women.

“We need to ensure women have an opportunity to succeed and thrive throughout their professional careers, and that means providing support and resources so women can compete fairly and fully for promotions and make sure women are not penalized in their career for having children,” Biden said. “It also means creating an environment where every member of the armed forces feels safe in the ranks — including from sexual assault and harassment — where their contributions are respected.”
