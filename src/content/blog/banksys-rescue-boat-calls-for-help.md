![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/banksyboat.jpg)The two items in the news appeared within hours of each other. The first, dated August 28, 17:09, was headlined, “[Street artist Banksy funds pink boat to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean](https://www.euronews.com/2020/08/28/street-artist-banksy-funds-pink-boat-to-rescue-migrants-in-the-mediterranean).” The second dated August 29, 5:45 AM was titled, “[Banksy’s migrant rescue boat says overloaded, stranded at sea.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-banksy-alarm-idUSKBN25P0EP?utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook)”

The story behind the headlines is that the British street artist [Banksy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy) has funded a 31-meter boat to be used to rescue migrants in distress in the Mediterranean.  The boat is named *Louise Michel*, after a French feminist anarchist, and began operations last week. The former French Navy craft, daubed in pink and white, is captained by [Pia Klemp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pia_Klemp) and crewed by a team of rescue professionals from across Europe. 

The second half of the story is that *Louise Michel* has picked up 219 migrants off the coast of Libya since Thursday and is attempting to find a safe port in which they may be brought ashore.

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-banksy-alarm-idUSKBN25P0EP?utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook) reports: *The boat, manned by a crew of 10, issued a series of tweets overnight and on Saturday saying its situation was worsening, and appealing in vain for help from authorities in Italy, Malta and Germany.*

*“We are reaching a state of emergency. We need immediate assistance,” said one tweet, adding that it was also carrying a body bag containing the corpse of one migrant who had died.*

*Another said the boat was unable to move and “no longer the master of her own destiny” due to her overcrowded deck and a life raft deployed at her side, “but above all due to Europe ignoring our emergency calls for immediate assistance.”*

The *Louise Michel* is approximately 50 kilometers southeast of the Italian island of Lampedusa, according to [marinetraffic.com.](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/shipid:6246132/zoom:14)

> The crew managed to keep [#LouiseMichel](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LouiseMichel?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) stable for almost 12h now. Our new friends told us they lost 3 friends on their journey already. Including the dead body in our one life raft, that makes 4 lives vanished because of Fortress Europe… And we are still waiting.
