![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/TTSBanner980X217ediot.jpg)New York harbor is not the only port on the North-Eastern coast of the United States with a wealth of tall ships over Memorial Day Weekend.  [Greenport, New York](http://www.greenportvillage.com/about.cfm)  is hosting the [Greenport Tallships Challenge 2012.](http://www.greenportvillage.com/greenportvillage.com/assets_ck/About/files/Greenport_Map5_14.pdf)   Greenport, on the easterly tip of Long Island, is the second stop on the [Tall Ships America’s 2012 TALL SHIPS CHALLENGE Race Series](http://www.sailtraining.org/tallships/2012atlantic/index.php). The sail began in Savannah, Georgia. The participating ships raced up the East Coast to Greenport, Long Island, and then will head off to Newport, Rhode Island (July 6-9) and Halifax, Nova Scotia (July 19-23).

The ships participating include *[HMS Bounty](http://www.tallshipbounty.org/)*, *[Picton Castle](http://www.picton-castle.com/)*, the [privateer schooner *Lynx*](http://www.privateerlynx.com/), the privateer schooner *[Pride of Baltimore II](http://www.pride2.org/)*, as well as the schooners *[Roseway](http://www.worldoceanschool.org/)*, *[Unicorn](http://www.tallshipunicorn.com/)*, and *[Summerwind](http://usmmawaterfront.blogspot.com/2009/11/coast-guard-has-eaglewelcome-summerwind.html)*.    All vessels will be open to visitors and the Roseway will offer sail excursions.  
  
In addition to the ships there will be 10 bands playing over the three days at two band stages, a variety of historical and nautical displays available in Mitchell Park, three different hospitality tents, several sponsor tents and displays and many opportunities for dining and shopping specials within the wonderful galleries, shops and restaurants that make up the Village of Greenport.

Three of the participating vessels recently called in New York. Last week, the Picton Castle tied up alongside Pier 25 on the Hudson River.   See our post and video – [Barque Picton Castle Arrives in New York Harbor](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/05/15/barque-picton-castle-arrives-in-new-york-harbor/).   The *Pride of Baltimore II* and the *Summerwind* are managing to participate in both [OpSail](http://www.opsail.org/) in New York harbor and the [Greenport Tallships Challenge.](http://www.greenportvillage.com/greenportvillage.com/assets_ck/About/files/Greenport_Map5_14.pdf)  See our yesterday’s video [OpSail New York – Parade of Sail](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/05/23/opsail-new-york-parade-of-sail/) in which both schooners make an appearance.  The  *Pride of Baltimore II* arrived with a bang – being the only vessel in the “Parade of Sail” to salute with the ship’s guns.
