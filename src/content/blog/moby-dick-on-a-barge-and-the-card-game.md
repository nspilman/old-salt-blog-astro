For those near New York harbor, the [Brave New World Repertory Theatre](http://bravenewworldrep.org/?utm_source=All+Blast+4.29.2013&utm_campaign=E+blast+4_28_2013&utm_medium=email) is presenting *MOBY DICK–REHEARSED* by Orson Welles, co-directed by John Morgan and Alexander Harrington at [Red Hook’s Waterfront Museum & Showboat Barge](http://waterfrontmuseum.org/) on May 3-5 & 10-12 at 7:30. [Click here for more details.](http://bravenewworldrep.org/?utm_source=All+Blast+4.29.2013&utm_campaign=E+blast+4_28_2013&utm_medium=email) Thanks to Brian Frizell for passing along the news.

Sadly, *Moby-Dick, or, The Whale*, arguably Melville’s masterpiece, only [sold around 3,700 copies during the author’s lifetime and earned him only around $1,300](http://www.melville.org/earnings.htm). Fortunately, [*Moby Dick, or the Card Game*](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/827765657/moby-dick-or-the-card-game?ref=live), a new “dynamic and action-packed card game for 2-4 players, lovingly adapted from Herman Melville’s classic novel,” is doing considerably better. The card game developers are raising money on [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/827765657/moby-dick-or-the-card-game?ref=live) to finish the project. With 26 days to go in the fundraiser, they have exceeded their $25,000 target, raising $43,988, so far, from 1,171 backers.
