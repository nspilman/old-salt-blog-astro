*Research carried out to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar shows many schoolchildren believe that Horatio Nelson was captain of the French national football team in the 1990s.*

*Almost one-in-four also said that ships evacuated British troops from Dover – not Dunkirk – during World War Two, Walter Raleigh invented the bicycle, Captain James Cook was the captain of the Starship Enterprise and Christopher Columbus discovered gravity.*  
  
*The disclosure came in a study of 2,000 secondary school children in England to coincide with the anniversary of Admiral Lord Nelson’s defeat of the Spanish navy in 1805.*

*Children aged 12 to 16 were questioned about a series of key events in maritime history over the last 200 years.*

*The report found six-in-10 youngsters did not know the Battle of Waterloo was fought in Belgium, with one-in-six opting for London’s train station as their answer instead.*

Ignorance of history is by no mens limited to British school children.  A [recent poll](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/civics-education/what-americans-dont-know-about.html) on this side of the pond revealed that twenty-six percent of those surveyed did not know that the United States achieved its independence from Great Britain.
