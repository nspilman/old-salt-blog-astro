![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/08/United_States_Coast_Guard_C.jpg)Happy birthday to the [United States Coast Guard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard)!   Two hundred and twenty years ago today, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, created the Revenue-Marine, later renamed the [Revenue Cutter Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Revenue_Cutter_Service).  For nine years, until the re-establishment of the United States Navy in 1798, the Revenue Cutter Service was the only naval force of the young republic.  The  U.S. Coast Guard was established in 1915 when the Revenue Cutter Service was merged with the [United States Life-Saving Service](http://www.lifesavingservice.org/).    The joining of the two organizations established the Coast Guard’s dual role of life saving and law enforcement.

I see that today is also the birthday of President Obama, who is 171 years younger than the US Coast Guard.  Our best birthday wishes to both.
