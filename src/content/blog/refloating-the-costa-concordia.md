Two and a half years ago,  the cruise ship [*Costa Concordia*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Concordia_disaster) ran aground, sank and capsized with the loss of 32 passengers and crew, off the island of Giglio in the Tyrrhenian Sea off Tuscany.  This morning, the ship was re-floated  as salvors pumped compressed air into 30 large steel tanks welded to both side of the stricken ship.   In roughly a week, the cruise ship will be towed to Genoa to be scrapped.   The salvage of the *Costa Concordia*, which has cost $1 billion dollars, is one the largest salvage operations ever performed.
