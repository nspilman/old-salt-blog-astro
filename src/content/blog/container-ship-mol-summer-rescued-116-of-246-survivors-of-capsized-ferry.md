The officers and crew of the [Mitsui O.S.K. Lines container ship, *MOL Summer*,](http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=1462615) deserve a special commendation for their rescue of 116 people following the capsizing and sinking of the passenger ferry *[MV Rabaul Queen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Rabaul_Queen)* off the coast of Papua New Guinea early Thursday. Eight merchant vessels assisted in the rescue operations.  Of the [246 survivors pulled from the sea](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=22911&action=edit&message=1), the crew of the *MOL Summer* rescued almost half.   Quite an accomplishment in high winds and seas for a crew of only 27.  The 38,332-dwt MOL Summer measures 246.8 m and has a maximum container capacity of 3,586 TEU.
