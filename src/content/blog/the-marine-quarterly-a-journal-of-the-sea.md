![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/03/flyer.jpg)The [Maritime Quarterly](http://www.themarinequarterly.com/), a new maritime journal, was launched on the first of this month.  Looks very interesting.   [Extracts](http://www.themarinequarterly.com/?page_id=66) are available on its website.  About the journal:

*The Marine Quarterly is a new kind of sea journal, reporting subjects of strong interest to everyone who goes on the sea. It will be full of big, authoritative articles on sailing, fisheries, adventuring, merchant shipping, conservation, natural history, heritage, trade, naval matters, and anything else connected with salt water.*  
  
*Its contributors are people who know how to tell a good story well. Topics for the first four issues include a year in the career of a superyacht; the private life of the Atlantic grey seal; a critical analysis of the restoration of the Cutty Sark; the reminiscences of a nervous gap-year student who found himself sailing to Greenland with the adventurer Bill Tilman; and an account of the Thames barge and its modern descendants in the coasting trade.*
