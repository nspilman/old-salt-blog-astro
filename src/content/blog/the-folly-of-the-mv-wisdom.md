The [MV *Wisdom*](http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Mv-Wisdom-8417558.html) is a small 26-year-old container ship.  She has had 14 name changes in her life and no one knows how many owners. The current owner may be unknown as well.  She was being towed from Colombo to the scrap-yard in Alang, India when the tug lost control and the MV *Wisdom* ended up off the beach  in Bandra, in suburban Mumbai.   She very nearly drifted into the [Bandra-Worli Sea Link,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandra%E2%80%93Worli_Sea_Link) a major bridge, but seems to have missed it, as much by luck, as anything else.   [No one can explain why the tow was so close to shore in the first place](http://www.moneylife.in/article/why-was-the-mv-wisdom-allowed-to-get-so-near-the-bandra-worli-sea-link/17245.html).  The course was reportedly inshore of several oil rigs.    Indian police have detained 15 crew members of the tug,  *Minerva*, for negligence.  
  
Fortunately as the ship was bound for a scrap yard, her tanks are clean and empty so there is no risk of pollution.   The [Indian Navy attempted to tow the ship off the beach](http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/navy-begins-operation-to-salvage-mv-wisdom-112688) but failed.  They will try again in a fortnight when the tides are at their most favorable.

In the mean time, [the local police are doing their best to manage the crowds](http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_guards-separate-mv-wisdom-from-hordes_1558021) that have come to gawk at the ship.  This [new toursit destination](http://www.cnngo.com/mumbai/life/cargo-ship-mv-wisdom-pop-tourist-attraction-juhu-beach-770648) has proven to be deadly.  At least one teenage boy has drowned and almost a dozen others have needed to be rescued, including [a lawyer who got too close](http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_lawyer-salvaged-from-stuck-ship-mv-wisdom_1557703).  Despite the ship being in shallow water, waves have carried away the sand around the ship, creating dangerous currents that can sweep the unwary away.

In addition to the gawkers on the beach [the MV *Wisdom* has taken the social networking sites by storm.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Stranded-ship-takes-social-networking-sites-by-storm/articleshow/8944610.cms)

Very little is clear as to exactly how or why the ironically named ship ended up where she did.   No doubt, more will come out over time.  As for now,  all that we see in the MV *Wisdom* is folly.
