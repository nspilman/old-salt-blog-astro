For the next five days, we will be posting about the amazing legacy of the [Herreshoff family](http://www.herreshoff.org/) on American yacht design and construction. Today we begin with the restoration of the yacht *Doris*, the first yacht built to the Universal Rule, developed by Nathanael Herreshoff. Then we will review the careers of John Brown Herreshoff, the blind boatbuilder, and Nathanael Greene Herreshoff, known as the Wizard of Bristol.  Next naval architect and yacht designer, Halsey Herreshoff, will explain how his grandfather, Captain Nat, carved models of his designs. We will follow by a look at *Quiet Tune*, a design by L. Francis Herreshoff, the son of Nathanael and the father of Halsey Herreshoff.
