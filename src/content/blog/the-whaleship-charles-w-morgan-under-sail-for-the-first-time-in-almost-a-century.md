Yesterday, the [*Charles W. Morgan*](http://www.mysticseaport.org/news/2014/the-morgan-sails-again/) set sail for the first time in almost a century.  The whaling ship built in 1841 has been extensively rebuilt at [Mystic Seaport Museum](http://www.mysticseaport.org/) and successfully completed its first day of sea trials in Long Island Sound off New London. Sea trials are continuing today and on June 11, and 12.
