![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bigc.jpg)Andrew Bedwell hopes to set a new world record for sailing the smallest boat to cross the Atlantic. His vessel, *Big C* is just over 1m/3.2ft long. If all goes according to plan he will set off in May 2023 from St Johns, Newfoundland, and finish off Lizard Point in Cornwall.

The smallest boat to cross the Atlantic to date was 5ft 4inches long, sailed by American sailor, [Hugo Vihlen](https://nmmc.co.uk/object/boats/fathers-day-the-smallest-boat-to-cross-the-atlantic/#:~:text=In%20September%201993%2C%20lone%20sailor,smallest%20boat%2C%20measuring%205ft%204inches.) in 1993.

Bedwell will not be able to stand up in his boat without opening the hatch. *Big C* has no bunk so he will nap on a beanbag. A bucket will serve as a toilet.

[Yachting Monthly](https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/cruising-life/crazy-or-sane-record-attempt-for-the-smallest-boat-to-cross-the-atlantic-86938) reports that the boat has 12 watertight compartments – eight internally and four externally – as well as open and closable vents. Once fully sealed, *Big C* only has 40 minutes of air inside before Andrew would pass out.

*Big C* was designed and built by Liverpudlian sailor [Tom McNally](https://culturamarinara.com/en/tom-mcnally-small-boat-crossing-atlantic-ocean/), a legend in micro-yachting, who died in 2017 from cancer. McNally set the smallest boat to cross the Atlantic record in 1993 in his 5ft 4.5-inch boat, *Vera Hugh*. The record was subsequently broken by Hugo Vihlen.
