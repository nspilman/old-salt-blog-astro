![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/10/naveandromeda.jpg)Seven people were detained after British special forces stormed the Liberian registered tanker, *[Nave Andromeda](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:755455/mmsi:636015407/imo:9580405/vessel:NAVE_ANDROMEDA)*, that was suspected of having been hijacked off the Isle of Wight.

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-54687379) reports that sixteen members of the Special Boat Service (SBS) ended a 10-hour standoff which started when stowaways on board the tanker reportedly made violent threats against the crew.

The boarding by the SBS commandoes took place at around 19.30 on Friday after the ship issued a mayday call earlier in the day. [Sky News](https://news.sky.com/story/seven-people-detained-after-special-forces-end-suspected-hijacking-on-tanker-off-isle-of-wight-12114660?fbclid=IwAR0jolH_3U27Da-FHphy83f5R-dVUjPpqNZl7rW6o2W0eTY7W1gH8WaqmoI) reports that the operation involved two Royal Navy Merlin helicopters, along with two Royal Navy Wildcat helicopters. The commandos regained control of the tanker within around seven minutes of boarding the ship. The seven stowaways were captured without harm. 

The stowaways, believed to be Nigerians seeking UK asylum, were handed over to Hampshire Police on Sunday night. The tanker’s 22 crew members were found safe having locked themselves into the ship’s citadel, a safe room containing supplies and communications equipment. The ship later docked in Southampton.
