![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/09/dekkerindianocean.jpg)[Laura Dekker](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/08/21/laura-dekkers-voyage-one-year-on/) has celebrated her 16th birthday and has set sail from Darwin, Australia on a westerly course across the Indian Ocean bound for Africa.  Given the concern about piracy in the Indian Ocean, her exact route is being kept secret.   In 2009, teenage circumnavigator [Zac Sunderland](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/01/28/teenagers-racing-around-the-globe-%E2%80%93-first-zac-then-mike-jessica-and-now-abby/) was shadowed by a boat which may have been pirates near the Cocos Keeling Islands, which may be along Ms. Dekker’s route.   In 2010, Zac’s sister [Abby Sunderland’](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/12/abby-sunderland-rescued-by-french-fishing-vessel-ile-de-la-reunion/)s boat was knocked down and dismasted in the Indian Ocean ending her attempt at solo circumnavigation. Ms. Sunderland attempted to transit the Indian Ocean in mid-Winter whereas  Ms. Dekker will be sailing in the southern hemisphere Spring.
