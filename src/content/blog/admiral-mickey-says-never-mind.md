[Last week we posted about Disney filing  three trademark applications](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/05/16/admiral-mickey-mouse-seal-team-6/) to to claim the rights to the phrase “SEAL Team 6.”  Apparently, Admiral Mickey Mouse has changed his mind.

[Disney Withdraws ‘SEAL Team 6’ Trademark Application](http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/05/disney_withdraws_seal_team_6_trademark_application.php?ref=fpb)

*Out of “deference” to the Navy, Walt Disney Co. has withdrawn an application to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for use of the term “SEAL Team 6,” a company spokesman told [The Wall Street Journal.](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304066504576345752703592770.html)*  
  
*The company originally put the request in two days after President Obama announced that U.S. special forces had killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, and had sought the right to use the term on all sorts of products. A few days later, on May 13, the Navy filed paperwork to trademark ‘SEAL Team’ and ‘Navy SEALs’ (it has a long-standing trademark for the simple “SEALs”).*

*“We are fully committed to protecting our trademark rights,” Navy spokesman Commander Danny Hernandez told the WSJ.*
