![bluenoseiicbc](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/03/bluenoseiicbc.jpg)For the last few years, [we have followed the sad saga](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/?s=Bluenose+II) of the “rebuilding” of the schooner *[Bluenose II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluenose_II)*.  The latest development involves the [replacement of the existing steel rudder and steering system](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/province-replacing-bluenose-rudder-1.3474011) at an estimated additional cost of $1 million Canadian.  The project, which began in 2009, is many years behind schedule and significantly over budget. The original cost has grown from $14 million to a projected $25 million.

While the project is referred to as rebuilding or repair, it is, in fact, the construction of a new schooner. The old schooner was largely put through a wood chipper and a new schooner was built with new keel, frames and planking as well as more modern scantlings. The previous *Bluenose* II was a replica built in 1963 by the Oland Brewery, which was given to the province of Nova Scotia in 1971.  The original *[Bluenose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluenose)* was a fishing and racing schooner built in 1921 famous for winning a series of fishing schooner races in the 1920s and 1930s.

Remarkably, *Bluenose II,* the new rudder will be the third rudder design for the new schooner. The original design was for a wooden rudder and rudder stock. Late in the construction of the schooner, the Canadian government brought in the classification society, the American Bureau of Shipping. In order to meet classification requirements, the wooden rudder and stock were replaced with a steel rudder and stock. The new rudder was too heavy to steer with traditional steering gear, so a hydraulic steering system was installed. The newer heavier rudder never worked properly, suffering bearing and hydraulic failures.  As reported by [CBCNews](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/province-replacing-bluenose-rudder-1.3474011): “*A consultant’s report released Thursday by the Nova Scotia government, the current rudder is so heavy it is adding strain to the schooner’s hull — which could eventually change the shape of the vessel and ultimately reduce its lifespan.*

*When the coming sailing season is over, the plan is to replace the steel rudder with a wooden one or one that is made of a composite material.  That new rudder is expected to cost up to $1 million to design, build and install.**“*

To attempt to put these costs in perspective, the *Bluenose II* cost $300,000 Canadian to build in 1963, which is roughly $2.3 million [in today’s dollars](http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/), or about one-tenth the $25 million which the new schooner is ultimately expected to cost.
