In a marina in the Far Rockaway neighborhood, in the New York City borough of Queens, a summer habitation has grown up from a group of abandoned docks and boats.  Part artists’ colony and part junk yard, the [Boatel at Marina 59](http://marina59.com/boatel.html) is described as :

..*. Summer adventure art camping on boats. The Boatel is an interactive art + sound installation that takes place on the docks of Marina 59, under the planes taking off from JFK airport and five blocks from Rockaway Beach.*

*23 artists from NYC and abroad are meticulously crafting a world out of the flotsam & jetsam of Jamaica Bay. A cluster of reclaimed/rebuilt docks + junk boats create worlds within worlds, an hour from the city and a thousand miles away from reality.*  
  
*You are invited to visit our outpost for an overnight stay in one of our sixteen floating installations–a boat that sings, a patchwork treehouse, a Victorian-era naturalist’s laboratory, a hillbilly kama sutra honeymoon suite…*

*Though we aim to be hospitable, remember that you are joining us in the rough + tumble and please come adventure ready.*

*The Boatel is open Wednesdays to Sundays, May 16th to November 1st.*

Rates for sleeper boats, which house between two and five people, start at $55 a night.  Thanks to [Tony Seideman](http://tonyseideman.com/) for passing along the news.
