![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/montevideomaru.jpg)On July 1, 1942, the submarine [USS *Sturgeon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Sturgeon_\(SS-187\)) was on its fifth war patrol in the South China Sea off the northwest coast of the Philippines’ Luzon Island, when it sighted a Japanese troop transport, [SS *Montevideo Maru*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Montevideo_Maru).  The submarine fired four torpedoes just before dawn, causing the vessel to sink in only 11 minutes. Unbeknownst to those aboard the *Sturgeon*, the *Montevideo Maru* was carrying approximately 1,060 prisoners from around 16 countries, including more than 850 Australian service members. 

An estimated 1,054 prisoners (178 non-commissioned officers, 667 soldiers, and 209 civilians) died when the ship sank. The sinking is considered the worst maritime disaster in Australia’s history.

Australia’s Defence Minister Richard Marles said on Saturday that the wreck of a Japanese merchant ship, sunk in World War Two with 864 Australian soldiers on board, had been found in the South China Sea, ending a tragic chapter of the country’s history.

The long-awaited find comes ahead of April 25 commemorations for Anzac Day, a major day of remembrance in Australia and New Zealand for their troops killed in all military conflicts.

“This brings to an end one of the most tragic chapters in Australia’s maritime history,” Marles said in a video message.

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-says-discovery-ww2-shipwreck-ends-tragic-maritime-chapter-2023-04-22/) reports that the search for the wreck, found at a depth of more than 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) was led by a maritime archaeology not-for-profit and deep-sea survey specialists, and supported by Australia’s Defence department, according to the government.
