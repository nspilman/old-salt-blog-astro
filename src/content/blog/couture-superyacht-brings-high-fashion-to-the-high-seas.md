I will admit to being easily amused, but I found this to be very funny.  For those with more money than sense, here is a “couture superyacht” designed by a fashion designer.   I would worry that it might be more fashionable than seaworthy but it does look rather conventional overall.  (As a naval architect, I  promise that I will never, ever design clothes.)

*The world’s most fashionable women may finally have the perfect place to show off their designer dresses: A haute couture superyacht.*

*Couturier Elie Saab, whose clientele includes actresses Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, recently unveiled his design for a 117-meter superyacht.*

*Designing red carpet dresses and high-tech superyachts might not seem the most natural bedfellows, but the Lebanese designer believes this latest venture is a natural extension of his fashion empire.*

*“I always sought to represent my vision of modernity and elegance beyond the conventional limits of fashion,” Saab told CNN.*

*“Both haute couture and superyachts are distinctive examples of luxury. The project of a yacht is already a luxury.*

*“Adding a designer’s vision to the creation is the ultimate luxury,” he said of the design which was launched at last month’s Abu Dhabi yacht show*
