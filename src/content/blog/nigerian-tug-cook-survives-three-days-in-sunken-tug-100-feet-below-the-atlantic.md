At the end of last May, the [*Jascon 4* sank in about 100 feet of water](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/10115919/Nigerian-cook-tells-how-he-survived-for-three-days-trapped-under-sunken-ship.html) off the coast of Nigeria.  All twelve of the crew were believed to have drowned.  Three days later, divers were sent into the sunken tug to retrieve the bodies.  They had recovered four bodies when one diver saw a hand and reached for it, only to be shocked when the hand reached back. [Harrison Odjegba Okene, the tug’s cook, had miraculously survived](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/man-survives-60-hours-at-bottom-of-atlantic/2013/12/03/cd1e432a-5c4c-11e3-8d24-31c016b976b2_story.html) in an air pocket for close to three days. The video of the moment when Okene was found has recently been released.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for contributing to this post.
