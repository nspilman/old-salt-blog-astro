![ivarssign](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ivarssign.jpg)We previously posted about the [Royal Navy installing Windows on submarines](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2009/03/14/windows-on-submarines/). We were relieved to learn that the  reference was to an a computer operating system and not panes of glass.    Then again, it appears that the late Ivar Haglund, owner of the Seattle restaurant chain, [Ivar’s Seafood](http://ivars.net/index.php), expected submarine viewers when he installed underwater billboards for submarines in Puget Sound over fifty years ago.  On the other hand, some suggest that it may all be a hoax.

[Is there something fishy about Ivar’s latest stunt?](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009889864_ivar18m.html)  
  
*There apparently were plans for seven underwater billboards.*

*In the past month, the company has had divers bring up three of the billboards — about 7 by 22 feet and made of stainless steel — using a map found in their founder’s immense collection of artifacts stored on the top floor of the chain’s headquarters at Pier 54.*

*Seattle historian Paul Dorpat also says he doesn’t believe the billboards are hoaxes.*

*If anyone should know about Ivar Haglund, it is Dorpat. He is writing a book about Haglund, and interviewed him a number of times. Dorpat also has been granted access to all of Haglund’s archives.*

*“As far as I can tell, it’s the real thing,” says Dorpat about the papers documenting Ivar’s plans for the billboards. It was Dorpat who found the documents.*

*Dorpat says Haglund would be very proud that more than a half-century after he — allegedly — dreamed up the underwater billboards, they were making news.*

*“This is the ghost of Ivar Haglund,” says Dorpat. “The greatest self-promoter in the history of Seattle. He will not die.”*
