![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/norwegian-spirit.jpg)Late season cruises have their own inherent risks. In the case of a recent cruise on the [*Norwegian Spirit*](https://www.cruisecritic.com/reviews/review.cfm?ShipID=299) these risks were compounded by the remnants of Hurricane Lorenzo, now a post-tropical storm, which was pounding the Atlantic Coast of Europe. 

The 2,016 passenger *Norwegian Spirit* left Southampton on September 27th, bound for a two-week cruise with nine port calls in the Netherlands, Norway, Iceland, and Ireland. It was billed as the “Mystical Fjords” cruise. For many of its passengers, it would become the “cruise from hell,” featuring missed port calls, spoiled food, and overflowing toilets. Before it was all over, the passengers were in a near mutiny and close to rioting

The trouble began when port calls in IJmuiden, near Amsterdam and then LeHavre, France were canceled due to high winds. The ship sailed on for Norway, but instead of docking in Bergen and Flam as shown on the [itinerary](https://www.cruisemapper.com/ships/Norwegian-Spirit-702), the ship went to the Norwegian town of Hellesylt, which was essentially closed for the season. The promised “mystical fjords” were only visible in the extreme distance.

The *Norwegian Spirit* then set off across the North Sea to Iceland where it was scheduled to make port calls in Akureyri and Reykjavik, but once again, the ship was turned away due to weather. The captain steered next for Greenock, near Glasgow, Scotland, only to be turned back by poor conditions and a delayed military ship tied up at the dock. The ship ultimately made dock in Belfast.

Suffice it to say, the passengers weren’t happy. After spending days at sea with the promised itinerary a shambles, passengers complained that the food was beginning to turn bad and that the ship’s sewage system was failing.  Many were demanding a refund for the trip and a near-riot broke out when Norwegian Cruise Lines offered 25% discount vouchers instead. Security was called and passengers were threatened with arrest.

The [Daily Mail](http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7551905/Cruise-ship-passengers-5-300-mystical-fjords-tour-rebel-tell-crew-want-liner.html) reports that the ‘near rioting’ was filmed on passengers’ phones but one tourist claimed the crew turned off the ship’s internet to stop the footage going online. Passengers later held up placards saying ‘shame on you’ and ‘we want refunds’.

Deena Roland, 48, from Taunton, Devon, who was traveling with husband Adrian, 48, said: ‘There are a lot of angry people on this ship and the lack of adequate explanation as to what’s going on almost caused a riot this morning.

‘It’s been a nightmare of a holiday, and now many of the toilets in the cabins are overflowing with sewage. It’s really not my idea of a luxury cruise break.’

Many passengers left the ship after it stopped in Belfast and decided to make their own way back to London.

Given the known weather conditions, it is arguable that NCL should have simply canceled the cruise.
