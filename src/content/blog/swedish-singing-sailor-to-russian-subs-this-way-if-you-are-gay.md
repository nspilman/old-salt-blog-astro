![singingsailor1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/05/singingsailor1.jpg)In the general category of “you can’t make this stuff up,” the [Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society](http://www.svenskafreds.se/) (SPAS), a group dedicated to the study and promotion of peace, released details of their [“Singing Sailor Campaign.”](http://www.svenskafreds.se/singingsailor/)

Last October, we posted about a reported incursion into Swedish waters by what was believed to be a foreign and probably Russian submarine.  See our post “[Swedish Navy Still Hunting Mystery Submarine](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/10/swedish-navy-still-hunting-mystery-submarine/).” The Swedish Navy searched for the submarine but couldn’t locate it. In the wake of this failure to track down the submarine intruder, there have been calls for increased military spending in Sweden.

[SPAS is suggesting a different approach.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/05/12/swedens-new-message-to-russian-submarines-this-way-if-you-are-gay/) They have proposed the “Singing Sailor subsurface defense system,” which would involve lowering submarine message buoys featuring an animated dancing sailor attired only in underwear and a sailors cap, with the messenge, “*Welcome to Sweden, Gay Since 1944*.” The buoy would also send the Morse code message, ‘*This way if you are gay*.’  Given that Russia has recently been increasingly homophobic in its policies, this otherwise welcoming message might be enough to turn Russian subs away.  See the video after the page break.
