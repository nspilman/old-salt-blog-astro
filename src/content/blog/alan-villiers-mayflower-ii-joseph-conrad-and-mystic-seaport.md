Alan Villiers

While not a particular believer in ghosts, if the ghost of [Alan Villiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Villiers) is about, I suspect that he must smiling.  The arrival of the [*Mayflower II*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower_II) at [Mystic Seaport Museum](http://www.mysticseaport.org/) is the reunion, of sorts, of two ships long associated with the sailing ship captain and pioneer in sail training.   In mid December, the *Mayflower II* was towed from Plymouth, MA to the Henry B. duPont Preservation Shipyard at Mystic Seaport in Connecticut where she will begin the first phase of a multi-year restoration.

The *Mayflower II*, a replica of the original ship which carried the Pilgrims across the Atlantic in 1620, has been the one of the key exhibits at the [Plimoth Plantation](http://www.plimoth.org/) at the State Pier on Plymouth’s waterfront.  In 2013, the ship was found to be in need of a major refit.   As noted on the Mystic Seaport website:

Mayflower II

“*The restoration of the 57-year-old wooden ship will be carried out over several years with the ship spending winter and spring at Mystic Seaport and returning to Plymouth each summer and fall. The project is scheduled for completion prior to 2020–the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ arrival.”*

So what does this have to do with Alan Villiers?  If the name is not familiar, Villiers was a master mariner, author, and adventurer, who first went to sea at age 15 and sailed the world’s oceans on board the last of the great windjammers, including the full-rigged ships [*Herzogin Cecilie,*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzogin_Cecilie) [*Grace Harwar*](http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Merchant/Sail/G/Grace_Harwar%281889%29.html) and the [*Parma*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parma_%28barque%29), of which he was part owner. He also commanded square-rigged ships for films, including [*Moby Dick*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Dick_\(1956_film\)) and [*Billy Budd*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Budd_\(film\)).  In 1957, Villiers commanded the *Mayflower II* on its maiden voyage from the United Kingdom to the United States, arriving in New York City on Monday, July 1, of that year.  Captain Villiers and his crew were welcomed with a ticker tape parade.

Joseph Conrad

The other ship long associated with Captain Villiers is the full rigged iron ship, *[Joseph Conrad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad_\(ship\)),* which has been a museum ship at Mystic Seaport since 1947*.*  Built in 1882 as the *Georg Stage,* Villiers saved her from the scrap yard and renamed her *Joseph Conrad*.  In a pioneering sail training venture, Captain Villiers circumnavigated the globe in 1934-1936, sailing the ship with an amateur crew. The *Joseph Conrad now* serves as a static training vessel and is employed by Mystic Seaport to house campers attending the Joseph Conrad Sailing Camp.

Alan Villiers died in 2003 at the age of 79.  No doubt he would have be pleased to see the *Mayflower II* being refurbished and that the 123 year old *Joseph Conrad* is still training young sailors in the ways of the sea.
