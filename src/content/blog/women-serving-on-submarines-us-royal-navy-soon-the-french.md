Like many milestones, once it is past, it doesn’t seem like quite as big a deal.  Last week, [three women made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the Royal Navy](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2620232/Sailing-history-books-Navys-women-submariners-Trio-complete-months-training-earn-Dolphins.html).

Female officers have served on US Navy submarines for the past several years.  Since the end of the ban on female submariners in 2010, [43 female US Navy officers](http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=77079) have served aboard six Ohio-class ballistic-missile (SSBN) and guided-missile submarines (SSGN).  Submarines with women currently serving on board include USS *Florida*, USS *Georgia* and USS *Wyoming*, homeported in Kings Bay, Ga., and USS *Ohio*, USS *Louisiana*, and USS *Maine*, homeported in Bangor, Wash.

Based on the [success of female officers](http://www.navytimes.com/article/20120618/NEWS/206180310/Women-say-they-re-fitting-submarines) on the larger submarines, the [first female officers will be assigned to the smaller fast attack submarine](http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=77079) *USS Virginia* starting in January 2015.   There are currently plans to allow [female enlisted personnel to serve on US submarines in 2016](http://www.navytimes.com/article/20140419/CAREERS02/304190030/Navy-surveys-female-sailors-sub-duty), although it has not been decided whether they will serve on attack boats or ballistic-missile subs.

The French recently announced that [women will be allowed to serve on nuclear submarines in the French Navy](http://www.english.rfi.fr/france/20140415-french-navy-announces-first-women-serve-submarines) starting in 2017.
