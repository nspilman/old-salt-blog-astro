Yesterday morning, the 14,400 TEU container ship, [CMA CGM *Theodore Roosevelt*](https://www.porttechnology.org/news/cma_cgm_theodore_roosevelt_breaks_us_east_coast_record), sailed under the newly-elevated Bayonne Bridge becoming the largest container ship ever to call on the Port of New York and New Jersey.  She previously set a record as the largest ship to navigate through the Panama Canal. She is also the largest container ship to make a port call on the United States East Coast.  For more photos [click here](http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2017/09/see_largest_container_ship_on_east_coast_pass_unde.html#incart_2box_hudson).

The ship is 1,202 feet (366 meters) long — the length of four football fields — and 166 feet (50 meters) wide.

Her arrival was made possible by a 4 year, $1.6 billion dollar project to raise the Bayonne Bridge to allow large container ships to reach container terminals on Staten Island and in Elizabeth and Newark, NJ.  The bridge roadway was raised by 64 feet to make room for the larger ships made possible by the widening of the Panama Canal.
