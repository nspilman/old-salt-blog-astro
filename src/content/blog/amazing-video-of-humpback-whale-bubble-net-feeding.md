Here is a breathtaking video of humpback whales [bubble-net feeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble-net_feeding) in Alaska shot by the [University of Hawaii, Mānoa Marine Mammal Research Program](https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2019/10/13/whale-bubble-net-feeding-video/) (MMRP). The whales use bubbles to create virtual nets to herd their prey. The video was captured using aerial drones and also by cameras attached by suction cups to the whales to give a whale’s eye view perspective. Simply amazing.
