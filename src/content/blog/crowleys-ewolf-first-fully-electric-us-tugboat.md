![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ewolf.jpg)[Crowley Maritime Corporation has announced](https://www.crowley.com/news-and-media/press-releases/ewolf-electric-tug/) that it will build and operate *eWolf*, the first all-electric powered harbor tugboat in the United States. The electric ship assist and escort tug will be 200 GRT, 82 feet long, with a main propulsion battery of 6.2 MWh, and a bollard pull of 70 short tons. 

Over the first 10 years of its use, the operation of the new eTug will reduce 178 tons of nitrogen oxide (NOx), 2.5 tons of diesel particulate matter, and 3,100 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) versus a conventional tug. The electric tug will replace one that consumes more than 30,000 gallons of diesel per year. The *eWolf* will operate at the Port of San Diego’s Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal and will be operational by mid-2023.

The *eWolf* will be built by Master Boat Builders in Coden, Ala., utilizing the design and on-site construction management by Crowley Engineering Services and its recently integrated Jensen Maritime naval architecture and marine engineering group. The *eWolf*’s battery system will be charged at a specially designed, shoreside station developed with Cochran Marine.

“The *eWolf* represents everything Crowley stands for: innovation, sustainability, and performance. With this groundbreaking tug design, our team continues to embrace our role as leaders in the maritime industry while providing our customers with innovative and sustainable solutions done right,” said company Chairman and CEO Tom Crowley.
