*The submarine wreck was discovered by a research ship of the Swedish Maritime Administration the 10 September. A closer study with a radio-controlled underwater vessel indicate that the submarine may be ‘Gepard’, one of twelve submarines of the Bars (snow leopard) class who operated in the Baltic Sea during WW1. “We have a strong suspicion that it’s ‘Gepard’, says Hans Oiås, responsible for the Swedish database of shipwrecks, to news agency TT.*  
  
*The submarine with 40 people in the crew was, according to Oiås, on a mission together with other submarines to guard a line of mines west of the Estonian island Saaremaa. It was reported lost in October 1917, but has now most likely been found after 92 years on international waters, 30 admiralty miles northeast of the Swedish island Gotska Sandön.*
