The title may be a bit unfortunate, but it is an interesting documentary nevertheless, featuring the brigantine *Tres Hombres*. The documentary trailer is posted below. The [entire documentary can be watched here](http://www.maartenkal.com/en/documentaries/How-Captain-Longhair-saved-the-world).

*Three weeks after the devastating earthquake on Haiti in 2010, eleven idealists depart from Holland with their self-build wooden sailing vessel Tres Hombres. Their mission is to help the people of Haiti. On board they bring a mix of aid supplies; pick axes, diapers, a scooter and even teddy bears. ‘The people in Haiti need our goods, that’s why we have to sail as fast as possible’ Captain Arjen van der Veen tells his crew. But in the never-ending waters, boredoms strikes and the good intentions of their heroic mission elaborate in heated discussions about the nearing end of the world. Does the Captain know what he is fighting for?*
