HMS Spiteful

In our [post about the passing of Bill King](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/09/22/bill-king-oldest-submarine-commander-solo-circumnavigator-dies-at-102/), we originally referred to him as the last surviving World War II submarine commander. Apparently, that is not the case.  We learned from Pat Barnhouse on the MarHist list that “Lieutenant [Commander Fred Sherwood DSC & Bar RCNVR](http://uboat.net/allies/commanders/2889.html) is still alive here in Ottawa.”  We believe that Lcdr Sherwood is 97.

From [Living History](http://www.fleetairarmarchive.com/videos/Livinghistory.html):  *Lieut. Commander Fred H. Sherwood DSC & Bar RCNVR – his first submarine command was “P556”, a very old ex-US Navy submarine he nicknamed ‘The Reluctant Dragon’ because frequently, she didn’t want to dive!*

[From The Perisher Club:](http://www.frontline-canada.com/Defence/index_archives.php?page=1494) *Lcdr Sherwood was the first Canadian Officer to command a British Submarine during WWII, HMS Spiteful. Under his command, Spiteful totalled the three longest patrols for an S-Boat at the time, sinking multiple Japanese ships. By April 1945, Spiteful had bombarded installations on the Andaman Islands and Christmas Island.*
