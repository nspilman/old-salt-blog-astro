![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lightsail2deployed.jpg)For a number of years, we have followed the [Planetary Society](http://planetary.org/)‘s efforts to launch a solar sail which would be propelled by light radiating from the sun. Yesterday, the society’s LightSail 2 deployed a 32-square-meter solar sail, about the size of a boxing ring, in Earth orbit. 

LightSail 2 is the first spacecraft in Earth orbit to be propelled only by sunlight. The craft will orbit the earth powered by the momentum of solar photons striking the sail. 

LightSail 2 is the Planetary Society’s second crowdfunded solar sail spacecraft.  The Planetary Society is a non-government, nonprofit organization committed to advancing space science and exploration.

“We use the term boom just like on a sailboat, to hold the sails out, because we’re twisting relatively fast in Earth orbit,” explained Bill Nye, former host of *Bill Nye the Science Guy* and now CEO of the nonprofit Planetary Society, [to the press before launch](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-sailing-success-planetary-society-deploys-lightsail-2/). “We go edge on toward the sun, twist 90 degrees, go face on and get a full push like a sailboat going downwind, building orbital energy. \[We\] then twist again on the night side of the Earth and twist on the day side, over and over.”

LightSail 2 is expected to remain in orbit for about the next year until atmospheric friction will cause it to fall back to Earth and burn up in the atmosphere.

The idea of [solar sailing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail) dates back to 1610, when Johannes Kepler observed that comet tails point away from the sun as if pushed by a celestial wind.  In a letter to Galileo, he wrote, “Provide ships or sails adapted to the heavenly breezes, and there will be some who will brave even that void.”
