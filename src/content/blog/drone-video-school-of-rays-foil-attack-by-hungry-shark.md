Sharks are among the top predators of sting rays. Here is a short video of a large school of stingrays narrowly escaping a shark attack in September off Anna Maria Island, in Manatee County, FL. The drone footage, captured by Justin Nadeau, shows the [schooling behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling) of the rays foiling the shark attack. By the video’s end, the shark swims away hungry, failing to catch a single ray. Thanks to [Alaric Bond](https://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing along the video.
