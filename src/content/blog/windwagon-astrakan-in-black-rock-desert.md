Unfortunately, despite sailing around 100 miles down the Santa Fe trail, his “Prairie Clipper Company” was not a commercial success.  Now a team of Swedish tall ship sailors, riggers, carpenters, filmakers and engineers have built designed and built the [windwagon *Astrakan*, to “*sail.. in the wake of Wind Wagon Tomas*.”](http://www.windwagonproject.se/)  Recently they posted a video of the *Astrakan* sailing in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert.  Thanks to [Tom Russell](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=13370427&authType=name&authToken=etG3&goback=%2Eamf_2041742_13370427&trk=anetppl_profil) on the Linked-in [Traditional Sail Professionals](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2041742&trk=myg_ugrp_ovr) group for pointing it out.
