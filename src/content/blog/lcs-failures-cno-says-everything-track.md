![ssmontgomery2](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/09/ssmontgomery2.jpg)Recently, the USS *[Montgomery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Montgomery_\(LCS-8\))*, an Independence Class [Littoral Combat Ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littoral_combat_ship) (LCS), established a new record. The [ship broke down, suffering two unrelated engine failures only three days after being commissioned.](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/09/17/lcs-montgomery-suffers-two-engine-casualties-days-commissioning.html)  The previous record had been set by the [*USS Milwaukee*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Milwaukee_\(LCS-5\)), a [Freedom Class LCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom-class_littoral_combat_ship), which [suffered a total engine failure](https://www.rt.com/usa/325710-littoral-ship-milwaukee-breakdown/) twenty days after commissioning. Unlike the *Milwaukee,* which required a tow to return to port, the *Montgomery* was able to limp into port under its own power.

This was the third LCS in three weeks to suffer major engine problems and the fifth within a year.  We recently [posted that the three Freedom Class LCS in service](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/08/freedom-class-lcs-service-100-failure-rate-last-year/), each had suffered a major breakdown in the last year, achieving an unenviable 100% failure rate. The Independence Class is not far behind. Two weeks prior to the problems on the *Montgomery*, the Independence Class USS *[Coronado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Coronado_\(LCS-4\))* [broke down on its first deployment](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/08/30/another-littoral-combat-ship-breaks-down-during-pacific-transit.html). Overall of the seven LCS in service, only two have not suffered a major failure within the last year.

In light of these failures, earlier this month the the commander, [Naval Surface Forces (NAVSURFOR), “ordered an engineering stand down for every \[Littoral Combat Ship\] crew](https://news.usni.org/2016/09/05/navy-ordered-littoral-combat-ship-engineering-stand-retraining-ongoing) to review procedures and standards for their engineering departments,” according to a statement by the Navy.

Nevertheless, the Chief of Naval Operations, [Adm. John Richardson, does not seem to be worried.](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/09/21/lcs-program-still-on-track-despite-breakdowns-cno-says.html) This week he was quoted as saying, “I think that overall, this program is on track. As with any program of this complexity, we have some very bright people who are making these decisions, designing this program, getting it to sea. But it’s really complicated. So while we have maybe a 90-percent solution, we’re going to learn. And that’s where we are.”

One of the reason that the program is so complicated is that the Navy is building two different designs of LCS. The ships, designed to operate in coastal waters, are slightly smaller than conventional frigates. The [Freedom Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom-class_littoral_combat_ship) is a 358′ long conventional monohull design while the [Independence Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence-class_littoral_combat_ship) is a 418′ long trimaran design. Both designs were intended to be converted for various duties with the installation of rapidly interchangeable mission modules.

While the Navy is obviously having serious problems with these two designs, they are also planning on building a third variation, a Fast Frigate (FF) version of the Freedom class. The frigate version will have more armour, better weaponry but lack the interchangeable module capability.  A [recent report by the General Accounting Office (GAO)](http://breakingdefense.com/2016/06/navy-pushed-too-hard-too-fast-to-get-lcs-frigate-gao/) concluded that the frigate variations was not a significant improvement over the the original LCS design.

The various LCS ships have been averaging around a half billion dollars each and the Navy currently plans on ordering around 40, down from original plans fro 52.

Admiral Richardson’s comment that “this program is on track” reminds me of the old joke about the man who jumps off the roof of a 50 story building, and is heard to say as he passes the 25 floor, “So far, so good.”
