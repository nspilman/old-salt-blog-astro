![ohpricollage1](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ohpricollage1.jpg)Sailing School Vessel (SSV) [*Oliver Hazard Perry*](http://www.ohpri.org/) will be docking at her new permanent berth this Saturday at [Fort Adams State Park](http://www.riparks.com/Locations/LocationFortAdams.html) in Newport, RI. She is the first ocean-going full-rigged ship built in America in over a century. She will be available for viewing Tuesday afternoon, May 5 through May 12 and will be hosting public tours Saturday, May 9th through Monday, May 11th (9 a.m. – 5 p.m.) and on Tues, May 12th (9 a.m. – 3 p.m.)

From the [OHPRI](http://www.ohpri.org/) press release: *The impressive silhouette of SSV Oliver Hazard Perry includes a towering rig, the tallest part of which reaches 13 ½ stories high; a total of 19 spars that have been turned from massive Douglas fir trees on the largest spar lathe in North America; seven miles of rope and wire that have been made integral to the ship’s operation by tradesmen trained in both modern and traditional rigging techniques; and 20 sails, both square and fore-and-aft that total 14,000 square feet.*

*As a Sailing School Vessel, the Tall Ship will carry not passengers but students of all ages participating in [academic and experiential learning programs](http://www.ohpri.org/ohp-programs) aboard while engaging in all aspects of shipboard life.*
