![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/newyorkpacket.jpg)In May, [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/04/virtual-shanty-chantey-sing-part-1-south-street-seaport/) about the virtual return New York’s [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/)‘s monthly Chantey Sing.  It was great fun. The next Seaport Chantey sing is scheduled for this Sunday, July 5th. From the Seaport press release: 

South Street Seaport Museum’s monthly sea-music Sea Chanteys and Maritime Music continues – virtually. From our living rooms and kitchens, and even from the deck of Wavertree, join our round-robin of shared songs, featuring members of the New York Packet and friends. Listen in, lead or request a song, and belt out the choruses for your neighbors to hear during a Virtual Chantey Sing on Sunday, July 5, 2020 from 2-4pm. The event is FREE. Sign up here to receive the Zoom link 24 hours prior: [http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?llr=4pcqx8iab&oeidk=a07eh55kqffdc22ec73](http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?llr=4pcqx8iab&oeidk=a07eh55kqffdc22ec73).

The Chantey on July 5 will include The Star-Spangled Banner, which was inspired by the large U.S. flag above Fort McHenry during the U.S. victory during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. 

Old-time sailors on long voyages spent months living together in close quarters with no outside entertainment, no new people to interact with, a monotonous diet, and each day pretty much just like the day before. Sound familiar?  How did they keep their spirits up? Singing together! Work songs and fun songs, story songs and nonsense songs, songs of nostalgia and songs of up-to-the-moment news – all were part of the repertoire onboard. At South Street Seaport Museum, the Chantey tradition lives on.
