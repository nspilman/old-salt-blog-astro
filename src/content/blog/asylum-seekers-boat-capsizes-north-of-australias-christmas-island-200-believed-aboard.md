With a sad familiarity, another overloaded boat, filled with desperate asylum seekers trying to reach Australia’s Christmas Island, has capsized in Indonesian waters. Up to 200 people are believed to have been aboard the vessel when it capsized.  Indonesia’s search and rescue authority BASARNAS is coordinating the search with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA).  West Australian Police Commissioner Karl O’Callaghan has been quoted as saying that said about 40 people were spotted on the upturned hull, others were in the water and up to 75 others may be dead. “We have grave fears for the remainder,” he said.

The current capsize with a probable signification loss of life is, sadly, nothing new.    In [December of 2010 an estimated 50 refugees died](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/12/15/tragedy-on-christmas-island-asylum-seekers-die-in-shipwreck/) when their boat struck the rocks off Christmas Island’s Flying Fish Cove.   In December of 2011, more than [200 refugees went missing and were presumed dead](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/12/18/more-than-200-missing-as-asylum-seekers-ship-sinks-off-indonesia/) when their boat bound for Christmas Island sank off Indonesia.  In April of this year, 1[29 Afghan refugees were rescued](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/04/09/indonesia-rescues-129-afghan-refuguees-from-leaking-ship/) from a sinking ship also bound for Christmas Island.
