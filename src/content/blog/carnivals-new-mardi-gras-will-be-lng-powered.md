![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mardigras.jpg)[Carnival Corporation](http://www.carnivalcorp.com/) is the world’s largest cruise line, operating over 100 ships across nine brands. Back in 1972, however, it owned only one ship, the [TSS *Mardi Gras*, of 27,000 GRT and carrying roughly 1,000 passengers](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2017/03/carnivals-first-ship-tss-mardi-gras/).

Now, Carnival is building a new *Mardi Gras* of 180,000 GT and capable of carrying 5,200 passengers. When delivered it will be the largest cruise ship in the Carnival fleet. The new *Mardi Gras* will be distinctive for more than just its size. In addition to being the only cruise ship with an onboard roller coaster, it will also be powered by Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). 

The new cruise ship is being assembled at the Meyer Turku shipyard in Finland yesterday. The engine room, a 140-meter long x 42 m wide unit, was fabricated at another Meyer shipyard, Neptun Werft, in Rostock, Germany, and was floated to the yard in Finland where it will be joined with other ship fabrication blocks.

[Marine Log](https://www.marinelog.com/news/meyer-turku-starts-mardi-gras-hull-assembly/) reports that *Mardi Gras* is set to debut in Europe Aug. 31, 2020, then reposition to New York for a series of voyages before shifting to Port Canaveral, Fla., for year-round Caribbean departures.
