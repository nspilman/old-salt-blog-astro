The grounding of the the USS Guardian appears to be roughly the third time that a writ of kalikasan has been sought.  The [first was directed against an electric power distribution company](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/205707/news/nation/first-ever-writ-of-kalikasan-petition-filed-vs-meralco) in 2010. That case is still pending trial. In the second case, also in 2010 against an oil pipeline company,  a [writ of kalikasan was issued and the pipeline was shut down.](http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/19/10/sc-issues-writ-kalikasan-shuts-down-fpic-pipeline)

The [Tubbataha Reef is a UNESCO World Heritage site](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/653) and the grounding is believed to have damaged 2,346 square meters of the reef.  To remove the ship from the reef, the USS Guardian was cut into pieces and hauled away by barge.  earlier this month the Navy relieved the commanding officer, [Lt. Cmdr. Mark Rice,  and three others.](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/302360/news/nation/us-navy-relieves-uss-guardian-commander-3-others-over-tubbataha-incident)
