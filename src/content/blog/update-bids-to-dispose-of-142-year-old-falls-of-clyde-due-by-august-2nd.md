![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/FOCnow2.jpg)The Hawaii Department of Transportation’s Harbors Division put out a second request for proposals (RFP) for the [“removal of the derelict sailing vessel](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/05/last-ditch-appeal-to-save-the-tall-ship-falls-of-clyde-from-scrapping-or-scuttling/) [*Falls of Clyde*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_of_Clyde_\(ship\)) from Honolulu Harbor.” A previous RFP issued in late April was later canceled after a review had found “not all state processes were followed.” The new RFP requires that bids be submitted by August 2nd.

The [Star Advertiser](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2021/07/01/breaking-news/take-two-hawaii-officials-once-again-solicit-bids-to-dispose-of-the-historic-falls-of-clyde/) reports that the contractor will need to comply with any and all federal, state, and county laws, statutes, and regulations including, but not limited to environmental and historic preservation acts, as well as consultations with federal agencies and other requirements.

Services must also include facilitating and conducting, if needed, community involvement regarding the DOT’s disposal of the derelict vessel.

Additionally, the DOT director “reserves the right to cancel this Request for Proposals, to reject any or all proposals in whole or in part or to waive any defects in any proposal in the best interest of the State of Hawaii.”

The *Falls of Clyde*, launched in 1878 in Port Glasgow, Scotland, is the only remaining iron-hulled four-masted full-rigged ship and the only surviving sail-driven oil tanker in the world.
