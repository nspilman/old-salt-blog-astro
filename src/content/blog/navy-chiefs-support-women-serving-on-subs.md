*Women should be allowed to serve aboard submarines, and the Navy is “moving out aggressively” to make it happen, according to the service’s top civilian.*

*“I believe women should have every opportunity to serve at sea, and that includes aboard submarines,” Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said Thursday in a statement to Navy Times.*  
  
*His comment comes one week after Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen told congressional lawmakers he thought it was time to end the ban against women on submarines.*

*Mullen’s successor, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead, also said he is “very comfortable” addressing the crewing policy.*

The statements have set off significant on-line discussion among naval personnel.
