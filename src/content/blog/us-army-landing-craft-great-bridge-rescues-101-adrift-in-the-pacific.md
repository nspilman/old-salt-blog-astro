USAV GREAT BRIDGE

It is easy to forget how many ships and boats are indeed operated by the United States Army. Earlier this week the 80 feet long vessel, *Enin Meto*, with 101 people aboard, was bound from [Lib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib_Island) to [Ebeye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebeye_Island), two island in the Marshall Islands chain in the Pacific, when their engine broke down. Using a battery operated radio, the *Enin Meto*‘s crew contacted USAKA (United States Army Kwajalein Atoll) Operations, which dispatched the LCU *Great Bridge* to find the stricken vessel. In high seas on a very dark night, the *Great Bridge* finally located the Enin Meto and towed the boat and her passengers to the island of Ebye.  Ebye is  the most populous of the more than a dozen islands that make up the Kwajalein Atoll.

The *Great Bridge* is a [Runnymede class large landing craft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runnymede_class_large_landing_craft) 174 ft (53 m) long, with a beam of 42 ft (13 m), a draft of 8.5 ft (2.6 m) and a displacement of 1,102 long tons.
