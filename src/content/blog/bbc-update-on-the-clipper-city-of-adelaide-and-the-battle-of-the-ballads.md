![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2009/12/adelaidebow.jpg)BC apparently has posted an [interesting videocast on the composite clipper City of Adelaide](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0071mnc).  I write apparently because it is available only in Britain and being on the other side of the pond I can only take the word of my British friends.   The BBC does have an [interesting blog post](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chrisjackson/2010/02/sunderland_campaign_to_rescue.html) nevertheless.  Thanks to [David Hayes](http://www.historicnavalfiction.com/) for passing the link along.

[Is bringing a tall ship back to the Wear too much of a tall order?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chrisjackson/2010/02/sunderland_campaign_to_rescue.html)

In more of less related news a battle of the ballads has broken out between UK singer/songwriters and an Australian singer songwriter. All are attempting to pen and sing music to save the ship though the Brits want her to be returned to the River Ware where she was built, while the Australian would like her returned to her namesake city.
