![ns-letter-320](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ns-letter-320.jpg)A 23 year old Croatian kite surfer, Matea Medak Rezic, [found a letter in a broken bottle](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/04/17/ns-bottle-message-arrives.html) on a beach at the mouth of the Neretva River in the southern Adriatic. The letter was brief:

*“Mary, you really are a great person. I hope we can keep in correspondence. I said I would write. Your friend always, Jonathon, Nova Scotia, 1985,” said the message.* 

If the bottle was launched in Nova Scotia, it traveled on the winds and currents over 6,000 across the Atlantic into the Mediterranean to the Adriatic Sea. No last names or addresses were given, so the identity of Jonathan & Mary remains a mystery.  If anyone knows who these two may be, please drop us a line. E-mail is preferred. Messages in bottle can take a while.  Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for passing the story along.

Clearly, Jonathon could have learned a thing or two from [Harold Hackett](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/09/the-original-social-networking-harold-hackett-and-his-messages-in-bottles/) on neighboring Prince Edward Island, who has launched 4,800 bottles into the sea since 1996 and has received 3,100 responses. Harold always put his full name and address in the bottles.  See our post from September 2011 – [The Original Social Networking – Harold Hackett and His Messages in Bottles](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/09/the-original-social-networking-harold-hackett-and-his-messages-in-bottles/).
