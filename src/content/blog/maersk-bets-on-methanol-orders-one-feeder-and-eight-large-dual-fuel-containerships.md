![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/02/maerskcarbonneutral.jpg)In February we [posted about an announcement](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2021/02/maersk-to-operate-first-carbon-neutral-containership-by-2023/) by [A.P. Moller-Maersk](https://www.maersk.com/about), the largest container ship operator in the world, [that it would launch the world’s first carbon-neutral cargo liner](https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2021/02/17/maersk-first-carbon-neutral-liner-vessel-by-2023) vessel in 2023 – seven years ahead of its initial 2030 target. Maersk’s first carbon-neutral ship will be a 2,000 TEU feeder vessel fueled by [methanol](https://www.methanol.org/renewable-methanol-companies/), operating on one of its intra-regional networks.

A little over a month ago, [A.P. Moller-Maersk doubled down on its strategy](https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2021/08/24/maersk-accelerates-fleet-decarbonisation) by ordering 8 large ocean-going container vessels capable of being operated on carbon-neutral methanol. The vessels will be built by Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) for delivery around 2024, and have a nominal capacity of approximately 16,000 TEU.  The agreement with HHI includes an option for 4 additional vessels in 2025.

Maersk says that the series will replace older vessels, generating annual CO2 emissions savings of around 1 million tonnes. As an industry first, the vessels will offer Maersk customers truly carbon-neutral transportation at scale on the high seas.

The vessels will be delivered with engines capable of operating on methanol as well as conventional low sulphur fuel. Maersk will operate the vessels on carbon-neutral e-methanol or sustainable bio-methanol as soon as possible but notes that sourcing an adequate amount of carbon-neutral methanol from day one in service will be challenging.  Sourcing the fuel will require a significant production ramp-up of proper carbon neutral methanol production, for which Maersk commits to continue to engage in partnerships and collaborations with relevant players.

Soren Skou, CEO, A.P. Moller – Maersk, is quoted as saying, “The time to act is now, if we are to solve shipping’s climate challenge. This order proves that carbon-neutral solutions are available today across container vessel segments and that Maersk stands committed to the growing number of our customers who look to decarbonize their supply chains. Further, this is a firm signal to fuel producers that sizable market demand for the green fuels of the future is emerging at speed.”
