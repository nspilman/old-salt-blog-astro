Thanks to Dexter Donham for pointing out this trailer for *[Vanishing Sail](http://www.vanishingsail.com/home.html)*, a documentary still under production and expected to be out in 2013.  Filmed in the Grenadines, *Vanishing Sail* looks at the sailing vessels that once were both the lifeblood of Caribbean commerce. From their [website](http://www.vanishingsail.com/home.html): *Mixed with rare archive footage and interviews with the last old Caribbean sea captains, the documentary combines dramatic sailing scenes with narration and an original soundtrack to tell the story of trading by sail in the West Indies and it’s legacy in the islands today.*
