![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/HoratioNelson1.jpg)Two hundred and fifty three years ago today, [Horatio Nelson](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nelson_admiral_horatio_lord.shtml) was born in in Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, the sixth of eleven children. He went to sea at 12 on a ship commanded by a maternal uncle.  He would become the greatest naval commander in British history, dying in 1805 at the battle of Trafalgar, his great victory, where the Royal Navy soundly defeated the combined fleets of the French and Spanish navies.

The [Royal New Zealand Navy](http://www.navy.mil.nz/) is also celebrating its 70th birthday.  On October 1, 1941, the  The New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy became the Royal New Zealand Navy.   The 70th Anniversary celebrations will include a visit to Wellington by ten navy ships. Festivities start today and run through Monday.  These will not be the only excitement in Wellington this weekend, however. The New Zealand All Blacks will be competing in a Rugby World Cup match against Canada. A  Festival of Carnivale  will also be taking place as will a “rural weekend” event  including sheep shearing, sheep dog trials, sheep racing and wood chopping.  Wow. A busy and eclectic weekend indeed.
