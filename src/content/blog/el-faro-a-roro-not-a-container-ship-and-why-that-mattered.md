*![elfaro3](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/elfaro3.jpg)[El Faro](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2015/10/roro-cargo-ship-el-faro-still-missing-with-33-crew-in-hurricane-joaquin/)* was often referred to in the media as a container ship. It is an easy mistake to make as the file photos showed her carrying stacks of containers on the main deck.  *El Faro, ex-Puerto Rico, ex-Northern* Lights, was built as a roll-on roll-off ship in 1975 at Sun Shipbuilding. She underwent several refurbishments and as she carried containers on deck, might have been called a ro-con. Nevertheless, below decks, she was designed to carry wheeled vehicles. When she sank she was carrying 391 containers topside and 294 cars, trucks and trailers below deck. Why is this important? Tragically, it may help explain what happened to the ship and her crew.

Roll-on roll-off ships, or ro/ros, can be extremely efficient vessels. According to IMO, in 2004, more than 1.3 billion passengers, 188 million cars, 856,000 buses and 28.7 million trailers were carried on 5.9 million crossings globally and non-passenger carrying ro/ros. On the other hand, ro/ros have an inherent weakness which might have doomed *El Faro*.

Ro/ros have wide vehicle decks. They are essentially parking lots at sea. The wide and open decks are necessary for efficiently driving vehicles on and off the ships. The problem is that even moderate flooding of the vehicle deck can dramatically destabilize a ro/ro.  The sloshing of the water on the vehicle deck, referred to as the “[free surface effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_surface_effect),” can cause the ship to capsize rapidly and without warning.

In 1987, when a bow door was left open on the passenger ro/ro ferry *[Herald of Free Enterprize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Herald_of_Free_Enterprise),* water on the vehicle deck caused the ship to capsize in 90 seconds, not long after leaving the dock. 193 passengers and crew were lost. In 1994, the passenger ro/ro *[Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Estonia)* capsized and sank with more than 900 lives lost when the bow door was torn off by heavy seas. In 2004, the ro/ro car carrier *[Baltic Ace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Baltic_Ace)* capsized and sank in 15 minutes following a collision with a container ship in the North Sea. Five crew were killed and six are missing and presumed dead. In 2006, a fire broke out on the Egyptian ro/ro passenger ferry *[al-Salam Boccaccio 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_al-Salam_Boccaccio_98).* Water from fighting the fire collected on the vehicle deck and caused the ship to capsize and sink with the loss of over 1,000 lives.

No one knows what happened to *El Faro* when she was caught in the path of Hurricane Joaquin.  Based on the fates of other ro/ro ships over the years, it is possible that flooding on *El Faro*‘s ro/ro decks may have caused a sudden capsize of the ship as it drifted, blacked out, near the eye of a Category 4 hurricane.
