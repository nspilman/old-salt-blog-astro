![orelfire](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/04/orelfire.jpg)A [fire broke out today](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11519646/Russian-nuclear-submarine-catches-fire-at-shipyard.html) on the 23 year old Russian Oscar class K-266 [*Orel* nuclear submarine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_submarine_Orel_\(K-266\)) in a drydock in the Zvezdochka shipyard in Severodvinsk on the White Sea. Reportedly, a welding torch set insulation on fire. The shipyard has stated that the submarine’s reactor was shut down and the ship’s nuclear fuel had been removed prior to the accident. A spokesman for the shipyard said that there were no casualties and that firefighters had contained the blaze.

Coincidentally, the fire today occurred on the 26th anniversary of the a fire on the [Mike-class Soviet nuclear submarine K-278 *Komsomolets*.](http://www.wdam.com/story/28737929/on-this-day-in-history-april-7th-1989) which claimed the lives of all 42 crew aboard on April 7, 1989.  The *Komsomolets* and her nuclear reactor and nuclear torpedoes still rest on the floor of the Norwegian Sea in 5,510 feet of water.

The *Komsomolets* tragedy was not the worst Russian submarine tragedy. In 2000, the Russian nuclear submarine [*Kursk*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_submarine_Kursk_\(K-141\)) suffered a torpedo explosion and sank with all 118 hands. The *Kursk* happened to be an Oscar class nuclear submarine, similar to the *Orel* which caught fire today. Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/) for contributing to this post.
