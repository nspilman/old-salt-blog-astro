![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/04/glorianna1.jpg)This has been a busy day for Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. They braved heavy rain and driving winds to name the *Gloriana*, a new 94-foot ornately carved royal barge, decorated with gold leaf. The *Gloriana* is the first royal barge to have been built in 100 years. The barge will lead the Jubilee pageant on June 3rd.

The Queen also officially reopened the *Cutty Sark* in Greenwich five years after it was ravaged by fire. The Queen originally opened the 19th Century tea clipper exhibit in 1957. The Queen’s trip to Greenwich also also included [a visit to the newly exhibited stern carving of the *Royal Charles*](http://www.dutchembassyuk.org/page/index.php?i=727) – taken from the Medway during the Anglo Dutch wars.   Videos of the events after the jump.
