Retiree Edd Hale writes in the [Pittsburgh Post Gazette](http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/opinion/perspectives/the-next-page-aboard-the-us-brig-niagara-armchair-sailor-no-more-676680/?fb_comment_id=fbc_157268227761778_409489_160568550765079#f231d5a6b8) about surrendering his status as an armchair sailor to sail the Great Lakes in the [Brig Niagara](http://www.eriemaritimemuseum.org/maritime_museum/Exhibits/US_Brig_Niagara.htm), a replica of the Master Commandant [Oliver Hazard Perry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Hazard_Perry)‘s flagship on which he won the [Battle of Lake Erie](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/09/the-two-most-important-naval-victories-of-the-war-of-1812-part-1-battle-of-lake-erie/), one of the most important naval battles in the War of 1812.

Edd writes:  *My childhood dreams of sailing in tall ships were pretty much unknown to my parents and friends. After all, tall ships were something from a time long, long ago and sailing on them seemed only a boy’s fantasy. But above my bed were several small prints of sailing ships, and I once built a huge model of the clipper ship Cutty Sark. I did tell people from time to time that had I been born in the last century (which at that time meant the 19th century), I probably would have gone to sea.*

*Instead, I became a history teacher and spent most of my 35-year career in the eighth grade, where my curriculum included the golden age of exploration and sail. My students heard about ships and navigation and great voyages of discovery — all from a teacher who had never set foot on a sailing ship. I was the quintessential armchair sailor.*
