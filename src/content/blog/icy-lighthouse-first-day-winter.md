Icy images on the first day of winter — the [St. Joseph inner and outer lighthouses](https://www.facebook.com/StJosephLighthouse/) sit on a pier at the entrance to the St. Joseph River on Lake Michigan. The two lights were built in 1906 and 1907 and were decommissioned in 2005. The outer light is famous for the coating of ice it acquires in winter storms. Here is a drone video of the two lights.  Thanks to Irwin Bryan for passing the video along.
