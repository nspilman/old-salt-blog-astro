*The Becky Thatcher had a long and lustrous history. Built in 1926 in Jefferson, Ind., as The Mississippi (III) by the Army Corps of Engineers, the stern-wheeler originally was used for inspecting and surveying rivers. Despite being a workboat, it was outfitted with comfortable accommodations for 65 passengers.*

*The boat was retired in 1961 and in 1963 was sold to Mark Twain Enterprises, which set it up as a restaurant and museum in Hannibal, Mo. In the late 1960s, it was towed to St. Louis, where it was renamed the Becky Thatcher and extensively restored.*

*In the years that followed, the boat was used as a floating dinner theater and a bar and restaurant. In 1975, it was purchased by a group of citizens in Marietta as part of that town’s bicentennial celebration. Moored along Front Street on the Muskingum River, the first production performed aboard it by the Mid-Ohio Valley Players in 1976 was “Showboat.”*

*The National Park Service entered the boat into the National Register of Historic Places in October 1983.*
