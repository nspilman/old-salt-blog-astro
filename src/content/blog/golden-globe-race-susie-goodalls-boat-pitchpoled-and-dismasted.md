![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/12/susiegoodall.jpg)British sailor [Susie Goodall](https://goldengloberace.com/skipper/susie-goodall/)‘s Rustler 36 yacht, *DHL Starlight*, is reported to have been pitchpoled and been dismasted in the Southern Ocean, approximately 2,000 miles west of Cape Horn. Goodall was racing in the Golden Globe single-handed around the world race and was knocked unconscious when the boat rolled end over end. When she came to, she activated her EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Beacon) and sent the following message to race officials:*DISMASTED. HULL OK. NO FORM OF JURY RIG, TOTAL LOSS Position: 45′ 27.787 S 122′ 23.537 W.*

Race officials report that they reached Goodall by satellite phone and she said: *“I have been dismasted. Thought I had holed the hull because the boat filled with water, but the hull is NOT holed. The hull is OK.*

*The boat is destroyed. I can’t make up a jury rig. The only thing left is the hull and deck which remain intact.*

*We were pitchpoled \[rolled end over end\] and I was thrown across the cabin and knocked out for a while.”*

They also report: *Speaking with emotion, but sounding very much in control of her situation, Susie also confirmed that she had secured all hatches, portholes and safety equipment, and did NOT need immediate assistance. She said that before the incident, she had been enjoying the conditions and felt in control. But then the safety tube on her Monitor self-steering broke and she was forced to trail a drogue anchor astern and take down the mainsail. She was below decks when the boat was pitchpoled, and when she returned on deck to assess the damage, found that the line attached to the drogue had parted.*

*Susie also reported that she ‘has been beaten up and badly bruised’ with cuts and scratches and a big bump on her head. MSOS, the GGR’s 24-hour medical telecentre has been advised and doctors are now monitoring her symptoms and providing direct medical advice.*

*Chilean Authorities have contacted a ship 480 miles SW of Goodall‘s position and requested assistance. Her Captain expects to take 2 days to reach the area.*

The ship is reported to be the bulk carrier MV *Tian Fu.* 

At least five boats, including Goodall’s, were forced to withdraw from the race due to problems related to wind vane self-steering gear failures. Eleven sailors withdrew from the race or have required rescue. Five boats, so far, have been dismasted. Seven sailors are continuing in the race.

Susie Goodall is the youngest competitor and the only woman in the race. Before being dismasted, she was in 4th place.
