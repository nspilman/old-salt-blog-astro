![meerwald-(1)](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/meerwald-1.jpg)I wish that I had been sent to a summer camp aboard a historic schooner when I was a kid. Growing up in Texas, I remember summer camps notable for scrub mesquite trees, cactus and snakes, only some of which were poisonous.  But I digress. This summer the 1928 Delaware Bay Oyster Schooner, [*AJ Meerwald*](http://bayshorecenter.org/a-j-meerwald/)  will be offering a variety of sailing camp programs for children between the ages of 10 and 17.  These programs range from one-day “Sailor For A Day Camp” to 5-day, 4-night shipboard experiences in their “Maritime Camp.” [Click here to learn more](http://bayshorecenter.org/a-j-meerwald/go-sailing/sail-types/camps-adventures/kids/).
