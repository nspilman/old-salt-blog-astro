![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/featuredimageseal1.jpg)My wife and I took an incredible trip to the Galapagos in 2017. An updated repost.  We spent a week on [Ecoventura](http://www.ecoventura.com/)‘s 83’ [MY *Eric*](http://www.ecoventura.com/galapagos-yachts/) and visited six of the more eastern islands of the archipelago. We saw many of the species of plants and animals that helped [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) formulate his theory of evolution as described in his “[*On the Origin of the Species*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species)” of 1859. One of our favorites were the nearly ubiquitous sea lions which we snorkeled with almost every day.

Shortly after we started snorkeling off the beach at Punta Pitt on San Cristobal, on our first full day in the Galapagos, several sea lion pups swam over to play.  We were barely in waist deep water before two pups began literally swimming circles around us. The short video we shot is below. 

Later in the trip, we would see the majestic albatross. The old legend claims that the albatross carries the souls of lost sailors. Given my choice, I would prefer to come back as a sea lion. They do certainly seem to have fun.
