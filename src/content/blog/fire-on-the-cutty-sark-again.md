![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/nanniedee.jpg)There are reports of a “small fire” aboard the 19th-century composite clipper ship, [*Cutty Sark*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark), in Greenwich, UK.  Firefighters managed to contain the blaze which is said to have damaged a small part of deck three and associated timbers.  The Cutty Sark Crew, who runs the ship, said on Twitter: *“London Fire Brigade dealt with a small fire on the ship this morning. Brought under control very quickly. The ship will open at 10.30am today*.”  The fire was reported at 7:30 AM and four engines with 21 firefighters responded.

In 2007, the [*Cutty Sark* was almost destroyed when a fire](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-595792/Cutty-Sark-destroyed-fire.html) burned close to 50% of the ship. She has since been restored and reopened to the public on 25 April 2012.  One of the fastest ships of its day, the *Cutty Sark* was launched in 1869.  She is one of only two surviving composite clipper ships.
