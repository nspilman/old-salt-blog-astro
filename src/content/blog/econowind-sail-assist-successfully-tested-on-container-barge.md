![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/econowindbarge.jpg)A year ago we [posted about the innovative ideas and products](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/10/econowind-modular-sail-assist-thinking-inside-the-box/) developed by the Dutch firm, [eConowind](https://www.econowind.nl/). They have developed a Ventfoil, a fixed airfoil-shaped spar with an internal fan that uses boundary layer suction to generate thrust.  Ventfoils can be installed to provide sail-assisted propulsion on new ships, or [retrofitted on existing vessels](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/ventifoil-wind-assist/). There is also a modular version in which two Ventfoils can be deployed from inside a 40-foot container. The Ventfoils can be raised or lowered from the container in about 5 minutes.

Recently, an [eCononwind Ventfoil container was installed on the TMA Logistics container barge](https://www.portofamsterdam.com/en/news/container-barges-have-wind-their-sails) *Ms. Royaal*, operating on the IJsselmeer and the Wadden Sea, between Harlingen and Amsterdam. The conditions were close to perfect. The route is typically very windy. That being said, the single eConowind container sail unit produced fuel savings of 10%, enough to justify further testing.
