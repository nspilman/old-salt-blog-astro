Blue whales are the largest animal ever to live on earth and are also highly endangered with an estimated population of only 10,000 compared to over half a million a few decades ago.   A second season of plentiful krill seems to have lured the whales in the bay.    Whale watchers also saw a pod of 30-35 humpback whales feeding in the bay as well.
