![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/vka-socrates-6440-jpg.jpg)On May 18th, [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/05/jeanne-socrates-singlehanding-at-76-suffers-knockdown-off-new-zealand/) that singlehander [Jeanne Socrates](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/01/jeanne-socrates-singlehanding-non-stop-around-the-world-at-76/), 76, on her fourth circumnavigation, suffered a knockdown on S/V Nereida off the South Island of New Zealand. Despite the loss of solar panels and damage to the wind generator system, Socrates was unhurt, and sails, rig, most instruments, autopilot, and radio were undamaged.

Socrates is attempting to become the oldest person to sail solo around the world non-stop and unassisted. After the knockdown, most would have given up and put into port, but Jeanne has not abandoned her quest. She has put into Timaru Harbour, South Island, New Zealand to make necessary repairs to her Najad 380, *Nerieda*. As long as she does not go ashore or receive support or supplies, she can continue on her voyage “non-stop and unassisted.”

[Yachting Monthly](https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/jeanne-socrates-oldest-person-sail-around-world-solo-nonstop-unassisted-record-attempt-70288) reports that the knockdown left her without wind or solar charging capabilities; the yacht’s solar panels were washed away. She has since repaired her wind generator.

‘I had a set of blades on board so perched up on the top of my stern arch and removed and replaced the broken blade – all working fine now, thank God,’ she said. ‘ The loss of solar power is a big blow, but I have enough diesel to run the generator to charge the batteries. I’m hoping to run the autopilot all the way back and can always hand steer partly as well.’

Despite chilly conditions, she is repairing sails, lifelines and charging batteries. According to her most recent blog post, she hopes to get underway today or Monday, depending on wind and weather. 

We wish her only the best. Her determination and stamina is an inspiration to us all.
