Enchantment of the Seas

Two news stories recently on drugs aboard cruise ships suggest two very different types of drug problems.   U.S. Customs and Border Protection raided the *[MSC Poesia](http://www.msccruisesusa.com/us_en/Ships/MSC-Poesia.aspx),* on Jan. 4, prior to the ship departing on a “[Jam Cruise](http://www.jamcruise.com/2011/home)” a floating music festival  featuring 44 performers and bands.  As reported by [NBC Miami](http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local-beat/Popular-Jam-Cruise-Ship-Raided-by-Fed-113132159.html): “*The raids resulted in 15 seizures of LSD, marijuana, mushrooms, hash oil, prescription drugs, Ecstasy, and drug paraphernalia, all in mostly small quantities*.”  
  
While these Feds were busting recreational users, drug-sniffing dogs found nearly $100,000 worth of cocaine and heroin aboard the Royal Caribbean cruise ship, *[Enchantment of the Seas](http://www.royalcaribbean.com/findacruise/ships/class/ship/home.do?shipCode=EN)*, in Baltimore in [a federal investigation of an employee smuggling ring](http://www.cruiselawnews.com/2010/12/articles/crime/cruise-crime-three-crew-drug-arrests-and-a-closed-passenger-overboard-investigation/).   As noted by [Jim Walker of Cruise Law News](http://www.cruiselawnews.com/2011/01/articles/drugs/drug-bust-on-msc-poesia-cruise-ship/) “*The real problem with drugs on cruise ships is when crime cartels use cruise ships to smuggle large quantities of cocaine and heroin.*”  Earlier this week, the UK Border Agency and Serious Organised Crime Agency issued a warning about drug gangs using cruise ships to smuggle “multi-kilo loads” of drugs.    [Drug gangs target cruise ships](http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/captain-greybeard/2011/01/d.html)

Thanks to Irwin Bryan for passing along the article about the Jam Cruise bust.
