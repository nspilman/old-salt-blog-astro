*The blast was probably caused by a spark from welding operations although police were not ruling out any possibility including that of an attack, Chief Minister Peter Caruana told Radio Gibraltar.*

*Flames several metres high could be seen coming out of the tank, which contained diesel to refuel ships, with dense black smoke billowing across the port as firefighters directed jets of water at the blaze from tugboats.*

*The tank was close to the giant cruise ship Independence of the Seas which had arrived in Gibraltar Tuesday morning.*

*The ship made an emergency departure immediately after the blast Tuesday afternoon and no injuries or damage were reported on the vessel.*

*“The lid of the tank was blown off by the blast,” a police spokesman said. “Two people were injured, one very seriously.”*
