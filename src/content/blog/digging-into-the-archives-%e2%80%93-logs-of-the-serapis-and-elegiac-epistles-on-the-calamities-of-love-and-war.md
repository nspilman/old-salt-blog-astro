![BonhommeRichard](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BonhommeRichard.jpg)In honor of John Paul Jones’ victory in the Battle of Flamborough Head where he captured HMS Serapis on this day 230 years ago, we offer two works from the archives. (For those who have not yet discovered it, the [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/index.php) is a wonderful resource.)

The first is:

[The logs of the Serapis–Alliance–Ariel, under the command of John Paul Jones, 1779-1780, with extracts from public documents, unpublished letters, and narratives, and illustrated with reproductions of scarce prints (1911)](http://www.archive.org/details/logsofserspins00barnrich)  
  
The logs feature accounts of the battle and its aftermath.

We also offer a more literary selection:

[Elegiac epistles on the calamities of love and war, including a genuine description of the tragical engagement between His Majesty’s ships the Serapis and Countess of Scarborough, and the enemy’s squadron under the command of Paul Jones, on the twenty-third of September, 1779.](http://www.archive.org/details/elegiacepistles00jonerich)

They just don’t write titles like they use to.  Thank goodness.
