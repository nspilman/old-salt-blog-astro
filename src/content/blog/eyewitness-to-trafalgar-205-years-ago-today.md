A letter which only recently resurfaced gives an ordinary seaman’s view of the famous battle which was fought 205 years ago today.

[‘They won’t send their fleets out again in a hurry’: Remarkable letter from hero who survived the Battle of Trafalgar](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1322144/Eyewitness-account-Battle-Trafalgar-emerges-205-years.html)  
  
*His ship safely home from the Battle of Trafalgar, sailor Robert Hope was brimming with pride.*

*‘What do you think of us lads of the sea now? I think they won’t send their fleets out again in a hurry,’ he wrote in a letter to his brother about the victory over the French and Spanish.*

*Hope, a sailmaker, was part of the crew of the gunship HMS Temeraire, which went to the aid of Admiral Lord Nelson’s flagship HMS Victory at the height of the fighting.*

*Yesterday Quintin Colville, curator of naval history at the National Maritime Museum, which has purchased the letter from Hope’s descendants for an undisclosed sum, said: ‘There are numerous accounts of Trafalgar written by officers but this is a very rare example of a voice from the lower decks.’*

*Hope wrote the letter to his brother John, a carpenter, from Ashford, Kent, a fortnight after the battle while his ship was moored at Portsmouth.*

*He gives a vivid account of the conflict, telling how his 98-gun ship engaged the Santisima Trinadada, a Spanish four-decker, for 45 minutes alongside Nelson’s Victory before they came under heavy attack.*
