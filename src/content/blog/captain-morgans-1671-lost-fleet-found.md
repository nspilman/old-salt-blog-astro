![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/rszcaptmorganchrisbickfordh.jpg)This is an interesting story for several reasons. First, archaeologists believe that they may have discovered the wreckage of a 17th century ship lost off the coast of Panama in 1671, from the famed [Captain Henry Morgan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgan)‘s fleet.   Second, a fact buried in the article, the expedition is being funded by [Captain Morgan Rum](http://www.captainmorgan.com/).   Now, I can drink rum and support underwater archaeology at the same time.

*Archaeologists have discovered the wreckage of a 17th century ship they believe to be from the famed Captain Henry Morgan’s fleet, lost off the coast of Panama in 1671.*

*The shipwreck was found on the Lajas Reef at the mouth of the Chagres River. The wreck is believed to be one of the boats lost as Morgan stormed Panama City in an attempt to take the Castillo de San Lorenzo, a Spanish fort on the cliff overlooking the entrance to the Chagres River, the only water passageway between the Caribbean and the capital city. Although his men ultimately prevailed, Morgan lost five ships to the rough seas and shallow reef surrounding the fort.*
