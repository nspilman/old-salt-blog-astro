![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/01/Zografia.jpg)Houthi anti-ship missiles struck two more commercial ships in the Red Sea off Yemen in the last two days. There were no reports of injuries on either ship.

On Tuesday, the Greek-owned 57,000 DWT bulk carrier [MT *Zografia*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:284247/mmsi:248185000/imo:9486013/vessel:ZOGRAFIA) with 24 crew was sailing in ballast from Vietnam to Israel when it was struck by a missile. It is said to have suffered only minor damage.

The day before, US Central Command (CENTCOM) issued a [statement](https://twitter.com/CENTCOM/status/1746913313932685597?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet): *On Jan. 15 at approximately 4 p.m. (Sanaa time), Iranian-backed Houthi militants fired an anti-ship ballistic missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and struck the M/V Gibraltar Eagle, a Marshall Islands-flagged, U.S.-owned and operated container ship. The ship has reported no injuries or significant damage and is continuing its journey.*

(Despite the CENTCOM characterization of the ship as a container ship, the [M/V *Gibraltar Eagle*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:2893718/mmsi:538006171/imo:9702508/vessel:GIBRALTAR_EAGLE) is a 64,000 DWT bulk carrier.)

On Sunday, US Navy jets were reported to have shot down a missile fired towards the destroyer USS *Laboon* from a Houthi area of Yemen.

The US continued air strikes against missile, drone, and logistical targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.  Four anti-ship ballistic missiles that were ready to be launched were destroyed, an official told CBS, the [BBC’](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67992600)s American partner.

The US and UK launched a wave of airstrikes against dozens of Houthi targets on January 11, following attacks by the group on shipping in the Red Sea.
