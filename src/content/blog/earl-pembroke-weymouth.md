![earlofp1s](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/earlofp1s.jpg)One celebrity at Weymouth during the [Weymouth Leviathan](http://weymouthleviathan.org.uk/) was the tall ship *[Earl of Pembroke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Pembroke_\(tall_ship\))*.  The barque has been featured in seventeen movies of TV shows. Unfortunately, like so many other movie stars, the ship was not accessible, behind locked gates and high fences. Nevertheless, I could get a good look at the ship from the other side of the river.

*Earl of Pembroke* started out in 1945 as *Orion,* a Baltic lumber schooners.  She carried lumber until 1974.  The ship was restored on in 1985 when the rig was changed from the original fore and aft schooner rig to her current barque rig.  She was renamed *Earl of Pembroke*, which was the original name of HMS *Endeavour*. *Earl of Pembroke* is now owned by Metaco LLP.
