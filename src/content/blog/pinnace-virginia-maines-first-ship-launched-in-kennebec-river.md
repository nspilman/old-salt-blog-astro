Twenty-seven years ago, a plan was conceived to reconstruct Maine’s first ship, [*Virginia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_\(pinnace\)), built by in 1607 by settlers of the Popham Colony at the mouth of the Kennebec River. The original 51′ pinnace was the first English ocean-going ship built in the Americas. After considerable research, the keel of the reconstruction was laid in 2011.

On Saturday, June 4th, after over a decade of fabrication by more than 200 volunteers, the new incarnation of *Virginia* was christened and gently lowered into the waters of the Kennebec River by twin cranes, as hundreds joined in a day-long celebration along the shore in Bath, Maine.

The [Portland Press Herald](https://www.pressherald.com/2022/06/05/bath-group-launches-replica-of-400-plus-year-old-ship-after-decades-of-work/) reports that the day’s festivities started at noon with the firing of Virginia’s cannons. A street fair, which featured musical performances, historical reenactors, a craft fair, and food vendors, entertained visitors until the launch ceremony.

Cheers and applause from the crowd joined the sound of the ship’s guns firing as the cranes lowered the *Virginia* into the Kennebec River.

Now that the vessel is in the water, crews will need to finish the pinnace’s rigging and get the vessel certified by the Coast Guard before it can set sail. [Maine’s First Ship](https://mfship.org/) Executive Director, Kirstie Truluck estimates that the *Virginia* could be completed in summer 2023.
