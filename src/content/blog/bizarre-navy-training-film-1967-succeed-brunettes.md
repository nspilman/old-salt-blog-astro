This may be the most bizarre Navy training film yet. The film dates from 1967 and purports to answer the question of “how to succeed with brunettes (or blondes.)” It is directed exclusively at male naval officers.

How many female naval officers were there in 1967? Some, but not too many. The first woman to become an admiral in the US Navy was [Alene Duerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alene_Duerk) in 1972. Admiral Duerk was the head of the Navy Nurse Corps.

As for the answer to the question, “how to succeed with brunettes (or blondes?” the film recommends acting like a “gentleman,” which is not altogether bad advice, in general, although considerably less condescension and general sexism might be in order.
