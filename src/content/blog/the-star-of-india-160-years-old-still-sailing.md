Built and launched in 1863 by Ramsey Shipyard in the Isle of Man and originally named *Euterpe*, San Diego’s iconic *Star of India* is said to be the world’s oldest active sailing ship and has circumnavigated the globe twenty-one times. Star of India first came to the City of San Diego in 1927. It was not until 1951 when Maritime Museum of San Diego made long-awaited historical renovations to the vessel originally named *Euterpe*, after the Greek goddess of music and poetry. *Star of India* relies on Maritime Museum of San Diego volunteers and a committed staff for her upkeep.
