![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wodeckercrop.jpg)The [*W.O. Decker*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._O._Decker), the last wooden tug in New York harbor, is back at work. The 52′ tug, built in 1930 in Long Island City, is now offering harbor tours from the South Street Seaport on New York’s East River. After more than a decade of restoration, the *W.O. Decker* is giving visitors a sea-level perspective on New York’s maritime history. 

The tours are now offered on Saturdays and Sundays, although the [South Street Seaport Museum](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/) is working to expand the tours to weekdays as well.  The hour-long tour costs $30 and reservations are required. For more information, [click here](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/visit-/street-of-ships/w-o-decker/).

The video below describes the *W.O. Decker* as a ‘steam tugboat.’ While originally powered by steam, she has been re-engined with a 285 hp horsepower diesel.

The South Street Seaport Museum also offers harbor sails on the 1885 schooner *[Pioneer](https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/visit/street-of-ships/pioneer/)*.
