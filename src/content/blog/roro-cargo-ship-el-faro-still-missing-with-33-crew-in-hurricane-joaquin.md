The US Coast Guard has resumed the search for the U.S. flagged ro/ro cargo ship, *[El Faro](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/vessel/?id=93148DA65C3C681D)*, with a crew of 33, still missing after losing power and communications in the path of Hurricane Joaquin. The 735-foot ship was bound for San Juan in Puerto Rico from Jacksonville, Florida. [TOTE Maritime lost contact with the ship](http://www.scribd.com/doc/283453121/TOTE-Maritime-Puerto-Rico-Status-Update-El-Faro-3) on Thursday at 7:20 AM EST and notified the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard reported that at approximately 7:30 AM Thursday, the Coast Guard Atlantic Area command center in Portsmouth, Virginia, received an Inmarsat satellite notification stating that *El Faro* was beset by Hurricane Joaquin, had lost propulsion and had a 15-degree list. The Coast Guard reported that the ship was believed to be near the worst of the Category 4 hurricane, in up to 150 mph gusts and 30-foot waves.

On Friday, the U.S. Coast Guard dispatched a [cutter, an MH-60 Jayhawk rescue helicopter and two C-130 Hercules airplan](http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/02/us/hurricane-joaquin/)es but failed to locate the ship. The Coast Guard covered approximately 850 square nautical miles in the search on Friday. Search and rescue crews are now searching for the ship near Crooked Island in the Bahamas.
