![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pinkdolphin.jpg)On Sunday, the [*Pink Dolphin*, a 223-ton high-speed ferry](https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-ferry-rescue/4315152.html) loaded with 158 passengers and five crew, ran up on rocks while operating in fog, near the port of Mokpo on the southwest coast of Korea, 400 km south of Seoul. The captain reported that he was maneuvering to avoid a fishing boat when the ferry hit the rocks. The 163 aboard were rescued by the South Korean Coast Guard. Six minor injuries were reported. 

The grounding took place not far from where the [passenger ferry Sewol sank](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/04/south-korean-ferry-tragedy-close-to-300-missing-as-ferry-sewol-sinks/) in April of 2014 with the loss of over 300, many of whom were high school students on a field trip.
