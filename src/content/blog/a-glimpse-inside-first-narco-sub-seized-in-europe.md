![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/narcosub1.jpg)In late 2019, [we posted](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/12/spain-busts-first-known-trans-atlantic-narco-sub/) about [Spanish authorities seizing a narco sub](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a30085631/spain-narcosub/) loaded with 3 tonnes of cocaine, valued at $110 million, off the northwestern coast of Galicia. Narco subs have been caught operating in the Pacific and in the Gulf of Mexico for several years. The vessel seized by Spain is believed to be the first narco sub apprehended after crossing the Atlantic Ocean from South America to Europe.

Last month, another sub was discovered off the Spanish coast – again in the Galicia region.

In the video below [Nick Beake, reporting for the BBC,](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65337215) provides a glimpse inside the first narco sub seized off Spain, which is now a trophy in the car park of the Spanish police academy in Ávila.
