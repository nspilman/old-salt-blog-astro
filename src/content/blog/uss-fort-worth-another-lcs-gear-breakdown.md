![ussfortworth](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ussfortworth.jpg)The sad saga of the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) continues. The *[USS Fort Worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fort_Worth_\(LCS-3\)),* the third [*Freedom* Class LCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom-class_littoral_combat_ship) delivered, was testing its engines at dockside in Singapore and [seriously damaged the ship’s combining gear](http://news.usni.org/2016/01/21/littoral-combat-ship-uss-fort-worth-sidelined-in-singapore-with-propulsion-system-damage). The LCS have both diesel and gas turbine engines. The combining gear is a complex set of gears which “combines” the output from the ship’s Rolls Royce MT-30 gas turbines and Colt-Pielstick diesel engines to the ship’s water jets. Initial reports say that the casualty was caused by the crew allowing the gear to run dry [without adequate lubrication](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-21/u-s-navy-littoral-ship-sidelined-in-singapore-after-gear-damage), leading to overheating. Whether the casualty was indeed due to operator error or a class-wide problem remains to be seen.

This is not the first combining gear casualty with a *Freedom* Class LCS. In December, the [USS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Milwaukee_\(LCS-5\)) *[Milwaukee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Milwaukee_\(LCS-5\)),* the second ship of the class*,* which had been delivered from the shipyard only the month before, had a combining gear failure while in the Atlantic on its way to a deployment in San Diego. The [ship was towed to a Navy base](http://wavy.com/2015/12/12/uss-milwaukee-breaks-down-is-towed-to-base-in-virginia/) in Virginia for [repairs, which are expected to take until February.](http://news.usni.org/2015/12/23/littoral-combat-ship-uss-milwaukee-repairs-estimated-to-extend-into-february) The casualty has been blamed on slipping clutches which may have been caused by a software error. The clutch slippage caused fine metallic debris to clog and cut off the lube system on the gear. As reported by [USNI News](http://news.usni.org/2016/01/11/lockheed-martin-navy-have-not-determined-if-failure-that-sidelined-uss-milwaukee-is-a-class-wide-issue), Lockheed Martin and the Navy have still not determined if the failure on the USS *Milwaukee* is a class-wide issue.

The USS *Fort Worth* is also not the first LCS to break down in Singapore.  On a deployment  in 2013, [USS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Freedom_\(LCS-1\)) *[Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Freedom_\(LCS-1\)),* the first of the class, broke down three times on the way to Singapore then suffered repeated mechanical failures [forcing the cutting short of several planned exercises](http://aviationweek.com/defense/uss-freedom-cuts-short-initial-singapore-underway).  [A GAO report from July of 2014](http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665114.pdf) notes that changes have been made to the *Freedom*‘s starboard splitter gear and port combining gear to “*improve maintainability on LCS 1 \[USS Freedom\] and 3 \[USS Milwaukee.\] The design will be changed* *on LCS 5 \[USS Fort Worth\] and follow-on ships to further improve maintainability.”*
