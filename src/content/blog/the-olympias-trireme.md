The performance of the *Olympias* has been impressive. In trails in 1987 the trireme achieved a cruising speed up to 6 knots when rowed continuously for 30 miles, with an average of 5 knots. It reached 9 knots in sprints, and sailed at 10.8 knots under sail with a following wind.

In the late 1987,  John Coates,  John Morrison and N. B. Rankov wrote [The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521564565?ie=UTF8&tag=tholsabl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0521564565) describing their research, the design construction and testing of the *Olympias.* The second addition of the book, published in 2000, reports on what was learned in fifteen years of testing and training with the ancient craft.
