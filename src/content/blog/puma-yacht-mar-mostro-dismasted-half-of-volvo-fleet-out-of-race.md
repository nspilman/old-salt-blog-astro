![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/11/6379366539_16d7582096_z.jpg)Havoc continues in the [Volvo Ocean Race](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/home.html), an around-the-world race which bills itself as ” the world’s toughest sailing event.”  Three of the six boats to attempt the first leg of the race have withdrawn.  [Two of the six boat fleet withdrew from the race within 24 hours of the start](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/11/06/volvo-ocean-race-off-to-rough-start-two-of-six-boats-damaged-in-first-24-hours/)  after suffering rigging failure or hull damage.  Now, only 17 days into the nine month race, the [Puma yacht *Mar Mostro,* was dismasted](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/more-sports/volvo-ocean-race-decimated-with-american-yacht-puma-dismasted-during-opening-leg-to-cape-town/story-e6frey6i-1226202405317)  and has withdrawn from the first leg of the competition.  The yacht was roughly 2,300 miles from Cape Town, South Africa, the finish line for the first leg of the race, when its mast went over the side in winds above 20 knots and high seas.  There were no reported injuries to the crew of eleven.  Sails have been set on the remaining 15′ mast stub and the boat is now sailing for the island of Tristan de Cuhna.  
  
The remaining yachts in the first leg of the race are *Telefonica*, skippered by former Spanish Olympian Iker Martinez, which now leads the race; followed by the New Zealand yacht *Camper*, captained by Australian Chris Nicholson; and the French yacht *Groupama 4,* skippered by Franck Cammas. There has been drama aboard these boats as well. Recently *Camper’*s bowman Mike Pammenter suffered a broken tooth and gash to the face after being thrown into the boat’s shrouds during a sail change.

It is likely that the fleet will re-form in Cape Town.   [Team Sanya](http://www.teamsanya.com/)*‘s* boat, which  withdrew from the race after suffering hull damage a few hours after the start of the race, is now traveling as cargo on a container ship toward Cape Town, where [a new bow is being fabricated to replace the damaged bow section](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/Sanya-prepare-for-critical-repair-work/4102/news.html). The Abu Dhabi team’s  *Azzam,* which withdrew after a mast failure in the early hours of the race is also on her way by ship to South Africa. The [Puma team has also announced that they expect to rejoin the race.](http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/PUMA-will-live-to-fight-another-day-says-Read/4125/news.html)
