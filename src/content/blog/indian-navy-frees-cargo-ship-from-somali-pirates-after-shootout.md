![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/somalihijack.jpg)The [Voice of America](https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-navy-frees-cargo-ship-from-somali-pirates-after-shootout/7530557.html) reports that the Indian navy freed the hijacked [MV *Ruen*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:6312030/mmsi:249517000/imo:9754903/vessel:RUEN) cargo ship in Somalia’s Puntland region Saturday after a 24-hour standoff and shootout, and it has detained 35 pirates, according to Puntland Ports Minister Ahmed Yasin Salah. The crew is reported to be unharmed.

The pirates — who allegedly hijacked the Maltese-flagged bulk cargo vessel on December 14 — exchanged heavy gunfire with the Indian navy Friday.

“The Indian navy successfully conducted the operation, which has been going on since last night. The navy captured 35 pirates and released the MV *Ruen* ship, and its crew are safe,” Salah said.

“We received the information regarding the gunfight Friday afternoon. Once we followed up with our reliable sources, we were told that the Indian navy engaged in a gunfight with the Somali pirates.”

In an interview with VOA Somali, Salah said the pirates on the *Ruen* had been sailing back and forth across the Somali coast for months, and that the Indians intercepted them Friday, as they approached another pirate-held ship the MV *Abdullah*.

It was not immediately clear if the Somali pirates were using the hijacked ship MV *Ruen* to take over the Bangladesh-flagged cargo ship, MV *Abdullah*.

The MV *Abdullah* was sailing from Mozambique’s capital Maputo to the United Arab Emirates with a cargo of 55,000 tons of coal when Somali pirates attacked and seized it on the evening of March 12, taking 23 of its crew members hostage.

Quoting an Indian navy spokesperson, Reuters reported Saturday that the Somali pirates opened fire on the Indian navy ship in international waters Friday.

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/somali-forces-foreign-navies-prepare-attack-hijacked-ship-police-say-2024-03-18/) also reports that Somali police and international navies are preparing to mount a rescue of the MV *Abdullah* that was hijacked by pirates last week, the Puntland region’s police force said, two days after Indian commandos rescued MV *Ruen* held by pirates.
