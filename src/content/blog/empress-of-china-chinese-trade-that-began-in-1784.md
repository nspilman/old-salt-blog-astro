![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/empress-of-china.jpg)Given all the economic damage being done by needless trade wars, it seems worthwhile to recall the ship that opened the trade with the United States’ first trading partner, China. The new nation had won the Revolutionary War but had lost much of its foreign trade. The economy slumped. The American banker Robert Morris decided to venture into new markets. If the British wouldn’t sell Americans tea from India, then Americans would buy tea from China. He hired a newly built privateer, renamed the ship the *[Empress of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_of_China_\(1783\)),* and outfitted her for commerce. 

On February 22, 1784, Washington’s birthday and just over a month after Congress ratified the peace treaty, the *Empress of China* sailed from New York harbor bound for Canton. The *Empress* carried [cargoes worth $120,000](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1750_us.htm) including lead, 2,600 animal skins, fine camel cloth, cotton, Spanish silver coins, and a few barrels of pepper. The ship also carried 30 tons of ginseng, a root that grew wild in North America and was considered by the Chinese to have healing properties.

The *Empress* returned to New York on May 11, 1785, after a round voyage of 14 months and 24 days.  She carried a return cargo of 800 chests of tea, 20,000 pairs of nankeen trousers and a huge quantity of porcelain. Newspapers announced her return, and stores up and down the East Coast sold her cargo. [The return to her investors was 25%](http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/boatload-ginseng-launched-china-trade/), less than had been hoped but enough to encourage others to invest in further trading with China. 

Trade with China helped to build the new nation and would contribute to making the United Staes a major maritime power in the 19th century.  It is indeed a pity how little today’s politicians have learned from history.
