*After 65 years, memories of a fateful night on the icy Baltic Sea still surface for local sisters Irene East and Ellen Maybee.*

*Saturday marked the 65th anniversary of the sinking of the German ship MV Wilhelm Gustloff, considered to be largest loss of life in a single incident in maritime history.  
*  
*The ship was designed to carry a maximum 1,800 passengers and crew. On the night of its sinking, Jan. 30, 1945, it was carrying more than 10,000 passengers. A mere 1,230 survived.*

*The Wilhelm Gustloff’s final voyage was part of Operation Hannibal, an evacuation of German troops and civilians who were surrrounded by the advancing Soviet Red Army. The ship departed from the harbour at Gdynia in occupied Poland and was bound for Kiel, Germany.*

*Tecumseh residents East and Maybee (nee Tschinkur) were on the Wilhelm Gustloff with their mother, Serafima and cousin, Evelyn Krachmanow, when a Soviet submarine fired three torpedoes at the ship’s port side.*
