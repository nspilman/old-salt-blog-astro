[![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/02/102910_7394-bernie-Ente-sq-.jpg)PortSide New York](http://portsidenewyork.org/) is one of the absolutely best waterfront educational organizations in New York harbor.   Centered around the historic coastal tanker *[Mary A.Whalen](http://www.portsidenewyork.org/mary_whalen.htm)*, PortSide has sponsored a wide range of great programs ranging from activities for kids and adults, to [hosting visiting tall ships](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/19/barquentine-gazela-arrives-in-new-york-harbor/), to [shanty sings](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/05/songs-of-many-waters-on-the-deck-of-the-tanker-mary-whalen/) and  even [staging opera on the deck of the tanker](http://youtu.be/c7iH99gmkQI).  Now Portside is in trouble. For the last six years, the *Mary A. Whalen* has never had a permanent home.  Now it needs to find one by April 30th.  If not, the old tanker may be scrapped.  
  
For those in the New York area there will be a public meeting to discuss the [Portside Action Plan](http://www.portsidenewyork.org/SavePortSide+MaryWhalen_flyer.pdf) on Monday, February 27th 6:30-8:30pm, Long Island College Hospital (LICH) Conference Rooms A & B, 339 Hicks Street, Brooklyn NY 11201 at the corner of Hicks & Atlantic Avenue. To donate to help give PortSide save the *Mary A. Whalen*, [click here](http://portsidenewyork.org/).
