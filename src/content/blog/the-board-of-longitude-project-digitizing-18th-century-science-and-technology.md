The [Board of Longitude Project](http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/longitude/about/), a partnership between [Cambridge University Library](http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/longitude) and the [National Maritime Museum](http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/longitude/) at Greenwich in the UK, has digitized the complete papers of the [Board of Longitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Longitude) from its founding in 1714 until its abolition in 1828.  Embedded below is a playlist of five very well done videos about the project.

The Commissioners for the Discovery of the Longitude at Sea, popularly known as the Board of Longitude, was established following the [Scilly naval disaster of 1707](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scilly_naval_disaster_of_1707) which resulted in the loss of four Royal Navy warships and more than 1,400 sailors. The disaster was blamed on the inability to accurately determine longitude.
