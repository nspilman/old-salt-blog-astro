![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/04/brilliant200.jpg)Happy birthday to [Mystic Seaport](https://www.mysticseaport.org)‘s schooner [*Brilliant*](https://www.mysticseaport.org/news/2017/happy-85th-birthday-brilliant/)! On April 23, 1932, the 61′ schooner was launched from the yard of Henry B. Nevins at City Island, New York. Now 85 years later, she is still sailing and still a beauty.

She was built for Walter Barnum, who raced her extensively.  In World War II, she served as an anti-submarine picket boat. She was donated to the Mystic Seaport Museum, in 1953, where she has served as an offshore classroom for the the museum’s education programs.

Sailing aboard *Brilliant*, people of all ages have the opportunity to learn about sailing on one of the finest wooden schooners ever built. Since she was donated to the museum, *Brilliant* has sailed the equivalent of five times around the earth, with more than 9,000 students setting her sails and steering her course. *WoodenBoat Magazine* described *Brilliant* as one of the 100 most beautiful classic boats in existence and as “one of the best maintained and sailed classic yachts in the country — if not the world.”
