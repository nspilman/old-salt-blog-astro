![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/01/FOCIlogo.jpg)The effort to save the Falls of Clyde has suffered at least a temporary setback. Last [November, we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/11/falls-of-clyde-heading-toward-scotland-in-2019/) about an announcement by the [Save the Falls of Clyde — International](https://www.facebook.com/savefallsofclyde/), a group endeavoring to move the [*Falls of Clyde*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_of_Clyde_\(ship\)), the last surviving iron-hulled, four-masted full-rigged ship, from Hawaii back to Scotland for restoration. The announcement read, in part: “*After many months of negotiation, a deal has finally agreed between this group and Sevenstar Yacht Transfer, to collect the ‘Falls of Clyde’. She will be loaded onboard their flo/flo ship, ‘Yacht Express ‘ during the week 3rd February 2019.”*

Recently, the group has announced that the move will be delayed pending finalization of sponsorship. They announced on January 4th: 

*I regret to inform supporters that we have decided to cancel the planned lift operation scheduled for the 3rd February of the Falls of Clyde.  T**here are a variety of reasons for this decision but in the main, we are not ready. We have been engaging with major sponsors for the lift exercise, however, negotiations are taking longer than envisaged.*

*If we had proceeded we would only have created issues here in Scotland on arrival and that is not what we planned. Our sponsorship package is currently being evaluated by many companies across the globe, with meetings being scheduled here in the U.K. to discuss further.*

*We need your support more than ever as she is still in danger of being lost forever, we will continue with this effort and update you of developments.*
