![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Soren_20_Pacific330.jpg)Last December [we posted](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/12/17/brigantine-s%C3%B8ren-larsen-larsen-available-for-sale-by-syndication/) that the [Tallship *Soren Larsen*](http://www.sorenlarsen.co.nz/index.html) was for sale.  She has now apparently been acquired by new owners who will move the ship to Sydney, Australia but will otherwise maintain her Pacific sailing schedules.  We wish the new owners and operators the best of luck with this beautiful ship.  From the [Soren Larsen Newsletter](http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=19221aaf97109f37934716c6c&id=fd52f516cb&e=4aed723aa5):

*The Tallship Soren Larsen will be sailing towards a future base and new owners in Sydney at the end of this year, with the professional and experienced team at Sydney Tallships. Her 2011 Pacific voyages will complete as planned in October when the Soren Larsen sails from New Caledonia to Sydney. The “Bluewater” leg across the Tasman Sea to New Zealand is the only change.*   
  
*Despite a change in home port,from which she will day-sail the magnificent Sydney Harbour, it will be business as usual when it comes to the Pacific voyages. In 2012 The Tallship Soren Larsen will set out on her passages by returning to New Zealand and then to her favourite locations within the Pacific Islands as she has for many years, creating lasting memories for crew and voyagers alike.*
