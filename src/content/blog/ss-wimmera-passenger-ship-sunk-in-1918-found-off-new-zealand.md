SS Wimmera

It appears that the wreck of the *SS Wimmera*, an Australian passenger ship sunk by a mine north of New Zealand in 1918 has been located.

*The SS Wimmera, sank on June 26 when a mine laid by the German raider Wolf blew off its stern north of Cape Reinga and near the Three Kings islands.  Twenty six people, including two children, out of 151 passengers and crew lost their lives. Many of the passengers were in cabins in the stern and may not have had a chance to get off the ship.*

*Their bodies were never recovered and the ship was considered “lost” until it was found by Auckland electronics expert Mike Hodson on Friday using an advanced underwater sonar system called WASSP developed by his company in Auckland, Electronic Navigation Ltd*
