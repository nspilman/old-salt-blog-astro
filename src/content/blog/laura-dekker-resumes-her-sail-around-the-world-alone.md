![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/11/0804-wire-Laura-Dekker-DUTC.jpg)After waiting out the hurricane season in the Canary Islands  15-year-old Dutch sailor [Laura Dekker](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/index.php?s=laura+dekker) has resumed her attempt to sail around the world alone on her 38′ ketch *Guppy*.   Ms. Dekker had been at the center of a ten month Dutch court battle to determine whether she would be allowed to sail alone.   If she completes her around the world voyage prior to the middle September 2012, she will earn the title of the youngest solo circumnavigator, a designation now held by Australian [Jessica Watson](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/index.php?s=jessica+watson).  As Dekker plans on making multiple stops in her voyage, Watson will likely continue to retain the title as the youngest sailor to complete a non-stop solo  circumnavigation.
