*For wildlife conservationists, the tragic death of* [*SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau*](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/os-dawn-brancheau-profile-seaworld-orland20100224,0,4347984.story) *is a sobering reminder of why creatures as large and majestic as killer whales simply should not live in captivity.*

*The [World Society for the Protection of Animals](http://www.wspa-international.org/) and th[e Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society](http://www.wdcs.org/)* *are just two of the organizations that have campaigned against the practice. First, they say, killer whales in captivity often get sick and live on average only into their 20s (though there are exceptions). In the wild, the females typically live into their 50s or beyond and the males at least into their 30s.*  
  
*Advocates for the orca blame the stress of captivity — the lack of natural social groups, the tight confines, the chemically treated water. Scientists will tell you these are highly intelligent creatures with entrenched socialization habits and sophisticated communication skills. Most obviously, they say, there is the size issue: At 26 feet long and weighing roughly six tons, an orca should be not be spending its life in a tank instead of freely in an ocean.*

*SeaWorld has argued that the Shamu shows help people, especially children, learn to appreciate the killer whales and foster a desire to protect their habitat. Critics suggest that perhaps they should stick with such entertainment as the “Pets Ahoy!” show the park started using shelter dogs and cats and other small animals, who probably live a pretty happy life at the park. These, after all, are creatures domesticated over centuries.*

*But Tilikum has been involved with the death of two humans before this, including another trainer. Some might be tempted to think of it as a sign that this particular orca is vicious, but conservationists point out that, in the wild, some killer whales prey on large whales and sharks – often suffocating or otherwise disabling their meal by throwing it in the air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it or holding it upside down and immobile.*

*As the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society writes: “Captive orcas are not domesticated… These tragic events are a reminder that orcas are powerful and often unpredictable animals.”*
