![peep_chick-with-r-1-authorized-for-publication](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/peep_chick-with-r-1-authorized-for-publication.jpg)Recently the folks at [Sailing Scuttlebutt](https://www.facebook.com/sailingscuttlebutt) commented that it looked as if the boats in the [Stark Raving Mad](http://stark-raving-mad.com/) 2014 Heineken Regatta were being sailed by [“peeps,” the ubiquitous, if largely inedible](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/04/18/easter-traditions-explained/7865171/), marshmallow candies, sold in the United States and Canada, that make their appearance in the Spring, particularly around Easter.  Watching the video, I do believe that they are right.  An unexpected downside to matching foul weather-gear.  A lovely video for an Easter Sunday, nevertheless.
