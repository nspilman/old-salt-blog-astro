![manhattanflooded](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/02/manhattanflooded.jpg)Recent studies suggest that sea levels are now rising at the fastest rate in the last 28 centuries. According to two reports, increased flooding in coastal communities in America can be traced directly to increased the production of greenhouse gases from human activity. The report authors say that the problem will grow far worse in coming decades. Nevertheless, the governments of some states most impacted by the rising waters are opting to deny that the problem even exists.

As reported by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/science/sea-level-rise-global-warming-climate-change.html?smid=fb-share&_r=0): *“I think we need a new way to think about most coastal flooding,” said Benjamin H. Strauss, the primary author of one of two related studies released on Monday. “It’s not the tide. It’s not the wind. It’s us. That’s true for most of the coastal floods we now experience.”*

*In the second study, scientists reconstructed the level of the sea over time and confirmed that it is most likely rising faster than at any point in 28 centuries, with the rate of increase growing sharply over the past century — largely, they found, because of the warming that scientists have said is almost certainly caused by human emissions.*

*They also confirmed previous forecasts that if emissions were to continue at a high rate over the next few decades, the ocean could rise as much as three or four feet by 2100. Experts say the situation would then grow far worse in the 22nd century and beyond, likely requiring the abandonment of many coastal cities.*

*The findings are yet another indication that the stable climate in which human civilization has flourished for thousands of years, with a largely predictable ocean permitting the growth of great coastal cities, is coming to an end.*

As we posted a few years ago, the [North Carolina legislature considered a bill to make it illegal for local planning boards to consider climate change](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/06/north-carolina-legislature-plays-xerxes-considers-making-sea-level-rise-illegal/) for zoning purposes. The planning boards would be required to use to only use predictions of sea level rise based on linear projections from 1900. The increased rise in sea-level due to climate change would not only be ignored but would be illegal for land use planning.

Just last year, [Florida state environmental officials were ordered not to use the terms “climate change”](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article12983720.html) or “global warming” in any government communications, emails, or reports. The policy affects reports, educational efforts and public policy at the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, a department with about 3,200 employees and $1.4 billion budget.

In Florida, rising sea-levels threaten 30 percent of the state’s beach communities over the next 85 years.

Despite the fact that there is a broad consensus in the scientific community regarding the problems associated with climate change, there is also a deep divide in the American political circus. While the two primary Democratic candidates running for president in 2016 call for action on climate change, the Republican candidates deny that there is a problem. [Donald Trump](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/23/climate-change-republican-party-trump-inhofe) is quoted as saying, “*The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.*”
