Sovereign and the Monarch in Turkish scrapyard

In early February, outbreaks of the coronavirus began to occur on cruise ships. On one quarantined ship, the [*Diamond Princess*](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200729/gene-study-shows-how-coronavirus-swept-through-the-idiamond-princessi#1), one infection spread to over 700 cases and seven deaths from COVID-19. In March of 2020, the cruise industry was effectively shut down by a Center for Disease Control (CDC) “[No Sail Order](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0409-modifications-extension-no-sail-ships.html).” Recent attempts to restart even [limited cruising have not been notably successful.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/11/cruise-lines-ready-to-restart-with-trial-cruises-first-attempt-sees-shipboard-outbreak/)

Not surprisingly, [several cruise lines have ceased operations](https://www.cruisemapper.com/news/8017-sixth-cruise-line-shuts-down-covid-19) and at least [11 cruise ships have been sent to the scrapyards.](https://www.cruises-info.com/2020/12/11-cruise-ships-sold-and-being-scrapped.html?fbclid=IwAR0VCPBnUCoXsmbefSc8D7lJud2s5_D9dQLSf5j09hyylH1Bnt3uFEv1UHU) Nevertheless, [16 new cruise ships were delivered in 2020](https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/cruise-ship-orderbook.html), most of which sailed directly to layup. Now in 2021, an additional 30 cruise ships are scheduled to be delivered from shipyards around the world. Incredibly, another 31 ships are scheduled for delivery in 2022.

The multibillion-dollar question is whether this new fleet of cruise ships will find gainful employment? Will people be willing to return to cruising? Will the advent of new vaccines make cruising safe again? As is so often the case in these challenging times, there appear to be no easy answers.
