Comanche: Jim Clark and Kristy Hinze-Clark.

Despite having a damaged rudder, the American super-maxi *Comanche* was first across the finish line in this year’s Rolex Sydney-Hobart Race, [leading the next closest boat, *Rambler* by roughly 50 miles](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/234272d4b8a549248d3dd08593d945b0/comanche-wins-sydney-hobart-race). This is the first time since 1998 that an American yacht has won line honors in the race.

Last year, [the brand new *Comanche* took second behind eight-time winner *Wild Oats XI*.](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-28/2014-sydney-to-hobart-yacht-race-winner/5990156) This year, *Wild Oats XI* was forced to retire with a ripped mainsail. The same storm that sent *Wild Oats XI* back to the dock also seriously damaged one of *Comanche*‘s rudders.

Despite their impressive win, this may be the first and last win in the Sydney-Hobart Race for *Comanche*.  Before this year’s race, Jim Clark, the billionaire co-owner of *Comanche* with his wife Kristy Hinze-Clark, said that the boat would not be returning to the Sydney-Hobart next season, citing the expense, time and distance. On the other hand, [Stuff.co.nz](http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/75467155/sydney-to-hobart-win-or-lose-comanche-will-not-return-next-year) reports that “*the only reason Comanche returned to Australia for the 628-nautical-mile race after last year finishing second on line honours to the Mark Richards-skippered Wild Oats XI in her first ocean race was due his wife’s urging.*”

Clark was not able to sail the race this year because of arthritis. His wife, former model Kristy Hinze-Clark, was aboard as crew. One can only wonder if she will convince him, once more, to return *Comanche* to the race next year, if only to get the chance to once again compete boat-to-boat with *Wild Oats XI* .
