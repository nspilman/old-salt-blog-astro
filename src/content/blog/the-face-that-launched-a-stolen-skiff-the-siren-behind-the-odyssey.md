![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/4450741.jpg)As Shakespeare noted, “the course of true love never did run smooth.”   That was literally the case when, in early October,  Tokelaun teenager Filo Filo, with two of his friends, set off to visit a young lady on the neighboring Fakaofo atoll, some sixty miles away.  The skiff ran out of fuel and the boys drifted for fifty days across nearly 1,000 miles of the Pacific ocean in the small aluminum dinghy before being rescued by a passing fishing vessel.   Now the young lady whose face launched the stolen skiff  has been revealed.  She has been communicating with her young suitor by Facebook.  Thanks to [Joan Druett](http://members.authorsguild.net/druettjo/) for passing along the article.
