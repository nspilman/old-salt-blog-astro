The [US Navy announced in a statement](https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/3645156/uss-georgia-ssgn-729-blue-crew-commanding-officer-relieved/) that on January 12, 2024, Commander, Submarine Group Ten, Rear Adm. Thomas “T.R.” Buchanan, relieved Capt. Geoffry Patterson as commanding officer of USS *Georgia* (SSGN 729) Blue Crew due to loss of confidence in his ability to command.

The USS *Georgia* is homeported at King’s Bay, Georgia. According to data from the Camden County Sheriff’s Office, where King’s Bay is located, Patterson was arrested in the early hours of Jan. 9 on charges including driving under the influence and improper lane change, reports [Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/01/16/navy-relieves-guided-missile-submarine-skipper-following-arrest-driving-under-influence.html/amp).  According to the sheriff’s website, Patterson was released on bond after a payment of more than $1,800.

Patterson [took command of the submarine’s blue crew](https://www.navy.mil/Resources/Photo-Gallery/igphoto/2003012774/) in May 2022. The [Ohio-class](https://www.military.com/equipment/ssgn-ohio-class-guided-missile-submarine) guided-missile submarine USS *Georgia*‘s last [deployment](https://www.military.com/deployment) appears to have [wrapped up shortly after that, in September 2022](https://www.dvidshub.net/image/7431246/uss-georgia-ssgn-729-returns-kings-bay). The submarine had been forward-deployed for more than two years — 790 days.

The Navy currently has four guided-missile submarines that were converted from Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines. Instead of nuclear missiles, the four boats instead carry up to 154 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles and train to deliver [special operations](https://www.military.com/special-operations) forces on covert missions.

Each Navy ballistic and guided-missile submarine has two sets of crews, blue and gold. They take turns manning the submarines and taking them on patrol.

The Navy said that Capt. Christopher Osborn, the commanding officer of USS *Georgia* gold crew, is now in charge of the boat and noted that “there is no impact to operations.”
