![RubberDuck_slide](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/RubberDuck_slide.jpg)We have followed the peripatetic wanderings of the [Big Rubber Duck](http://www.florentijnhofman.nl/dev/project.php?id=154) as it has made its way around the globe. The series of inflatable sculptures by  Dutch artist [Florentijn Hofman](http://www.florentijnhofman.nl/dev/), is named “Spreading Joy Around the World” but is universally known simply as “Rubber Duck.” The Big Rubber Duck was recently in [Norfolk, VA](http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/10575-huge-global-rubber-duck-resurfaces-in-norfolk-usa.html) but will be sailing into the [Port of Los Angeles leading the Tall Ships Grand Parade of Sail](http://www.marinelink.com/news/largest-worlds-rubber368886.aspx) at the [Tall Ships Festival L.A](http://tallshipsfestivalla.com/)., August 20, 2014.  It will be the first West Coast appearance of the Big Rubber Duck which has visited more than seventeen cities in at least 10 different countries.

Florentijn Hofman describes his project as follow: *The Rubber Duck knows no frontiers, it doesn’t discriminate people and doesn’t have a political connotation. The friendly, floating Rubber Duck has healing properties: it can relieve mondial tensions as well as define them. The rubber duck is soft, friendly and suitable for all ages!*

Nevertheless, the Rubber Duck’s travels around the world have been not without adventure.  In [2009, while on display in Belgium,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_Duck_\(sculpture\)#Display) vandals stabbed the Rubber Duck forty two times times.  While in [Hong Kong it suddenly deflated](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2013/06/spreading-joy-around-the-world-aka-rubber-duck-inflated-deflated-revived-censored/) and in [Taiwan last New Year’s Eve, it exploded](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/01/giant-yellow-duck-explodes-in-taiwan/).  Nevertheless, the duck always rises again.
