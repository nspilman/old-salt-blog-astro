After a service life of almost 40 years, the Soviet light cruiser *[Murmansk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_cruiser_Murmansk_\(1955\))* was decommissioned and sold for scrap.  On Christmas Eve in 1994, the ship was under tow to India when the tug lost control of the ship in a storm.  The *Murmansk* ran aground outside the harbor breakwater just off Sørvær in northern Norway.  In 2009 money was finally appropriated to remove the wreck.   The plan is to enclose the wreck behind new temporary jetties, drain the water around the wreck, then cut the vessel in pieces on the dry bottom.  The operation should be completed in 2011.   The wreck removal is being documented as a part of a new documentary.   A [panoramic webcam](http://murmansk.livecam360.com/flash/main.php) also has been set up for those wishing to monitor progress of the project.  Click  on the image above to see the panorama.
