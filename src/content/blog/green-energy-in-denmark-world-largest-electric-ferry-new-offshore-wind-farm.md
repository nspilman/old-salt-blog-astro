![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/08/ellenferry.jpg)Last week, the *Ellen*, the [world’s largest all-electric ferry](https://electrek.co/2019/08/21/worlds-largest-electric-ferry/), completed its maiden voyage in Denmark.

From a press release by [Leclanché](https://www.leclanche.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190815-Leclanch%C3%A9-Eferry_PIC.pdf), the provider of the batteries to power the ferry:

*The world’s largest all-electric ferry, named Eferry Ellen, made its first commercial trip early this morning, Thursday, August 15, 2019, connecting the ports of Søby and Fynshav, on the islands of Aerø and Als, in southern Denmark. This revolutionary ship, capable of carrying approximately 30 vehicles and 200 passengers, is powered by a battery system with an unprecedented capacity of 4.3MWh provided by Leclanché SA (SIX: LECN), one of the world’s leading energy storage companies*

The company claims that the 60 m long ferry will “prevent the release of 2000 tonnes of CO2, 42 tonnes of NOX, 2.5 tonnes of particulates and 1.4 tonnes of SO2 into the atmosphere” on an annual basis.

The [*Ellen* can sail approximately 40.7km between charges](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/denmark-electric-ferry), giving it a range that is seven times longer than any other fully electric car ferry. The distance between Søby and Fynshav is 17.2km miles, and it’s 15.2km between Søby and Fåborg. This means that it is capable of making a round-trip between the destinations and returning to the charging station in Søby to get topped up again.

While the *Ellen* has zero direct emissions, its batteries are charged by electricity from the Danish electrical grid. Even so, an electric ferry is likely to have a far lower carbon footprint than a comparable diesel-powered vessel. In comparison, electric vehicles on shore, powered from the grid by fossil fuels, have a [carbon footprint up to 68% lower](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/02/19/electric-car-well-to-wheel-emissions-myth/) than internal combustion vehicles.

The situation is even better in Denmark, however, which gets a significant percentage of its electricity from wind power. In 2017, [Denmark’s electricity sector used wind power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Denmark) to produce the equivalent of 43.4% of Denmark’s total electricity consumption. 

That percentage will only increase. This week, Denmark’s Crown Prince Frederik officially opened what is claimed to be [the largest offshore wind farm in Denmark](https://www.energylivenews.com/2019/08/22/royal-opening-for-denmarks-largest-offshore-wind-farm-3/). The Horns Rev 3 project consists of 49 turbines and has a total capacity of 407MW, expected to generate enough electricity to power 425,000 households.

It will support Denmark’s low carbon ambitions and boost wind power production in the country by 12%.

And Greenland is still not for sale.
