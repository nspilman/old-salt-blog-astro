![hi-franklin-skulls-cp-9117292](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hi-franklin-skulls-cp-9117292.jpg)Exactly what happened to the ill-fated [Franklin expedition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin's_lost_expedition) remains a mystery.  in 1845, Captain Sir John Franklin, with a crew 129, attempted to traverse the last unnavigated section of the Northwest Passage and never returned.  Some of the bodies expedition crew have been found but the wrecks of the two ships, [*Erebus* and *Terror* have never been located](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/08/location-of-hms-erebus-and-hms-terror-still-a-mystery/) despite a century and a half of searching.  What is fascinating about the story is that parts of the mystery as to what happened to the expedition have appeared to have been solved several times, only to have new findings debunk the previous explanation.   A new study suggests that the current theory of the failed expedition may also be flawed.

In 1984, three bodies of Franklin’s sailors where exhumed from a grave on Beechey Island. All three corpses were found to have high levels of lead in their bones. While lead poisoning did not kill the sailors, the high levels might explain some of the weakness and irrational behavior evidenced during the expedition. The initial source of the high lead levels was identified as the solder on poorly made food cans.  Further analysis suggests that there was not enough lead in the cans to have caused the observed lead in the sailor’s bones.

Next, [the hot water system on the ships](http://www.hakluyt.com/PDF/Battersby_Franklin.pdf) was singled out as the culprit. Now however, chemists at the University of Western Ontario have concluded there was so much lead in the bones, and it was distributed so widely, that it couldn’t have accumulated during the few months the men were at sea before they died.

“*The wide distribution and high concentrations of lead in the measured bones is indicative of long-term exposure before the start of the expedition,*” says Professor Ron Martin, who recently published a paper on their findings.  Martin’s team concludes that if Franklin and his men were poisoned by lead, it probably began long before they set sail for what is now the Canadian Arctic.

“We’ll probably never know what happened to the crew of the Franklin \[expedition\], so it will remain one of the great mysteries of Canadian history,” said Professor Martin.
