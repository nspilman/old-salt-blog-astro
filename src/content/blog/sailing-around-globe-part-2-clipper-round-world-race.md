![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/05/clipperrtw.jpg)Yesterday, we posted about signing aboard as trainee crew on the square rigged barque *Picton Castle,* to sail all or part of the way around the world. But what if you want to sail in a globe girdling ocean race instead of on a beautiful square-rigger? To participate in an around the world ocean race usually requires millions and often tens of millions of dollars, but there is an alternative — the [Clipper Round the World Race](https://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/).  

The Clipper Round the World Race is the [global ocean race for the rest of us](http://clipperroundtheworld.com/about/about-the-race).  Doctors, lawyers, students and clerks all have the opportunity, for a fee, to match race around the world on a fleet of twelve identical yachts. The race is the brainchild of sailing legend, [Sir Robin Knox-Johnston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Knox-Johnston), the first person to sail solo non-stop around the world, and is run every two years. The race is now in its eleventh edition. The entire race is 40,000 nautical miles around the world on 70-foot ocean racing yachts, sailed in eight legs and 14 to 16 individual races. Each boat has a professional captain and the crew may sign on for the entire around the world race or for specific legs. 

The [current fee](https://issuu.com/clipperrace/docs/clipper_recruitment_brochure.2017-1) to sail the entire 2017-2018 race around the world is £ 49,500 or approximately $US 64,000.  Each of the individual eight legs cost between £ 5,00 to £ 6,500, ($6,000 to $8,400) not including a mandatory £ 5,500 ($7,100) 26 day training course.
