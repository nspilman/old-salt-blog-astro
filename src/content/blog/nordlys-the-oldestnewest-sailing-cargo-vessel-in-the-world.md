![nordlys](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nordlys.jpg)The coastal cargo ketch [*Nordlys* is making ready to sail](http://fairtransport.eu/big-news-nordlys-ready-about/). She is either the newest sailing cargo venture or the oldest sailing cargo ship depending on how you look at it. Built in 1873 in the Isle of Wight, this 141 year old fishing ketch is the oldest sailing cargo ship in the world, while also being the newest addition to the [Fairtransport](http://fairtransport.eu/) sailing cargo fleet. *[Nordlys](http://fairtransport.eu/ships/nordlys/)* – meaning “Northern Lights,” will move up to 30 tonnes of cargo around Europe, the UK and Scandinavia.

Other ships in the Fairtransport fleet include the 32 meter brigantine, [*Tres Hombres*](http://fairtransport.eu/ships/tres-hombres/), which carries cargo between Europe, the Islands in the Atlantic, the Caribbean and America.  She can carry 35 tons of cargo and is sailed by a crew of five professional sailors and 10 trainees.

Also sailing with Fairtransport is the three masted lugger, *Grayhound.*  The lugger has an overall sparred length of 108ft and sets 3500 square foot of sail which can drive her hull at speeds over 14 knots. This is her first year carrying cargo.
