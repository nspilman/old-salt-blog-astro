Here is an only slightly less threatening story of a [mischievous female sea otter](https://news.yahoo.com/mischievous-sea-otter-keeps-stealing-204403265.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHdBrcio7wK4BgnBQApBrLfDKmEly1WJ8-4IsjOJlfHv5MvYyABylY_T2gNOumpfIQCFiI5uYfoTRzKANCqznkfC7f1tTKsxOsRgMs8NDRvfsdfZ0GN8bVfTWIjpnOtXnnUwCS7loBFJd0n7el7VRvrZuXLvOS4rZVKeLimgGWuw) which has been harassing surfers and stealing surfboards in Santa Cruz, California.

For the past few summers, numerous surfers have been victims of [boardjacking by a female sea otter](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/12/science/sea-otter-surfboard.html?smid=nytcore-android-share), which accosts the wave riders, seizing and even damaging their surfboards in the process.

After a weekend in which the otter’s behavior seemed to grow more aggressive, wildlife officials in the area said on Monday they have decided to put a stop to these acts of otter larceny.

“Due to the increasing public safety risk, a team from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Monterey Bay Aquarium trained in the capture and handling of sea otters has been deployed to attempt to capture and rehome her,” a spokesperson for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said in a statement.

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/12/science/sea-otter-surfboard.html?smid=nytcore-android-share) reports that local officials call the animal Otter 841. The 5-year-old female is well known, for both her bold behavior and her ability to hang 10. And she has a tragic back story, with officials now forced to take steps that illustrate the ways human desire to get close to wild animals can cost the animals their freedom, or worse, their lives.

Otters have been known to approach humans during hormonal surges that coincide with a pregnancy, or as a result of being fed or repeatedly approached by people. That is likely what occurred with otter 841’s mother.

She was orphaned and raised in captivity. But after she was released into the wild, humans started offering her squid and she quickly became habituated. She was removed again when she started climbing aboard kayaks in search of handouts, ending up at the Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center in Santa Cruz, where researchers quickly realized she was pregnant. It was while back in captivity that she gave birth to 841.

The pup was raised by her mother until she was weaned, then moved to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. To bolster her chances for success upon release, 841’s caretakers took measures to prevent the otter from forming positive associations with humans, including wearing masks and ponchos that obscured their appearance when they were around her.

Yet 841 quickly lost her fear of humans, though local experts cannot explain precisely why.

“After one year of being in the wild without issue, we started receiving reports of her interactions with surfers, kayakers and paddle boarders,” Jessica Fujii, sea otter program manager at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, said. “We do not know why this started. We have no evidence that she was fed. But it has persisted in the summers for the last couple of years.”

The New York Times notes that Otter 841 was first observed climbing aboard water craft in Santa Cruz in 2021. At first, the behavior was a rarity, but over time the otter grew more bold. This past weekend, the otter was observed stealing surfboards on three separate occasions.

If the authorities succeed in capturing 841, she will return to the Monterey Bay Aquarium before being transferred to a different one, where she will live out her days. Her captors have their work cut out for them. Multiple attempts to capture her have been made, none successful.

“She’s been quite talented at evading us,” Ms. Fujii said.

Until the otter can be captured, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife is asking surfers to avoid her at all costs.
