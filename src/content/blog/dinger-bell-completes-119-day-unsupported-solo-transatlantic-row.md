He arrived in Newlyn in Cornwall at about 13:00 BST on Sunday.

His team believes he is one of the first people to successfully row solo, unsupported from New York to continental Europe. Along the way, he was stung by a jellyfish, hit by huge storms, and revealed he has a fear of open water.

On arrival at Newlyn harbor Bell, from Bere Regis in Dorset, said “I’m never doing anything dangerous ever again” and celebrated with a cup of coffee and a plate of chicken and pasta.

Due to changing weather conditions and incoming winds he decided to make landfall at Newlyn, rather than Falmouth as planned.

Bell’s row raised money for the [charities](https://ny2uksolorow.co.uk/charities/) the [Special Boat Service Association](https://www.theassociation.org.uk/) and [Rock2Recovery](https://rock2recovery.co.uk/).
