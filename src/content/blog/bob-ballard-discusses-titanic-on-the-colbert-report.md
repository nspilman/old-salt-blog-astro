[Robert Ballard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ballard), the oceanographer who lead the expedition which discovered the wreck of the *Titanic* in 1985, was interviewed by [Stephen Colbert](http://www.colbertnation.com/about) on the [Colbert Report](http://www.colbertnation.com) last night. He discusses how the search for the Titanic was a cover for finding two missing nuclear submarines. (See our previous post from June 2010 – [Searching for the USS Thresher and USS Scorpion with the Titanic as Cover](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/06/14/searching-for-the-uss-thresher-and-uss-scorpion-with-the-titanic-as-cover/).)  He also discusses the problems of underwater tourism damaging the remains of the *Titanic*, and an idea to paint the sunken ship to preserve it. Yes, painting the *Titanic*.  An interesting interview, indeed.
