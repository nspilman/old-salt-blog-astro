![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/02/sandpiper-rescue.jpg)Here is a strange story of a heroic rescue by the US Coast Guard, a stolen boat, and a dead fish left on the front porch of a house in Astoria, Oregon, where the cult classic adventure/comedy movie, [The Goonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goonies) was filmed in 1985.

Or perhaps, this is properly two separate stories :

### The Rescue 

The mouth of the Columbia River, where the swells from the Pacific Ocean break over the river bar, is notoriously treacherous. The river bar is frequently called the “Graveyard of the Pacific.” Last Friday around 10 AM, the [Coast Guard received a Mayday call](https://www.news.uscg.mil/Press-Releases/Article/3288449/coast-guard-rescues-mariner-in-distress-as-wave-capsizes-vessel-near-mouth-of-c/) over VHF from the 35′ motor yacht *Sandpiper.* The boat was in trouble, approximately 6 miles west of the Columbia River mouth.

Coast Guard crews aboard a 47-foot Motor Lifeboat and an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter aircrew of the Advanced Rescue Helicopter School were dispatched from Station Cape Disappointment. Multiple crews of the National Motor Lifeboat School, who were conducting training in the area, also diverted to respond. Coast Guard crews were on the scene at approximately 10:40 a.m.

The *Sandpiper* was located battling extremely high winds and 20-foot seas. The sole occupant aboard reported that the boat was taking on water.

Given the conditions, it was decided to lower a rescue swimmer from the helicopter to swim to the motor vessel.  As the swimmer made his approach, a breaking wave capsized the vessel. The boat’s occupant was ejected from the boat and suffered minor injuries.

The swimmer proceeded to retrieve the survivor from the water and both were hoisted onto the helicopter using a winch cable.

As a rescue swimmer, this was Aviation Survival Technician 3rd Class John “Branch” Walton’s first life saved. Hours later, he and his classmates graduated from the Advanced Rescue Helicopter School.

The survivor was transported to awaiting emergency medical personnel at Air Station Astoria and was in stable condition when transferred from the Coast Guard’s care. 

The rookie rescue swimmer Branch Walton and the crew of the MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter saved the boat occupant’s life. But who did they save and what was he doing in the Pacific in high winds and sea?

###  The Stolen Boat and the Dead Fish at the Goonie’s House

After the survivor of the capsized had been released from medical care, the local police arrived. The authorities had been looking for a man since the previous Wednesday who had left a fish on the porch of the house used in the movie, The Goonies, directed by Stephen Speilberg in 1985. In the film, a bunch of kids from Astoria, Oregon discover an old treasure map that takes them on an adventure to unearth the long-lost fortune of One-Eyed Willy, a legendary 17th-century pirate. During the adventure, they are chased by a family of criminals who want the treasure for themselves.

The film has become a cult classic and the house where part of the movie was filmed has become a local tourist attraction. None of which explains the odd vandalism of leaving a fish on the house porch.

Whatever the reason, the police knew who the miscreant was because he had posted about it on social media. Astoria Police Chief Stacy Kelly identified the man as Jericho Labonte, 35, of Victoria, British Columbia. Labonte is also wanted in British Columbia on criminal harassment, mischief, and failure to comply cases from last fall, Kelly said.

The owner of the *Sandpiper* reported the vessel stolen later Friday, the police chief said.

Labonte was arrested on Friday evening at a homeless shelter where he was staying “under an alias,” on charges of theft, criminal mischief, endangering another person, and unauthorized use of a vehicle.

“It’s been a really odd 48 hours,” Kelly said.
