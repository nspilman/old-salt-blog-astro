![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/12/fairport.jpg)We recently posted about the 105th anniversary of the [Battle of the Falklands](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/12/the-mystery-of-the-battle-of-the-falklands-12-8-1914/) and the [discovery of the wreckage](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/12/wreck-of-german-wwi-cruiser-scharnhorst-discovered-off-falklands/) of the German armored cruiser, [SMS *Scharnhorst*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Scharnhorst) which was sunk in the battle. In researching these posts there was one bit of historical trivia which seems worth sharing — the appearance of a sailing ship, which sailed directly between the combatants at the beginning of the battle.

The battle was a disaster for the German squadron under the command of Vice-Admiral Maximilian Graf von Spee. His German East Asia Squadron of 2 armoured cruisers, 3 light cruisers, and 3 transports was outnumbered and outgunned by the British squadron of 2 battlecruisers, 3 armoured cruisers, 2 light cruisers,  and 1 pre-dreadnought commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Frederick Doveton Sturdee.  All the German ships would ultimately be lost, save one transport which escaped. The British suffered 10 killed with 19 wounded, while the Germans lost 1,871 including Admiral Spee and his two sons. 

Just as the British and Germans began to engage, according to (British) [CDR H. Spencer-Cooper,](http://www.gwpda.org/naval/j09falkm.htm) “at this juncture a full-rigged sailing ship appeared on the port hand of our battle cruisers; she was painted white, and her sails were shining as if bleached in the bright sunlight… So close was she that the Admiral was forced to alter his course to pass a couple of miles clear of her so that the enemy’s shell ricochetting should not hit her.”

The ship was the Norwegian flag three-masted Jubilee-rigged steel sailing ship *Fairport,* homeward bound from Chile. Lacking a radio, the ship’s captain reportedly did not know that the war had broken out until he saw and heard the battle cruiser’s guns blazing from behind the clouds of coal smoke belching from their boilers. 

Perhaps fortuitously, this was the *Fairport’s* first voyage under the Norwegian flag. She was built in 1896 by the Scottish shipbuilder Russell & Co. Ltd. at Greenock for Liverpool owners. Renamed [*Spangereid*](https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?116287), she sailed until 1920 when she burned at St. Helena after her cargo of coal caught fire.
