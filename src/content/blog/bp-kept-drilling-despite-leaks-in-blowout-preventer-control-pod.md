![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2010/07/deepwater-horizon-explosion.jpg)There is [reported stonewalling](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/us/21hearings.html?_r=1) by witnesses who have cancelled their scheduled testimonies at the ongoing investigation of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.  Nevertheless,  startling testimony was presented this Tuesday:

*A BP official, Ronald Sepulvado, a well-site leader, testified that BP continued drilling for oil in the days before the disaster despite internal reports of a leak on a safety device on the rig.*  
  
*Mr. Sepulvado said he reported the problem to senior company officials and assumed it would be relayed to the Minerals Management Service, the predecessor to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, which regulates offshore drilling. The leak was on a control pod connected to the blowout preventer, an emergency mechanism that failed to activate after the April 20 disaster.*

In [separate testimony](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/23/AR2010072302515.html), the chief engineer on the Deepwater Horizon stated that the warning systems on the drilling rig were bypassed for over a year prior to the explosion and sinking of the rig.

BP just kept drilling and the rest is grim and ugly history.
