I love the odd confluence of elements in this story. It seems a young couple, Kim & Kevin, decided to get married at [Mystic Aquarium](http://www.mysticaquarium.org/), in Mystic,Connecticut. They decided that the service would be held directly in front of the beluga tank.   For music, they chose a marachi band, “Los Trovadores de America.”  It seems that a beluga named Juna became very interested in the mariachi band and/or their music and began to move along with the music.  Someone caught it on video (of course), put it up on Youtube. Juna  being serenaded by the mariachi band has become an internet sensation getting almost 1.8 million views.

One even stranger video, at least from my perspective, is that of the service itself, in which a beluga whale, probably Juna, appears to be looking over the minister’s shoulder as he performs the wedding.  The juxtapostion borders on the surreal.

On a more serious but equally happy note, [Mystic Aquarium and we presume Juna, weathered Hurricane Irene just fine](http://www.stamfordplus.com/stm/information/nws1/publish/storms/Mystic-Aquarium-spared-in-storm14284.shtml).
