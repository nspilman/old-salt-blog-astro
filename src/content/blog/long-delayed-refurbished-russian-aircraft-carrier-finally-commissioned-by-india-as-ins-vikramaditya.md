![INS_Vikramaditya_during_trials](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/11/INS_Vikramaditya_during_trials.jpg)The Indian Navy has finally taken delivery of a modified the Kiev class aircraft carrier, which it purchased from the Russians in 2002.  The ship was actually given to the Indian Navy with the stipulation that the estimated $800 million in modifications and repairs would be done in a Russian shipyard.  Now, 11 years later and after spending approximately $2.3 billion dollars, the Indian Navy has finally commissioned the carrier, [INS *Vikramaditya*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Vikramaditya).

The Russians built a total of  four Kiev class aircraft carriers. One was scrapped. Two were turned into [Chinese military theme parks exhibits and/or hotels.](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/01/china-to-open-luxury-hotel-on-soviet-aircraft-carrier-kiev/)  It is still unclear whether the Chinese or the Indians got the better deal.

The long delayed yet newly refurbished aircraft carrier began its life 26 years ago as the *Baku*, but was renamed [*Admiral Gorshkov*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_aircraft_carrier_Admiral_Gorshkov) after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.   The ship suffered a boiler room explosion in 1994, briefly returned to service in 1995, was laid in up in 1996 and put up for sale.  A new forward flight deck with a 14.3° bow ski-jump ramp has been installed along with three arrestor wires on the stern of the angled deck. The carrier will be capable of carrying MiG-29K and Sea Harrier aircraft.
