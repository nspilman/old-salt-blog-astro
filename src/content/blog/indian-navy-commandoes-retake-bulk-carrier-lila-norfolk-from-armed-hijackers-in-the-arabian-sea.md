[USNI News](https://news.usni.org/2024/01/07/indian-navy-retakes-merchant-ship-from-armed-hijackers-in-the-arabian-sea) reports that Indian Navy commandos secured the hijacked Liberian-flagged bulk carrier [MV *Lila Norfolk*](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:686757/mmsi:636023091/imo:9281700/vessel:LILA_NORFOLK) last week after a 24-hour confrontation off the Somali Coast in the Arabian Sea. 

Five to six armed hijackers boarded *Lila Norfolk* on Thursday, which was sailing 450 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia. The crew of the *Lila Norfolk*, composed of 15 Indian and six Philippine nationals, sheltered from the hijackers in the bulk carrier’s citadel and were unharmed during the entire ordeal. Indian naval forces deployed the destroyer [INS *Chennai* (D65)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Chennai_\(D65\)) as well as several helicopters and aircraft, including an American-built P-8 maritime patrol aircraft and a MQ-9B SeaGuardian drone, in response.
