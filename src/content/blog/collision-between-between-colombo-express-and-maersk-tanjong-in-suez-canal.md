This isn’t supposed to happen. The Hapag-Lloyd 8,749-teu [MV *Colombo Express*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Colombo_Express) and the 8,112-teu MV [*Maersk Tanjong*](https://www.fleetmon.com/en/vessels/Maersk_Tanjong_52816) collided today at the northern end of Egypt’s Suez Canal, near Port Said.  No casualties were reported.  MV *Colombo Express* suffered a 20-meter dent on her port bow and lost three containers over the side.  [The collision is expected to delay traffic](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/29/us-egypt-suezcanal-crash-idUSKCN0HO1GY20140929) in the canal in both directions, pending and investigation and retrieval of the lost containers. From the video and AIS trackof the accident it appears that MV *Colombo Express* steered into MV *Maersk Tanjong*
