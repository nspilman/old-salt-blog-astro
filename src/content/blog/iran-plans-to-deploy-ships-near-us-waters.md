Jamaran Mowj Class multi purpose light guided missile frigate

The Iranian state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported Tuesday, that Adm. Habibollah Sayari of the Iranian Navy announced that Iran would be sending ships near US waters.   Iran is also planning to send ships to the Gulf of Aden to help counter piracy in the region. The interesting question is, what ships do they have to send?

[‘Iran to deploy vessels near US waters’](http://www.presstv.ir/detail/201424.html)  
  
*The Iranian Navy Commander Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari says the Navy plans to deploy vessels in the Atlantic Ocean near the US sea borders.* 

*“Just like the global hegemony that is present near our marine borders, we … also plan to establish a strong presence near US marine borders,” IRNA quoted Sayyari as saying on Tuesday.*

The [Iranian Navy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_ships_of_the_Iranian_Navy) is the smallest branch of their military.   They took delivery of a new Iranian-built frigate, *[Jamaran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Frigate_Jamaran)*, earlier this year and will take delivery of a second next year.  They have three other frigates, all 40 years old and four corvettes of over 45 years old.  They have four modern diesel electric submarines as well as eleven mini-subs built in North Korea.  They have another 40 to 50 patrol craft and support ships.

[When the Iranian Navy sent two ships through the Suez Canal](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/22/iranian-navy-ships-transit-the-suez-canal-first-since-1979/) last February, then sent a cargo vessel and a frigate, *[Alvand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_frigate_Alvand)*,  built in 1971.
