![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/barqueeagle.jpg)The [USCG barque *Eagle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Eagle_\(WIX-327\)) has returned to its longstanding homeport at the US Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT, which had been the ship’s homeport since 1946. The *Eagle*, a 295-foot barque used as a training cutter for future officers of the United States Coast Guard, has been temporarily homeported in Baltimore for the last five years as it [underwent extensive restoration](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2018/03/undocking-us-coast-guard-barque-eagle/).

The *Eagle* last underwent a major overhaul more than 30 years ago and was due for another. During her recent stay in Baltimore, the ship had significant hull plating renewed and a new engine installed. The repair periods were scheduled between summer cruises and other training activities.  

The *Eagle* began its life as the Segelschulschiff *Horst Wessel.* She was built by Blohm and Voss in 1936.  At the end of World War II, the *Horst Wessel* was taken by the United States and was commissioned into the United States Coast Guard as the Coast Guard Cutter *Eagle* on May 15, 1946.
