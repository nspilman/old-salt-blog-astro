![hardtackers](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hardtackers.jpg)The [Hardtacker Shanty Crew](http://hardtackers.com/AllSeven.html), a seven-man shanty crew based in Columbus, Ohio, released a great new CD a few months ago, [*Don’t Forget Your Old Shipmates*](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Forget-Your-Old-Shipmates/dp/B00DBIYKCM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1375641597&sr=8-2&keywords=hardtackers++don%27t+forget+your+old+shipmates), which features a wonderful mix of shanties and sea songs, old and new.  The twenty one songs range from traditional shanties and forebitters such as *Whiskey Johnny*, *Congo River*, *Sally Brown* and the *Cornish Leaving Shanty* to more modern tunes, such as Stan Roger’s *Barrett’s Privateers* and *Dramamine*, a wonderful parody of *Whup Jamborree.  *Dramamine** is a song any sailor who has ever been seasick will instantly relate to.  The Hardtackers don’t ignore fresh water either, including the songs *The E-Ri-Ee Was A’risin’* and *Fifteen Miles On the Erie Canal.*

These days shanties and sea songs are often accompanied by instruments ranging from guitars and mandolins to full orchestration. The Hardtackers’ music has none of that. Their shanties are as they were sung in the age of sail. Strong voices and close harmonies carry the music along very well indeed.  Adding any sort of accompaniment would feel extraneous.

*[Don’t Forget Your Old Shipmates](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Forget-Your-Old-Shipmates/dp/B00DBIYKCM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1375641597&sr=8-2&keywords=hardtackers++don%27t+forget+your+old+shipmates)* is just great fun. It is a fine collection of sea songs, well sung, and nearly impossible not to sing along to. Highly recommended. *[Don’t Forget Your Old Shipmates](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Forget-Your-Old-Shipmates/dp/B00DBIYKCM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1375641597&sr=8-2&keywords=hardtackers++don%27t+forget+your+old+shipmates)* is available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Forget-Your-Old-Shipmates/dp/B00DBIYKCM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1375641597&sr=8-2&keywords=hardtackers++don%27t+forget+your+old+shipmates) and [CD Baby](http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/thehardtackers2).
