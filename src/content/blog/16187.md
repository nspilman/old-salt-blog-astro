MV Nordlake

Mumbai can be tough on container ships. Last August the [bulk carrier *Khalijia 3*](http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/sid/vessel/article174015.ece) steered into the [containership *MSC Chitra*](http://www.shipspotting.com/modules/myalbum/photo-48394-MSC+CHITRA) *, [](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/12/the-sinking-of-the-msc-chitra-port-re-opens-while-the-finger-pointing-intensifies/)* [sinking her, causing a significant spill and closing the port for five days](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/08/12/the-sinking-of-the-msc-chitra-port-re-opens-while-the-finger-pointing-intensifies/).    Yesterday, the  Indian warship, INS *[Vindhyagiri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Vindhyagiri_\(F42\))* and Cyprus-flagged container vessel, [MV *Nordlake*](http://www.rnkeo.com/reederei_nord/fleet/container/details/nordlake.php), collided head-on in Mumbai Harbor.  No casualties or oil spill was reported but this time the warship got the worst of it.  It is reported to have capsized after catching fire.  An investigation of the collision has been launched by the Directorate General of Shipping.   The Jewaharlal Nehru Port Trust blamed the collision on naval personnel.
