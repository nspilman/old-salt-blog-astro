![](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/04/clearwater202.jpg)The sloop [*Clearwater*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River_Sloop_Clearwater) has been sailing since 1969, spreading a message of caring for the environment and for restoring clean water to our rivers, streams and oceans. Now that clean water is again under attack by the new administration, the [replica Hudson River sloop will be sailing to Washington DC](http://www.clearwater.org/latest-news/sail-on-washington/) with an expected arrival of June 18.  

The mission of the sail is to carry a “cargo of concern” felt by New Yorkers and Americans alike for clean water and science-based federal water policy. The *Clearwater* will be joined by representatives of various environmental groups and state, county and local officials as they carry their message to the nation’s capital.

The non-profit organization which built the *Clearwater* was founded by activist and folks singer Pete Seeger and his wife Toshi Seeger. The Seegers and the Clearwater organization played a pivotal role in the passage of the [Clean Water Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Water_Act;) of 1972. The Clean Water Act (CWA) is still the primary federal law in the United States governing water pollution.

From the [*Clearwater* website](http://www.clearwater.org/latest-news/sail-on-washington/):

*The Hudson River Sloop Clearwater is sailing to our nation’s capital to deliver a message from our members and supporters- in the Hudson Valley and across the country- that we…*

*   *Stand for clean water and healthy rivers.*
*   *Cannot return to the days of dead rivers, choking air, and toxic waste.*
*   *Need federal agencies, like the EPA, that enforce the regulations that are protecting public health and safety.*
*   *Believe that environmental policy needs to be based on sound science.*
*   *Understand that climate change is a major threat to the ecology, the economy and the security of the nation and urgent action must be taken to address it.*
*   *Know that pollution is an environmental justice issue, often harming the most vulnerable communities among us the most.*
*   *Want a sustainable world for our children and for future generations.*
*   *All our waters are connected.  All our waters must be protected.*
