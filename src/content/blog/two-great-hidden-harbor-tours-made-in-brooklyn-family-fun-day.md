![hhtours1](https://old-salt-blog-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/06/hhtours1.jpg)If you are near New York harbor, the [Working Harbor Committee](http://workingharbor.com/) Hidden Harbor Tours® has two great new tours coming up — “**Made in Brooklyn**” on Thursday, June 11th, and a “**Family Fun Day Boat Tour**” on Saturday, June 20th.

“**Made in Brooklyn**” — Join Working Harbor Committee for a tour of Brooklyn waterfront industry, past and present. From Newtown Creek through Sunset Park, the 8 miles of Brooklyn shore facing the Harbor’s Upper Bay were once filled with manufacturing, shipping, and commerce. Highlights include Brooklyn Navy Yard, the city’s new waterfront recycling facility at Gowanus Bay, and the working rail-to-barge connection at Brooklyn Army Terminal. The tour is narrated by Newtown Creek Alliance Historian Mitch Waxman and Captain Margaret Flanagan, Maritime Operations, Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance. The 2-hour boat tour departs at 6:00pm sharp. Boarding begins at 5:30pm.  [Click here for tickets.](http://www.nycharities.org/events/EventLevels.aspx?ETID=8229)

“**Family Fun Day Boat Tour**” — See Giant Container Ports Close-up Plus Ships, Tugboats, Cranes, a Lighthouse, and the Statue of Liberty! For an exciting, fun-filled family adventure, go behind the scenes of the NY & NJ’s bustling working waterfront on a narrated Hidden Harbor® “Maritime Scavenger Hunt” Tour!

Children will get a workbook they will use to identify things seen in our working waterfront as we cruise to Port Newark/Elizabeth Marine terminal. See that tugboat? Check if off in your book! A lighthouse? A container vessel? The Statue of Liberty? At the end of the tour a maritime expert on board will sign the booklet to “certify” the child has been made an “honorary Captain.” Sandwiches and beverages available for purchase on board. The 2-hour (11AM-1 PM) fully-narrated boat tour departs at 11Am sharp. Boarding begins at 10:30AM. [Click here for tickets](http://www.nycharities.org/events/EventLevels.aspx?ETID=8239).

**Both tours depart from Pier 11 Wall Street** in Manhattan, located on South St. between Wall St. & Gouveneur Lane. Snack bar on board. Tickets: $30; $25 seniors; $15 Children 12 years & under. For group sale rates, email workingharbor@aol.com
