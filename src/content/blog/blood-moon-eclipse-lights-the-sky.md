We posted recently about a rare [lunar eclipse tetrad](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2014/04/rare-total-lunar-eclipse-tetrad-beginning-this-month-across-us/), a sequence of four total lunar eclipses, each six months apart.  The first of these total lunar eclipses was last night around 2:30 AM EST. I confess. I didn’t stay up. Fortunately others did and here is a wonderful selection of photos of the eclipse from around the world. During a total eclipse, the moon takes on a red to orange appearance due to [Rayleigh scattering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering) (which is also why the sky appears to be blue.) Because of this red tint, a moon in eclipse is often referred to as a “blood moon.”
