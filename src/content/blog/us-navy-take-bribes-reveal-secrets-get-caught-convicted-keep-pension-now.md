![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gilbeau.jpg)Last June, [Rear Admiral Robert Gilbeau](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/09/481475338/u-s-rear-admiral-pleads-guilty-in-fat-leonard-navy-bribery-and-fraud-case) became the first active duty admiral in modern times to plead guilty to a felony. He will be sentenced next month and faces up to five years in Federal prison for charges related the massive [“Fat Leonard” bribery scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Leonard_scandal). Despite his conviction Gilbeau and six other senior officers convicted in the scandal are still collecting their full pensions from the Navy. Gilbeau’s pension is reported to be approximately $120,000 per year.  Whether the seven continue to receive their pensions will be up to the courts and the Navy.

As reported by the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/navy-officers-convicted-of-corruption-in-fat-leonard-scandal-havent-lost-their-pensions/2017/03/18/d60c6d4c-0363-11e7-b1e9-a05d3c21f7cf_story.html?utm_term=.022dbae9da98): “*Gilbeau is one of seven current or former Navy officers who have pleaded guilty in an epic corruption and bribery scandal but are still eligible for generous retirement benefits, courtesy of U.S. taxpayers.*

*In exceptionally rare cases, military officers who are sentenced to prison or classified as deserters can be “dropped from the rolls” — the harshest category of discharge — and their rank, privileges and benefits erased completely.*

*“Over the past decade, the Navy has dropped just four reserve officers from the rolls. Among them were a murderer, a drug dealer and a child pornographer….*

*“Military legal experts said the Navy may be waiting until any potential criminal appeals from the officers are finalized. Under the law, officers can be dropped from the rolls only after all appeals are exhausted — a process that could take years.*”

Ultimately, it is up to the Navy’s discretion was to whether or not officers convicted in the scandal retain their pensions.    

Thus far, a total of 20 current or former U.S. Navy officials have been charged with corruption and fraud related to Glenn Defense Marine Asia (GDMA), which was run by Leonard Glen Francis, known as “Fat Leonard.”  Five GDMA executives have also been charged. To date, 13, including one other Rear Admiral, have pleaded guilty while several other cases are pending.

The Navy has said that 200 people are still under investigation, including thirty current or retired admirals. The [scandal has been described as being the worst to hit the Navy since the end of the Cold War](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/12/waves-fat-leonard-bribery-scandal-continue-rock-navy/).
