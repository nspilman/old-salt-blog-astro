The visiting tall ships have started arriving in New York’s outer harbor.  Tomorrow morning at just after 8 in the morning, the “Parade of Sail” will form up at the Verazano Narrows Bridge and stand north into the inner harbor past the Statue of Liberty and up the Hudson River as far as the George Washington Bridge, followed at around 10:40 by a   “Military Parade of Ships.”   There should be good view spots on both sides of the river from the the Battery North to the GW Bridge on the Manhattan side and from Liberty State Park, Jersey City, Hoboken and Weehawken up to Fort Lee on the New Jersey shore.

Ships will be open for visitors starting Thursday on Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island. In general, the Manhattan and Staten Island ships will be open from Thursday through Tuesday while the ships in Brooklyn will be open Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.  For detailed schedules and locations see [Opsail – New York](http://www.opsail.org/popup-new-york)  and [Fleet Week New York.](http://www.fleetweeknewyork.com/events.html)
