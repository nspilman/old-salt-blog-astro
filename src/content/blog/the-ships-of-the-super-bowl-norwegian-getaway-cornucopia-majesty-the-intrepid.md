Super Bowl Fever has taken over New York and New Jersey.  (Personally, I am sick of it and we are still two days away from the game.) Football fans are swarming all over, on both sides of New York harbor. Four thousand of those fans are staying on NCL’s brand new cruise ship, the gaudily painted 1,063 feet long [*Norwegian Getaway*.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Getaway)  It has been chartered as the “Bud Light Hotel.” This is not the first time that Budweiser has taken over a hotel for Super Bowl, but it is the first time it has chartered a ship. The ship has a passenger capacity comparable to the largest New York City hotels and larger than any hotel in new Jersey.  As reported by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/nyregion/welcome-or-not-4000-football-fans-will-be-afloat-at-a-hudson-river-pier.html?_r=0):

*The ship is the fifth Bud Light Hotel, and the largest. Anheuser-Busch officials boasted when they announced plans for the ship that they could accommodate 10 times as many people as in past hotels in Super Bowl cities. It said the guests would include consumers who had won Super Bowl-related contests, along with retailers and people the company described as its invited “business partners.”*

The *Norwegian Getaway* is tied up alongside the [Intrepid Air and Space Museum](http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/). Events are planned on Pier 49, on local streets and on the aircraft carrier *[Intrepid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Intrepid_\(CV-11\)).*

*They will not spend all their time on Norwegian Getaway — there is the game, of course, and many on board will presumably disembark on Feb. 2 for the journey to MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. But they can clamber off the ship before that. Bud Light is also taking over the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, a World War II-era aircraft carrier docked at the pier next door. And Bud Light has put up a tent in a parking lot across 12th Avenue from the Intrepid.*

The two football teams, the Broncos and the Seahawks, are staying at water front hotels in Jersey City.  The Denver Broncos chartered the 210 foot long luxury party ship [*Cornucopia Majesty*](http://www.newsday.com/sports/football/glauber-s-nfl-hot-reads-1.811959/nfl-goes-aboard-the-cornucopia-majesty-1.6887495) for media events and parties.  Let’s hope the Broncos are better football players than they are sailors.  There have been complaints about the ship’s motion, tied up alongside the dock on the Hudson River in Jersey City.

*During their media availability with reporters aboard this 210-foot luxury liner Wednesday morning, the Broncos noticed that the vessel was swaying even though it was moored to the pier adjoining the team hotel.*  *Someone – or something – was rocking the boat. And the Broncos weren’t happy about it.*

*“I feel like I’m going to throw up,” tight end Jacob Tamme said, just moments after sitting down at a table with backup quarterbacks Brock Osweiler and Zac Dysert in preparation for the interview period.*
