My family and I got away to Roatan in the Bay Islands of Honduras for a week of  [diving](http://www.cocoviewresort.com/).  Here is a short clip of diving with Caribbean reef sharks. There were only three sharks, but that was enough to hold my attention.  On a related topic, nations meeting at the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species earlier this month  [voted down a proposal to protect several species of sharks](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/science/earth/24shark.html?src=me).   In addition to be being feared and hated, many species of sharks are also now endanged.
