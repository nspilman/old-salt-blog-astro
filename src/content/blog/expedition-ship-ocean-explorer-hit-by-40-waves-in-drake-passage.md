![](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/drakepassageoceanexplorer.jpg)[Quark Expeditions](https://www.quarkexpeditions.com/) bills it as “[The Ultimate Drake Passage Cruise](https://www.quarkexpeditions.com/blog/the-ultimate-drake-passage-cruise)” and it appears that passengers aboard Quark’s expedition cruise ship [*Ocean Explorer*](https://www.quarkexpeditions.com/expedition-ships/ocean-explorer) got their money’s worth as the ship was slammed by 30-to-40-foot waves in its crossing of the notorious [Drake Passage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Passage), between the tip of South America and Antarctica. Fortunately, there were no reports of damage to the ship or injuries to those aboard.

[Lesley Anne Murphy](https://www.instagram.com/lesleyannemurphy/), a travel blogger, [captured footage](https://www.instagram.com/lesleyannemurphy/reel/DHrqTE4xEzv/) showing passengers falling into walls and sliding across the floor as giant waves crashed into the vessel during a return trip from Antarctica.

Murphy estimated some waves were 30 to 40 feet. The ship’s unique design, including paneled windows, allows passengers to see waves coming. 

In the caption of Murphy’s [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/lesleyannemurphy/reel/DHrqTE4xEzv/), she described the experience as a 48-hour roller coaster.

“I am proud to say we survived not one but two Drake Shakes,” she said. “If you’re lucky, you get the ‘Drake Lake.’ If you’re like us, you get the ‘Drake Shake’ with 35-foot waves.”
