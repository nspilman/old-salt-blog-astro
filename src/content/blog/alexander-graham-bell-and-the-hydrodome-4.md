Bell’s HD-4

Most of us think of [Alexander Graham Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell#Later_inventions) as the inventor of the telephone, as indeed he was. He was also an early pioneer in hydrofoil boats. His hydrofoil, [Hydrodome #4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD-4), better known as the HD-4, set a world marine speed record in 1919.

Bell was not the first to develop a hydrofoil craft. Italian inventor [Enrico Forlanini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Forlanini#Tim) began work on hydrofoils in 1898. Bell and engineer Casey Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy in 1911 and rode in Forlanini’s hydrofoil boat on Lake Maggiore. The craft used a ladder system of foils and was powered by a 60 hp (45 kW) engine driving two counter-rotating air propellers. It had a top speed of 68 km/h (42.5 mph).

Bell’s HD-4 was considerably larger and more powerful than Forlanini’s hydrofoil. Assisted in the design by Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and boat builder, Bell’s HD-4 used a ladder type foil system and was powered by two 350 HP Liberty V-12 engines. On September 9, 1919, on the Bras d’Or Lakes, at Baddeck, Nova Scotia,  HD-4 set a world marine speed record of 70.86 miles per hour (114.04 km/h).  The video below shows the HD-4 in operation.
