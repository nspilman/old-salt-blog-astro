Cranes attempting to salvage chemical tank barge Waldhof

An update to a [post from last week](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/01/23/blocked-rhine-river-sulphuric-acid-barge-at-the-lorelei-rock/):   A backlog of close to 400 ships is still bottled up on the Rhine River following the capsizing of the 110M chemical tank barge, *Waldhof,* on January 13th  near the Lorelei Rock.  The  *Waldhof* is carrying 2,400 tonnes of sulfuric acid.

*Nearly three weeks after the chemical tanker Waldhof capsized in the Rhine River, a backlog of up to 400 ships are waiting to travel down the vital waterway.*

*Some ship owners are threatened with bankruptcy as their vessels are prevented from travelling past the wreck of the Waldhof near the famed Loreley rock.*

*They are instead stuck upriver of the accident site, either at Ludwigshafen or Mannheim. “We have not experienced such a situation for decades,” said a spokesman for ship owners.*

*Efforts to salvage the chemical tanker are proceeding only very slowly, with the down-river passage of the Rhine expected to be closed to traffic for at least another week.*

*Experts were busy drilling into the seven tanks of the 110-metre-long Waldhof at the weekend to pump out the sulphuric acid it was carrying when it hit trouble on January 13 and turned over, killing two crew.*
