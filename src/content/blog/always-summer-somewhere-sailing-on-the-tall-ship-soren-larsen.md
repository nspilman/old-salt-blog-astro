![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/soren1.jpg)In response to our post, [Sail this summer on the Picton Castle](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2011/02/05/sail-this-summer-on-the-picton-castle/), Greg Winter commented, *“Or try the same in the beautiful South Pacific, on the brigantine [Soren Larsen](http://www.sorenlarsen.co.nz/). Sails out of Auckland New Zealand to the Cook Islands, Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Australia.*”    During the ugly winter we have been having, it is easy to forget that it is always summer somewhere.    The beautiful *Soren Larsen* is offering a wide range of cruises during the reset of the New Zealand Summer and Fall and escapes to the balmier  sections of the Pacific in Winter.
