![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/coldfusion.jpg)In recent weeks there been considerable interest generated by an application for a [patent filed by the US Navy for a compact cold fusion nuclear reactor](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a29427713/navy-compact-fusion-reactor/). For decades, “[cold fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion)” has been the holy grail of clean energy research. Progress was being made but the great breakthrough was always 25 or 50 years away, receding into the future like a shimmering chimera. If the Navy really has the secret of cold fusion, the ability to harness the power of the stars in a stable and compact space, it could literally change the world. 

From what can be seen in the patent application, (and so far it is only an application. A patent has not been granted) there is considerable work to be done before the device is workable, if it ever is.  One other thing is notable about the application. As reported by the [War Zone](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/30256/scientist-behind-the-navys-ufo-patents-has-now-filed-one-for-a-compact-fusion-reactor), “This latest design is the brainchild of the elusive [Salvatore Cezar Pais](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Salvatore+Cezar+Pais).”

[War Zone](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28729/docs-show-navy-got-ufo-patent-granted-by-warning-of-similar-chinese-tech-advances) also reports that *Pais is named as the inventor on four separate patents for which the U.S. Navy is the assignee: a curiously-shaped “[High Frequency Gravitational Wave Generator](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/en?inventor=Salvatore+Pais&oq=inventor:\(Salvatore+Pais\));” a [room-temperature superconductor](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190058105A1/en?inventor=Salvatore+Pais&oq=inventor:\(Salvatore+Pais\)); an [electromagnetic ‘force field’ generator](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10135366B2/en?inventor=Salvatore+Pais&oq=inventor:\(Salvatore+Pais\)) that could deflect asteroids; and, perhaps the strangest of all, one titled “[Craft Using An Inertial Mass Reduction Device](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en?inventor=Salvatore+Pais&oq=inventor:\(Salvatore+Pais\)).”*

*The United States Secretary of Navy is listed as the assignee on several radical aviation technologies patented by an aerospace engineer working at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) headquarters in Patuxent River, Maryland. One of these patents describes a “hybrid aerospace-underwater craft” claimed to be capable of truly extraordinary feats of speed and maneuverability in air, water, and outer space alike thanks to a revolutionary electromagnetic propulsion system.* 

*Sound far fetched? You’re not alone.* 

*A primary patent examiner at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) thought so too. But then the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of the Naval Aviation Enterprise personally wrote a letter addressed to the examiner claiming that the U.S. needs the patent as the Chinese are already “investing significantly” in these aerospace technologies that sound eerily similar to the UFOs reported by Navy pilots in now well-known encounters. This raises the question, are the Chinese developing or even already flying craft leveraging similar advanced technology and is the Navy now scrambling to catch up?*

We recently [posted about the Navy’s confirmation of gun cam videos of UFOs or UAPs](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/11/uss-nimitz-uss-roosevelt-the-giant-tic-tacs-navy-videos-of-unexplained-aerial-phenomena/) (Unexplained Aerial Phenomena).

[Jurica Dujmović writing in Market Watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-a-believable-explanation-of-those-ufo-videos-released-by-the-navy-2019-10-15) speculates on the nature of the UAPs. “*A Navy experimental aircraft, inadvertently uncovered by pilots, or an alien UFO? My bet is on the latest Navy patent, but I’m open to suggestions.*”

Are we on the verge of virtually free, clean energy as well as seemingly impossible near forms of aerial and underwater craft?  Is Salvatore Cezar Pais the new Einstein or a crackpot? Practical cold fusion has been promised more than once.  Electromagnetic spacecraft, on the other hand, seem more figments of science fiction. Time will tell. Probably best not to hold one’s breath.
