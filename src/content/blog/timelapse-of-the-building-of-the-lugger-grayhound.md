Perhaps if I worked as fast as the folks in this video, I might get something done.

Thanks to [Alaric Bond](http://www.alaricbond.com/index.php) for passing along the link to the building of the lugger Grayhound. In [March of 2010, we posted about the lugger *Spirit of Mystery*](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2010/03/06/spirit-of-mystery-returning-home/) returning home to Cornwall after recreating the epic voyage by seven Cornishmen, several of whom had never been out of sight of land, who set sail in 1854 bound for the gold fields of Australia in *Mystery*, a 37′ Mounts Bay Lugger. The building of the [lugger Grayhound](http://grayhoundlugger.blogspot.com/) is being directed by Chris Rees who led the building of *Spirit of Mystery*. The new lugger is a based on a 158 ton vessel built in 1776 by a boat builder from Cawsand, John Parkin. There is some mystery as to the full history of the vessel, but it is known she acted as both excise vessel and privateer.

The construction should take about 18 months to complete with a further year of fitting out.
