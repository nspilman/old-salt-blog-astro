![](http://www.oldsaltblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mscgayane.jpg)In June 2019, Federal authorities [raided the container ship MSC *Gayane*](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2019/06/the-bizarre-smuggling-scheme-on-msc-gayane/) when the ship docked in Philadephia. They found and seized 20 tonnes of cocaine, worth over a billion dollars, stashed in shipping containers. The seizure was the largest cocaine bust in US history. Eight of the ship’s crew, including the Chief Mate, were arrested and [subsequently convicted](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/20-tons-of-coke-40-years-in-prison-for-msc-container-ship-crew) on drug smuggling charges.

Last Sunday, mafia boss, Goran Gogic, 43, was arrested as he attempted to board an international flight from Miami International Airport.  Gogic, a citizen of Montenegro, and a former heavyweight boxer, has been charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act and three counts of violating the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act.

He is alleged to be one of the masterminds behind a string of cocaine shipments from South America, including three busts by American authorities on box ships operated by MSC, including the record haul found on the MSC *Gayane.*

“The arrest and indictment of Gogic, a former boxer allegedly responsible for trafficking a staggering amount of cocaine, more than 20 tons, which he attempted to move through US ports, is a resounding victory for law enforcement,” stated United States attorney Breon Peace. “The meticulous planning by the defendant and his co-conspirators failed to take into account the federal agents whose hard work resulted in this body blow to the organization and individuals responsible for distributing massive quantities of cocaine.”

“Gogic, as alleged, is a major drug trafficker who, along with his criminal associates, is responsible for overseeing long-range narcotics transportation on containerships as well as the wholesale distribution of cocaine throughout Europe. Today’s arrest sends a message to narcotraffickers worldwide that they are not free to hijack international maritime commerce with impunity,” stated Ivan Arvelo, special agent-in-charge at Homeland Security Investigations.

MSC saw its Customs Trade Partnership (C-TPAT) certification suspended in the US following the series of drugs busts on its ships, which also involved a number of seafarers from Montenegro.

“A billion dollars’ worth of cocaine seized was a heavy hit for Gogic’s criminal network, but nothing heavier than his arrest last night,” said Frank Tarentino, special agent-in-charge at the Drug Enforcement Administration.

[Splash247.com](https://splash247.com/montenegrin-lynchpin-apprehended-in-msc-cocaine-case/) reports the case against Gogic states that his team loaded drugs onto MSC ships at night near the coast and ports, working with crewmembers who would hoist loads of cocaine from speedboats that approached the ships at multiple points along their route. To physically load the cocaine aboard, they used the ship’s cranes as well as nets. Once the cocaine was onboard, the crewmembers would hide it within specific shipping containers that they knew had sufficient room to conceal the large quantities of cocaine and for which they had duplicate counterfeit seals. They selected the specific containers to be used to conceal the cocaine based, in part, on the containers’ location and orientation, and route and destination onboard the vessel.

If convicted, Gogic faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and up to life in prison.
