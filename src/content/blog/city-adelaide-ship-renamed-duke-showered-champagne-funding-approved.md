The *City of Adelaide* was recently moved by barge from Irvine, Scotland.  She will now be taken to a port in Europe where she will be loaded on a heavy-lift ship for transport to her namesake port in Australia. Until recently, the funding for the transport was in question. Only in the last few days has the new Australian government confirmed that it will fund the $850,000 to fund part of the shipping fees.  The government largess, is however, rather limited.  The funding is subject to an agreement that the Commonwealth will not provide any further money for the project.
