I have photographs of the graves of those lost from HMS Kent these in the Falklands Islands Cemetery at Stanley, I would offer to post them, I have made offers in the past on various maritime matters unfortunately neither Rick or anyone else has  answered previously, I say again how.</p>\n",

My first impression would be to steer clear of any naval engagement.  The crew and the cargo are worth more than that of curiosity.</p>\n",
