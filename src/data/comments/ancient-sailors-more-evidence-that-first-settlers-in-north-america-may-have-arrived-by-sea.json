Turtle Island was not discovered by Asians, European or Polynesians. Turtle Island was inhabited by the First Nations, Native Americans and as such couldn&#8217;t be &#8220;discovered&#8221;. Maybe explored by these outsiders is a good way to say it. Also ask some Natives and they will tell you that we came by boat.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>I noticed that this story ignores that there once was a giant lake at one time that covered much of the Pacific North West.  Such a lake would have had mariners that would have gone fishing on it.  My schooling in high school told us that the lake at one time covered much of Washington to Idaho.  Most of Utah and Nevada were under water from the giant lake.  The water eventually leaked out of the grand canyon and the columbia river.</p>\n<p>Having such a lake would have had mariners.  Yet doesnt mean they were what settled North America.  This on the premise of Idaho having had mariners</p>\n",
