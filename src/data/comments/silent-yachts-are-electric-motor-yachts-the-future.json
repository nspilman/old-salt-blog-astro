    "content": "<p>My impression of solar power to batteries.  It takes more panels of a factor by 10 to create the offset used by an electric motor.  So unnless they are using the motors only at night with a genset?  The solar panels just wont be able to keep up with the demand of the batteries for recharge.</p>\n<p>These yachts to me appear to be great if your doing a short haul like Marina Del Rey to Catalina.  Yet to go to Hawaii the energy just isnt there.</p>\n",
