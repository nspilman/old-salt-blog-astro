Here is an account of the attack from one of the links in the post:  </p>\n<p>&#8220;A huge towering explosion lit up the night sky and the cargo of oil quickly caught fire and spread across the water. Residents from the Hamptons on Long Island could see the fire at sea 27 miles away and alerted the authorities. At 09.59 hours, a coup de grâce was fired from a stern torpedo tube that struck the tanker on starboard side underneath the funnel in #6 main tank and caused the ship to settle fast by the stern, striking the seafloor after five minutes.&#8221;</p>\n",
