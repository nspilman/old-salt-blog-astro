    "content": "<p>Thamesport (on the River Medway) lost out big time to London Gateway, it used to be a thriving container port with new roads built to support the amount of truck traffic. It is now virtually empty.<br />\nI was surprised that London Gateway became such a success as it came online just as the deep water North Edinburgh Channel (through the sands of the Thames Estuary) silted up and was no longer navigable causing deep draft vessels to have to go the extra distance up to the Sunk gyratory and back which is right by Felixtowe Port.</p>\n",
