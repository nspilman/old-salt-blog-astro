These centers include NOAA’s Center for Weather and Climate Prediction in College Park, Maryland, which contains the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) used for day-to-day weather forecasting and modeling; as well as the the NWS’s Radar Operations Center (ROC) located in Norman, Oklahoma, which works towards the development, maintenance, and training for the Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) Network.</p>\n",
