    "content": "<p>One of the big &#8216;takeaways&#8217; of the day was how unplanned the arrival of the civilian rescue boats were. They immediately responded, without waiting for CG or NYP direction, in response to the almost universal creed of mariners to provide aid to save lives.  It was this same impulse that had been previously seen during the 9/11 marine evacuation from downtown Manhattan. We can look back at those efforts with pride and cheers today, but hopefully their completely unselfish actions will continue forever even without such acknowledgement.</p>\n",
