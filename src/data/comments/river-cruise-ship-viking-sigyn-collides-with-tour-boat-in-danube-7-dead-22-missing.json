    "content": "<p>Viking Cruises might do well to review its operating protocols and Watchkeeping practices most particularly with inclement weather conditions. This is the yet another serious situation the company has had.<br />\nIf one looks at the layout of these river cruise vessels the Bridge is situated about one third of the vessel aft from the bow.  Looking out through the Bridge windows forward is the Sun deck complete with umbrellas, refer to the company river brochure, thus the forward visibility is restricted.  In this recent incident the Viking vessel overran the smaller cruise vessel which sank with loss of life.  It is quite possible that the Watchkeeper missed seeing the small cruise vessel due to restricted visibility.  </p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",
