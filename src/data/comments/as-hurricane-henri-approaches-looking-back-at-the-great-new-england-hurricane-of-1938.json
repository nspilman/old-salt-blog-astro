At the time of this post little if any rain has fallen on the east sidee of the storm.  The bulk of the rain is falling on the western edge of the storm.  Henri might go up the hudson river and follow the Saint John River.  Bay of Fundy is much too cold.  Our summer has not been warm enough to heat it up.</p>\n<p>Henri was originally predicted to leave here Wednesday morning.  It might still bee here by then.  Even the fishermen arent bothering to move their boats to the shelter of Long Cove.</p>\n",
