    "content": "<p>While I doubt this had much to do with Bezos directly and was a proposed arrangement by the shipyard for dramatic effect. One doubts that the Rotterdam City Council in fact would have allowed the dismantling.  </p>\n<p>The Dutch farmers are annoyed with the EU and are blockading the roads in the Netherlands.  In turn this has caused problems for the transfer of the Tour de France equipment and personnel to France from Denmark.  A fleet of trucks will travel some 1000 kms and six flights have been chartered to accomplish this transfer.  One would have thought chartering a ferry (a non-autonomous one!!) to make the transfer by sea would have been much simpler. </p>\n<p>Ah well vive la france !</p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",
