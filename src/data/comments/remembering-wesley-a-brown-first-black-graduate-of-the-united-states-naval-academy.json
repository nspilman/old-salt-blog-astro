    "content": "<p>Thanks very much for including Wesley Brown in your Black History Month coverage. He was a friends of my parents and had dinner at our house quite a bit, including Seders. My father insisted we only call him Mr. Brown.<br />\nI;m a retired journalist, and about 20 years ago, I called Mr. Brown with the idea of writing his biography. He turned me down, though, when I told him I wanted to write about the pervasive racism he faced in the Navy, telling me &#8220;I only want to think about the good things.&#8221;<br />\nThe man was a giant. It was Mr. Brown who paved the way for Colin Powell and all the senior Black officers, and Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs, who followed him. He should have made admiral, and would have, if he hadn&#8217;t been who he was.</p>\n",
