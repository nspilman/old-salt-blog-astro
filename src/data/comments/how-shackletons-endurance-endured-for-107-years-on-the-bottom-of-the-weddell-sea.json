Years after reading about it I still find it astounding that Hurley actually dove into the crumbling ship to retrieve cans of exposed film he&#8217;d wisely soldered closed.</p>\n<p>And no cozy place for Hurley to warm up afterwards. Sometimes it seems as though people of those days were another species entirely.</p>\n",
