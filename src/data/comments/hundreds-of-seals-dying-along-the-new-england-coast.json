    "content": "<p>I believe Joe is trying to note that a population of 71,000 seals hardly merits the need of a NOAA scare tactic for 600 seals.  Or at least that is my take on Joes view.  The better questioion omtted by the above story is where in particular in Maine is the die off happening?  Is it near a particular area?  Are factories possibly to blame?  Tourist boats, as there has been a large concern that these monolithic tourism boats may be the cause for many things.</p>\n<p>Yet 600 seals could have died in Portland area alone.  The other thing is since Obama left office.  Many government agencies have been trimmed.  These said agencies are doing &#8220;shock and awe&#8221; practices to get funding back.</p>\n",
