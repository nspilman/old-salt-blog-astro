    "content": "<p>Alas all these plans seem to overlook that the space around earth is highly contaminated with space junk.  A recent thought was to have a satellite destroyer to knock out or burnup the debris.  NASA and the Indian Space Agency launched an attack satellite.  It did work, yet posed greater risk to the International Space Station.  It seems they did destroy a larger satellite.  The (part I found humurous they didnt think about) destruction instead created over a thousand new particles that are more lethal than the one big one.  More interesting use of our tax dollars.</p>\n",
