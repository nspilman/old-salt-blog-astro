From the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%8Dry%C5%AB-class_submarine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Wikipedia page</a>:</p>\n<p>Japanese submarines since World War II were named after ocean currents. The JMSDF changed its naming convention with the Sōryū,[7] and submarines will now be named after mythological creatures. Sōryū (そうりゅう) means blue dragon in Japanese and shares its name with the World War II aircraft carrier Sōryū, sunk during the Battle of Midway.</p>\n",
