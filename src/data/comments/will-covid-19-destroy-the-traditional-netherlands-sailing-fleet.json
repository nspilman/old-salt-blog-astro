There&#8217;s a warm spot in my heart for the Dutch sailing fleet, since the historic Hudson River sloops that plied the river for hundreds of years owe much in design inspiration to the Dutch vessels. We can see that inspiration now in our proud sloop &#8220;Clearwater.&#8221;</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Whilst I admire the vessels I think some of the statements do not hold water.<br />\nThe vessels will still be there, maybe not as well maintained and Thames barges in the UK are also not publicly funded.<br />\nHowever, if any government funding is available I would rather it went to the historic vessels rather than the modern cruise ships. But I doubt the historic vessel owners are drinking buddies with those in power like the bosses of the Cruise industry.</p>\n",
