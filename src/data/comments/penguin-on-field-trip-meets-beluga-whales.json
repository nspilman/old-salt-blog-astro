It&#8217;s so large that the animals emerge from the transparency limit of the water (not shabby at all), approach the window appearing  quite small because there&#8217;s nothing in the tank to set scale.  When arriving at the window they loom ever so large, something that for some reason the video doesn&#8217;t quite capture.</p>\n<p>Breathtaking.</p>\n",
