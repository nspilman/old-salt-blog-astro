On any average day in summer, 2-3? 1-2, maybe. Something like that. </p>\n<p>Getting through my next kneejerk: so many calls sounds <i>terrible</i>, but after all that&#8217;s action covering the whole expanse between lower Puget Sound and Gulf Islands. Thousands of square miles, a <i>lot</i> of kayakers out and about on any given day. </p>\n<p>Most kayakers are having an unalloyed good time. To the extent nobody is seriously hurt among the small fraction of kayakers who end up needing help, &#8220;the system works.&#8221; </p>\n<p>To my mind we should think of helping other boaters as being part of normal or at least expected sailing activites, even if not a regular occurrence.</p>\n<p>All calm again. 🙂 </p>\n<p>And to the present story, no matter how long the the guy clung to that buoy, it&#8217;s remarkably pleasant that his adventure ended well.</p>\n",
