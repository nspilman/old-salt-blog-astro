    "content": "<p>Yeah. That &#8216;s right. Throw the junior officer under the bus. There is only one person responsible for the collision. They call it CAPTAIN. That is why you pick your crew. If there isn&#8217;t a GENERAL COURT convened the Navy is doing the usual bullshit and picking on the monkey whilst the organ grinder gets a slap on the wrist. I was a Lt(jg) on an aircraft carrier and responsible for the most sensitive top secret documents. If I had screwed up, my skipper never would have made Admiral. In fact he would probably have been forced to retire. The Navy is now mirroring the nonsense that goes on in Washington with elected politicians and that is a pity.</p>\n",
