    "content": "<p>Sadly this is not the first time for maritime incidents with both of these companies.  In general car carriers tend to instability due to design factors and the rushed loading system leads to short cuts being taken.  This latter applies to Grimaldi ferries as well resulting in protocols not being followed.</p>\n<p>Until the companies themselves correct this problem there will be more incidents in the future.</p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",
