    "content": "<p>Quite frankly looking at this with the experience of over three decades as an Officer in passenger ships the operating companies are behaving extremely irresponsibly.  Taking just the crew of one of my ships we had 35 nationalities drawn from Far East, Middle East and European countries.  The first thing that should have been done was cancel the cruises and test all the crew members.  Perhaps most people are unaware that dozens even hundreds of crew members are changed each voyage due to various reasons such as leave rotations, transfers, illness and disciplinary causes.  Therefore any illness is transmitted around the world within 24 hours as these persons arrive and depart by air.<br />\nFor one cruise line to sail again with a full load of crew and passengers after the positive tests and a death amongst passengers from the previous cruise is criminal behavior. This is the same cruise line that had a ship quarantined in Japan and now has a ship quarantined off the coast of California, USA.  Thus we have once again a petri dish for the virus.<br />\nOne might ask why the ships Master sailed when a ship is supposed to be commanded by its Master.  Well those days are in practical fact long gone as economics control all concerned and cruise lines in particular are vicious in punishing any Master or Officer who goes against them.  Its good to be retired, no longer under any obligation to these operators and free to speak out.</p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",
