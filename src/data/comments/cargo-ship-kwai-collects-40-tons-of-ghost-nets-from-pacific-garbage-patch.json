    "content": "<p>An update is that Captain Brad actually sailed as Engineer on KWAI during Voyage 49 &#8212; which was the Plastics gathering cruise.    The actual captain was Ethan &#8212; whose last name I do not know.    Brad has initially owned and/or managed a Baltic Trader, than EDNA (subsequently wrecked on a Pacific atoll in different ownership) and now KWAI.  He has hundreds of thousands of nautical miles to his credit.   </p>\n<p>I read that Boyan&#8217;s Slat&#8217;s &#8220;oceans cleaning device&#8221; is back at sea and hope that it holds together this time.   Let us all hope that each and every possible device can be deployed to help clean up the mess that man has created in the oceans that cover so much of the earth.</p>\n",
