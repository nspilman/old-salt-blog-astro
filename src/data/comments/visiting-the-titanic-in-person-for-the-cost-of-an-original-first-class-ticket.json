It&#8217;s a common (and none-too-honest) tactic. I know a guy who&#8217;s always harping on the subject of homeschooling, who quotes a figure of $19K as the cost to educate a child in public school. That number is from (I believe) NYC, and is at least double the national median for various reasons, but he presents it as the cost nationwide because it suits his argument.</p>\n",
