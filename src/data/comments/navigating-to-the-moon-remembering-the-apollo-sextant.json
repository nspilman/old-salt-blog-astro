    "content": "<p>Excellent post about sextant use on the Apollo missions. I had no idea. Sure glad our navy started teaching celestial navigation again. There is no good reason not to and every reason to know how to do navigate this way and to have experience taking sights with a sextant and using tables. (Might I suggest to those who are sick of hearing about it that they turn off their TV, buy an inexpensive teaching sextant, and learn the basics.)</p>\n",
