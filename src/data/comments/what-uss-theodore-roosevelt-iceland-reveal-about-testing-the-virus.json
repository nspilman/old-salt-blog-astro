    "content": "<p>No problem with math. Just prose. The previous paragraph said that &#8220;60% of those who tested positive were asymptomatic.&#8221; I thought the following paragraph would be clear that those were the sailors being referred to. To avoid confusion I have updated the following paragraph to the read &#8220;That 60% of the crew who tested positive was infected and contagious &#8230;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even using 8% as the figure of contagious but asymptomatic explains why the virus spread from 3 sailors to 655 in such a short period of time. </p>\n",

I think this number better illustrates the communicability of the infection.</p>\n",
