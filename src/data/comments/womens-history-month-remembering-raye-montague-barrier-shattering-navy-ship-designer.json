    "content": "<p>An amazing children&#8217;s book about Raye Montague is &#8220;The Girl With a Mind for Math,&#8221; by Julia Finley Mosca. The cheerful but frank tone evokes the bravery and determination this brilliant woman used to counter racist barriers that sprung up right from the moment her desire to build ships was voiced. If you have a budding engineer or mathematician in your family, it is truly inspirational&#8211;and unlikely to be read without heartache.</p>\n",
