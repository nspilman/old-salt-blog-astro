When I saw this Old Salt Blog, the first thing that came to my mind is that those Little Brigs are just what is needed to make the Tall Ships Youth Trust  tall again and to deserve keeping the plural &#8220;s&#8221; in Tall Ships. They would not even need to raise funds if they just sold off their Bermudan-rigged aluminium-can yots and their catamaran. They could even rename the Little Brigs &#8220;Stavros S. Niarchos&#8221; and &#8220;Prince William&#8221;&#8230;</p>\n",

They are fundraising again looking for £5 million of which they are only looking at spending £2 million on ships. Tongue in cheek so to speak</p>\n",
