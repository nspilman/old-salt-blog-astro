Yet locals are seeing through the veil of corporate muscle and know that these purported jobs are only temporary.  The work will only be there until the job is done.  Then a vacuum will occur once the grid is established.  Also the jobs offered arent with training.  The corporate flex is only seeking experienced help.</p>\n",
