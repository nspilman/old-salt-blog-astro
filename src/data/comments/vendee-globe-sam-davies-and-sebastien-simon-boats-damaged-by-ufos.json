    "content": "<p>I agree John, the yachts are close to the Agulhas current which must be a likely candidate for dropped boxes in inclement weather. Another possibility is ghost nets from fishing vessels. Humans are a messy lot on a grand scale!<br />\nTo use a motor racing cliche these vessels arrive at the scene of the accident very quickly. But even at my Nic 32&#8217;s humble six knots max I would still hate to hit a floating container on a dark and stormy sea.</p>\n",
