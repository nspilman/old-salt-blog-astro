This was a retroactive discovery, however &#8211; at the time, they were thought to be a mutated type of the worldwide orca species.  While they share the black-and-white colouring and saddle patch patterns of other orcas, these orcas have shorter dorsal fins, rounder heads, and the smallest eye patches of any ecotype, giving them a very specific appearance.  Since then, there have only been a handful of sightings of this rare ecotype, but enough for researchers to realize they are a unique ecotype and not just a mutation.  They have been seen consuming Patagonian toothfish, but like the Ross Sea orcas, it is still unknown if they are fish specialists.<br />\n<a href=\"https://us.whales.org/meet-the-different-types-of-orcas/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://us.whales.org/meet-the-different-types-of-orcas/</a></p>\n",
