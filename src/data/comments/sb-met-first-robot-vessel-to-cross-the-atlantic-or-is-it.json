    "content": "<p>SB Met is the first unmanned boat to cross the Atlantic unassisted, and to arrive at its stated waypoint on the other side (there are unmanned, non-navigating sailboats that have crossed to random destinations).  Without diminishing the Slocum Glider achievement, it did not cross without assistance, and it finished hundreds of kms from land.  Its crossing did not conform to the rules created by either the Microtransat Race or that of Guinness World Records.  The record to cross unassisted by fully autonomous (SB Met was remotely controlled) boat still remains open.</p>\n",
