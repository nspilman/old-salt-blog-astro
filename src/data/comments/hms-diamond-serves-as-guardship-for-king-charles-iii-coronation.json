As the procession approached Buckingham Place the various squadrons had to change from a file of twelve to a file of six without holding up the parade. It was incredible but totally missed by the bonzo press. It can be found if you look for it, the Royal Navy absolutely nailed it but I cannot find recorded coverage anywhere.</p>\n<p>It is visible on this recording at 5:45:30 and the front of the procession at 5:37:00.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je_fcAfd5_g\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je_fcAfd5_g</a></p>\n<p>Saddest thing of all is these incredible military personnel were denied the opportunity to show their skills to a worldwide audience.</p>\n",
