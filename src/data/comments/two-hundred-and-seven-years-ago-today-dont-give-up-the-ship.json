    "content": "<p>As a not particularly militant American, I always feel saddened by the Schetky image of Shannon towing Chesapeake into Halifax. I suspect there are several iterations of this painting. A wealthy American friend owns one; I always feel compelled to tell him that it seems an ignominious piece for an American to display. But I guess at that point in the war the Royal Navy needed a win.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:John_Christian_Schetky,_H.M.S._Shannon_Leading_Her_Prize_the_American_Frigate_Chesapeake_into_Halifax_Harbour_(c._1830).jpg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:John_Christian_Schetky,_H.M.S._Shannon_Leading_Her_Prize_the_American_Frigate_Chesapeake_into_Halifax_Harbour_(c._1830).jpg</a></p>\n",

It&#8217;s a very detailed and gripping piece of writing and he shows  great admiration for Captain Lawrence and his crew. He obviously draws on ships logs for his reconstruction. Well worth ( yet another! ) read.</p>\n",
