    "content": "<p>This trip was accomplished in 1987 by adventurer Ned Gillette in the &#8220;Sea Tomato&#8221; (it was painted red), supported by National Geographic and other Corporate sponsors. There were three other crew members with Ned in a 28&#8242; vessel with sliding seats fore and aft and a central cabin. The boat had a sailing rig which I designed at MacDougalls Boat Yard on Cape Cod. We spent the winter of 1985 &#8211; 86 in Punta Arenas, Chile and the western archipelago  rowing and waiting for the ice along the Antarctic Peninsular to breakup , which it never did. The next year, 1987, with favorable ice conditions they sailed west on a nor-easter for two days before stowing the rig and rowing south, catching the westerly winds and currant.<br />\nThe trip started about 100 miles north of Cape Horn and they ended up on the Antarctic Peninsular approximately 5-6 miles from the planed landfall seven and a half days later. There were no support vessels in attendance and none of the crew were professional rowers.<br />\nThe vessel and crew were picked up on the Peninsular by the Argentine Navy as planed and the vessel is now used for rowing training and owned by the Argentine Navy in Punta Arenas, Chile</p>\n",
