    "content": "<p>There was probably* a bit of journalistic licence to make the story more appealing.<br />\nAfter all, as Doug says, where were the wife and kids and why weren&#8217;t they dialing 911?<br />\nWas the kayaker wearing a life jacket and PLB (personal locator beacon) and what was the water temperature? These are the sort of questions a good journalist should be investigating in order to instill safety into the minds of those who may also enjoy the hobby.<br />\nUK spelling and dial codes used because I have never been to Lake George although it does sound like a nice place to cruise, anchor in a secluded bay and get away from the rigours of modern life.</p>\n",
