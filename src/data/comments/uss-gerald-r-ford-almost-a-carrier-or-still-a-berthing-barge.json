    "content": "<p>The way it works on a new construction vessel the US Navy &#8216;buys&#8217; a space, a system that crosses multiple spaces (like the elevators), or a component made of multiple systems such as a reactor; from the shipyard when the Navy deems them to be operational given the design specs and finished with things such as painting (and cleaned), signage installed, etc..</p>\n<p>The shipyard crosses that item off its list and moves on to another item on its final approval checklist and sends the Navy a bill under the intitial contract for that space/system/component.  The issues being reported belong to the Navy as they signed off on the carrier in total, even with the known elevator issues and the sanitary system stoppages.  Now any work on the ship by General Dynamics or Raytheon for the DBR costs the Navy more money.  These are being incorrectly reported as cost over runs by the shipyard, they are not.  They are bad purchases by NAVSEA, who has a history of rushing new and highly complex systems into full blown production without bothering to completely test them; aided by GDs whose an expert in covering issues up to get the ship out the door.</p>\n<p>A great book on these issues is Running Critical: The Silent War, Rickover, and General Dynamics.  It is about subs, but same principles apply.</p>\n",
