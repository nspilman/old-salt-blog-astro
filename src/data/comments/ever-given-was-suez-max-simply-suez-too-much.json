As the owner does not have that money, I recommend that the owner abandons the ship and declares a Constructive Total Loss for H&amp;M underwriters to pay.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>hopefully the ship as well as the cargo are going to be released soon . Furtheron we have heard already about the paralell digging of a second suez canal partial under way , in construction . Wether these sort of ships are not well constructed or similar concerns , i will not be able to estimate . On the other hand , the anthropolists and the archeologists are going to jump one further question :<br />\nin the times before Christ there existed a canal , i think it was rom the Red Sea upwards . It got sanded (probably somewhere around these ages when the town of Nofretete vanished , the whole area of northern Africa turned from fruitable into sand areas), as nowadays sience has prooved .<br />\nWhy there are no plans to reshape the ancient route oncemore ? Guess , what would be the decision of a Hetith Leader in such a case , or the husband of Nofretete ?<br />\nBy the way , such building and construction efforts should reval a lot of places nearby the construction , where archeologists and anthropologists may show up their talents .</p>\n",
