No doubt he/she is sitting in the OOW Bridge chair at the centralized controls.</p>\n<p>However that&#8217;s okay as he/she is most likely fast asleep after long cargo duty followed by Bridge Watch, in a comfortable chair, due to minimum crew manning in the first place. So it goes in the new world of shipping and a complacent IMO.  </p>\n<p>How nice one is long retired and no longer involved in training crew for seagoing.<br />\nMaybe after all it is safer on these High Seas to have unmanned ships !!</p>\n<p>Good Watch (if that computer understands that)</p>\n",
