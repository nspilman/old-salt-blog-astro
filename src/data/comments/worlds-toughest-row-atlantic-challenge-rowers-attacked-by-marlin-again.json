    "content": "<p>I venture to suggest that Zara Lachlan who was supported in setting up her attempt by the `Team Forces Foundation` and had recently completed a physics degree has completed the toughest challenge in her brilliant row mainland to mainland.</p>\n<p>21 year-old Zara Lachlan defied the odds to complete her historic, world first for an Atlantic row!</p>\n<p>On Saturday 1st February 2025 the English rower Zara Lachlan arrived in French Guiana after spending 97 days 9 hours and 20 minutes rowing across the Atlantic Ocean. By doing so Zara Lachlan has made history as the first female (and youngest person) to row solo, unsupported and non-stop leaving from mainland Europe to mainland South America a voyage of 3600nm 4143 miles. </p>\n<p>Zara`s historic row was not without incident; broken oars, personal injuries, broken coms, encounters with Orcas and sharks, and a near collision with a very large ship.</p>\n<p>On her arrival, Zara said: “It was just incredible to see land as I approached. It felt like it was not only the end of the journey but, the culmination of a longer mission to get me here, to prepare me for this challenge and then to take on the Atlantic – and make it!  It was tough. At some points really tough. But it’s in those moments you find out what you’re really made of. In many ways I didn’t really have a choice – I just had to grit my teeth and row.</p>\n<p>Regards</p>\n<p>Chris</p>\n",
