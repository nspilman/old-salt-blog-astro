The Laser debued there sailed by Canadian Olympic Funn champion Hans Fogh. I think it went out as the TGIF as the prototype had been built in a week. It was a success, Kirby wrote it up and it took off. The Windsurfer and the Hobie 14 had come out a little earlier but didn&#8217;t have the PR boost. Hard to do in the days before social media.</p>\n",
