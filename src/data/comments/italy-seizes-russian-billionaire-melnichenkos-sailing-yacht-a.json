They are in most cases manned by international crews whom, it is reported are departing ports and making passages. While they are no doubt following the instructions of their Management Company and/or Owner at least some of these passages have been made with AIS switched off.  </p>\n<p>Due to their size this is illegal under Maritime Law and therefore the Captains and Watchofficers are liable to have action taken against their Certificates of Competency regardless of the instructions given them.</p>\n<p>Good Watch.</p>\n",
