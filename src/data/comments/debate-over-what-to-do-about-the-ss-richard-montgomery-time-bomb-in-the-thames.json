They have now relocated to Liverpool which they obviously consider to be a safe distance for viewing the big bang and are managing VTS remotely. Our new esteemed Prime Minister, when he was Mayor of London, wanted to build an airport on land to be reclaimed just upstream. Just telling you this so you know you are not the only ones with an idiot in charge 🙂</p>\n",
