    "content": "<p>It was with deep concern even shock that one read the above comments regarding population control.  Is it now acceptable to reduce  by &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; ?  What is wrong with you people ?<br />\nHaving just celebrated my 83rd. birthday at Christmas I am without doubt a &#8220;geriatric&#8221; by the commenters standards.  Believe me I have no wish to be the subject of a &#8220;tricky&#8221; experiment nor have my grandchildren told they may not have children if they so wish.<br />\nHaving grown up in Europe during WW2 one remembers Nazi thinking and the savage work of the SS which we are seeing repeating itself in the New York area.<br />\nFor the sake of humanity think before you write these comments.  </p>\n<p>HAPPY AND BLESSED NEW YEAR AND NEW DECADE TO ALL OF YOU</p>\n",

How to let population ramp down in a gentle way, without leaving a bunch of geriatrics unable to feed themselves is tricky &#8211; and we do not have the time. With the recent COP-out of world leaders, the climate change process is now irreversible. Nature and Human nature will combine, through famines, war (incl. nuclear) and pestilence to reduce the human population to near nothing and quite likely to extinction which has been the lot of the dominant species in every geological mass extinction&#8230;</p>\n",
