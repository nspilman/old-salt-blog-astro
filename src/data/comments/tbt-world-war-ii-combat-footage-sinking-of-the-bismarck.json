    "content": "<p>There is a brilliant National Geographic series titled &#8220;Drain the oceans&#8221; that uses multi-beam, high resolution sonar to define the wreck. Bob Ballard discovered that when the Bismark hit the seabed, it went down a muddy slope bow first leaving a &#8220;wake&#8221; in the form of a trench behind it. The high def sonar shows it beautifully. It also shows the port rudder missing and the starboard rudder bent to 45⁰ demonstrating just how much trouble she was in. It also suggests she was scuttled rather than be captured.</p>\n<p>Other programmes show the seabed around Alcatraz and why it was so difficult to escape from and one programme details the area around Pearl Harbour and how America may actually have fired the first shot of the Pacific war.</p>\n<p>All fascinating stuff.</p>\n",
