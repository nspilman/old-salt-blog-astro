    "content": "<p>Yes welcome news but then I do not think this was widely known outside the maritime fraternity. VICTORY is being excellently restored and not before time. Unfortunately when the RN Museum took over the running of the warship WARRIOR the first think they did was to put in a very modern coffee shop into the Victorian Galley which somewhat destroyed the historical context. We in the UK are not as good as you are in the USA at doing reenactment within the operation of our museums, you have it right with costumed characters in period something we could learn from.</p>\n<p>Chris</p>\n",
