    "content": "<p>June 10 2018</p>\n<p>I live here on Pitcairn and I am trying to get my head around it all.<br />\nGrowing up, we were told about Mathew McCoy ramming the cannon with a stick and not knowing a nail was in the stick causing it to spark which mangled his arm and he later died of his injuries.One of these 2 cannons was spiked by the crew of the Bounty. Those cannons raised in 1845, one was taken to Norfolk Island, Our guys raised the 3rd Cannon in 1973 and the  Nigel Erskin team in 1998-1999.<br />\nIf it is a genuine Bounty cannon, it would be nice to have it back here in our PI museum.<br />\nMeralda Warren 7th Generation Bounty descendant</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>I can only add the following that is: In 1998 I visited Pitcairn with the sailing ship `Eye of the Wind&#8217; we dived the remains and saw ballast bars in rows and one cannon. It is my understanding that this cannon was raised a year or two later and was taken to Australia by conservators for conservation. I would suggest contact with the Island that would tell you when J R McCoy died, I am sure that the Island museum would be able to help solve the connection with Captain Stewart of the Orealla in 1898.<br />\nIncidentally William McCoy Bounty mutineer was a direct ancestor of my wife&#8217;s Aunt Janet McCoy she married John McCoy in 1946 her descendants live in Canada and are 9th generation.</p>\n",
