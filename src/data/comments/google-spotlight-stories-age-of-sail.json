    "content": "<p>What a great wee movie, thanks.</p>\n<p>Two of my favourite films are &#8220;Captains Courageous&#8221; with Freddy Bartholomew and Spencer Tracy about a boy falling of a cruise liner and being picked up by a Portuguese fisherman. There are some simillarities to this wee movie. The special effects when the mast breaks were real and the film of the schooners is fantastic. I bought it on Amazon for a few quid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captains_Courageous_(1937_film)\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captains_Courageous_(1937_film)</a></p>\n<p>Also, &#8220;Down to the Sea in Ships&#8221; with Richard Widmark. Another coming of age movie.</p>\n",
