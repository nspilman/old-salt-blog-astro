    "content": "<p>Indeed Peter from Peter !!  This is a good Captain making a poor decision going past the chain of command but understandable when looking after his crew.  Clearly this was also a hasty decision by the Acting SECNAV who may well be dismissed himself.  One feels the CO felt there was not a very positive response to his chain of command communications about the rapidly developing situation with COVID-19 on board his ship.  There was an interview with General Keene a retired USAF officer who explained all sides of the incident excellently.  One has no doubt it will be sorted out and the Captain given a new posting but not a ship commend.</p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",
