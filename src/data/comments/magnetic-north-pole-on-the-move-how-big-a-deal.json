Oddly enough, the NOAA charts use &#8220;variation&#8221; based on the World Magnetic Model (WMM) while the NOAA National Center for Environmental Information (NCIE) and the folks who generate the WMM from which the charts are updated prefer &#8220;declination.&#8221; The NOAA<br />\n phone compass app also uses declination.
