But alas the world wasn&#8217;t what we thought it was at that age. I remember the TV shows of Sea Hunt, Bold Journey, Jacques Cousteau, The World at War, there are a few more that I can&#8217;t remember. Now I&#8217;m 71 been stationed from Germany to Korea see the horrors of war in the Gulf and watching again as our World slowly edges toward War. But I remember the good times of the 50&#8217;s and early 60&#8217;s and even the 70&#8217;s weren&#8217;t to bad. Just have to go with the flow my friends.</p>\n",
