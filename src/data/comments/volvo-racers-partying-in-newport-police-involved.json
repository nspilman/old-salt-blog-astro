    "content": "<p>In my 20s among the young sailing set there was a jock mentality and the inflated egos of excellent sailors among them of course. I was not one of the elite accomplished sailors. I was more of a winch grinder than a foredeck jock. But I was a partier among them and moderation was not the style. I can imagine after circumnavigating the world sailing on the ragged edge you would take the opportunity to blow off steam and celibrate. Excess is part of that and of course you have god like status in your own mind. So, no surprise. I am envious of their adventure.</p>\n",
