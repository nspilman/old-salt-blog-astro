    "content": "<p>This is a deeply troubling report. Using unproven allegations, especially of such serious nature, without due process, evidence, or access to legal counsel to deport workers with valid visas raises grave human rights concerns. Targeting Filipino crew members under the guise of combating child pornography, while denying them basic legal protections, smacks of systemic abuse and racial profiling. The lack of transparency and accountability from CBP must be investigated immediately. No one should be stripped of their rights based on secret accusations.</p>\n",
