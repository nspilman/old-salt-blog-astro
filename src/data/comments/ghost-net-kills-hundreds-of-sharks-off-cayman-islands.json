Thanks for reprising the role that SV KWAI played last summer in removing over 40 tons of plastic and disposing of it ashore in Oahu (burned, I believe, to create energy).   What we are doing to our oceans is reprehensible and irresponsible.   There are horrible long term consequences.  Today in the NY Times, there is a front page article about cold stunned sea turtles which get caught in Massachusetts Bay and wash up on the north shore of Cape Cod.   Some are found during regular beach patrols by volunteers and rehabbed on the Cape and in Boston, then those which survive are flown to Florida.   The article mentioned that several had been rescued before, in 2017 and 2018&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>\n",
