    "content": "<p>I was there that morning as part of the USCG response aboard the Staten Island Ferries.  Always a tough day.  The other day I retold the story to my son now 18, (one year old at the time of the attacks) for a college project he is working on.  The combined efforts of the maritime community, and my own ride back to Ft Wadsworth via one of the water responders caused me to break down for the first time in a long time.  The memories are still very fresh, I suppose in a way they always will be.  Thanks for the article.</p>\n",
