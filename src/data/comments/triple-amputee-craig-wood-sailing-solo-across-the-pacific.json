    "content": "<p>How poignant.  I am going to the funeral today of Andy Cassell, a man born without legs that became a Gold Medal Paralympian in the first sailing event in the 1996 Los Angelos Paralympics after he fought for the sport&#8217;s inclusion. In previous years he had been sailing full bodied Olympic dinghies but his backer ran ouf of money. In the same year he founded the Andy Cassell Foundation which purchased a fleet of Sonar keelboats which have been used to introduce thousands of disabled people to sailing. The Foundation is still active 29 years later.</p>\n<p>I sailed thousands of miles with Andy including a Fastnet Race in 1983 but that paled into insignificance when you realise he had sailed a J30 in the fatal 1979 Fastnet storm to a safe port in Eire.</p>\n<p>I am certain he would have known and inspired Craig, two remarkable people.</p>\n",
