Lancasters carrying tallboys and four carrying 12 x 1,000lbs bombs escorted by mustangs from two other squadrons (442 &amp; 611(RCAF)) for fighter defence. The Sqn ORB reads:<br />\n16.04.45 Eighteen aircraft operated against a shipping target at Swinemunde. Most aircraft were holed by flak. S/L. Powell failed to return. Aircraft was seen to receive a direct hit and went down out of control. One parachute seen to stream at about 2,000 ft. (Fauquier felt sure that after the last two abortive raids and the long run in involved that fighters would be ready for them this time. He asked for and obtained a long range fighter escort. There were no fighters but ferocious flak which holed most of the aircraft and downed Powell. Prinz Eugen was not present but there were some close misses on the Lutzow although the results were not clear at the time of the raid. Powell’s port wing was hit and fell off, the aircraft spinning into a wood near the target, killing all the crew. The bodies were buried on the 18th April in the Caseburg Friedhof at Swinemunde but were exhumed in 1949 and reburied at Poznan Old Garrison cemetery.)</p>\n<p>In memory of John Leonard Powell DFC</p>\n<p>Squadron leader 103039 pilot 617 Sqdn., Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve<br />\nDied: Monday, 16th April 1945.<br />\nAge: 29.<br />\nAdditional information: son of David Albert and Elizabeth Powell, of Rhos, Glamorgan.<br />\nCommemorative information: Poznan old garrison cemetery, Poland<br />\nGrave reference/ panel number: coll.
