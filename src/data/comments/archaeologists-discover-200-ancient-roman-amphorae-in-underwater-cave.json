So the presumption of being an offering for an appeasement seems reasonable.  The part where some of the jugs remained intact says water may have been present.

The cave was obviously dry then ( lower sea and water tables perhaps,) or there wouldn&#8217;t have been any &#8216;tites and mites&#8217;.<br />\nSailors nicking the cargo? It has been known. In medieval times sailors would drill holes in the wine casks -tuns- suck out the wine and fill the hole with clay. Even the great Nelson was said to have had the rum he was preserved in after Trafalgar sucked out this way. A foolish rumour no doubt.<br />\nMaybe the Roman/Greek/ sailors were just doing as sailors always have. Lightening the ship, perhaps.</p>\n",
