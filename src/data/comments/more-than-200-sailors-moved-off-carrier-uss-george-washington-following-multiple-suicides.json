I feel that each grouping or cluster has its own reason.<br />\nPerhaps they should be looking deeper to get to the real reason for these suicides. I would think that if you were to blame the suicides on the overhaul or rebuild that the suicides would be spaced further apart not clumped together.<br />\nPerhaps the navy, by allowing the officers to take residence off the ship, would distract from the real reason and hopefully make the reporters go away.</p>\n",
