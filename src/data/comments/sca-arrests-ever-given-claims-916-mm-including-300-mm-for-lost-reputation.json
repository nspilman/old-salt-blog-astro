    "content": "<p>With regard to the above comments unless the boiler is in a ship it is free from arrest !!  As to the lawyers getting new toys with their fees that could help with the economy !!</p>\n<p>Ship arrest is a process by which a ship is prevented from trading or moving until the maritime matter in question is resolved.  It is granted by an Admiralty Court to secure the maritime claim and is unique to Admiralty Law.</p>\n<p>My personal thoughts are that the SCA pilots made a misjudgment in advising the ship&#8217;s Bridge Team on the handling of the ship and the SCA is in &#8220;protection mode&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Good Watch.</p>\n",
