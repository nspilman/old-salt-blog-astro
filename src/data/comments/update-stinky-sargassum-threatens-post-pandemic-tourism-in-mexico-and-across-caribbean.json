    "content": "<p>In times past, when folk had to work with the natural world to grow food , they used to collect seaweed and spread it on their fields. This rendered habitable many places with impoverished soil and few resources, to support whole villages.<br />\nNow, in a time when energy costs are spiralling , input to farms is threatening bankruptcy to many, and food shortages to millions, does this huge mass of rich material present a gift, or only a dramatic nuisance? Might there be some economical way to harvest, dry, compress the stuff and put it to good use? Millions of tons of cheap fertiliser or only a downer for holidaymakers?</p>\n",
