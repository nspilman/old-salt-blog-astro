    "content": "<p>Time was also &#8220;sold.&#8221; In Edinburgh, the ball was raised on Calton Hill slowly to give prewarning and dropped as a syncronised gun was fired from Edinburgh Castle, the famous &#8220;One O&#8217;clock Gun&#8221; still fired today except on Christmas day, Good Friday and Sundays. Initially this was done visually but was electrically connected later on. The advantage of this was clocks could be syncronised in poor visibility. Circles superimposed over a map of Edinburgh gave the time for the sound of the gun to travel which could be used for both the ships in dock and for businesses to set time for work clocks etc.</p>\n",
