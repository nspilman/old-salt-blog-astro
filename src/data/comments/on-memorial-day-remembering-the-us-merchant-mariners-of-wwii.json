After all there were numerous stragglers whom were not able to keep up.  As well as other situations where ships thought they could sail with out protection and are now littered across the sea floor.  Most of them near the coastline because the US was too foolish to turn off its lights at night.  Our ignorance proves how numb we can be through out history.</p>\n",
