    "content": "<p>As both an enlisted Marine and then a Naval Reserve Officer, we always trained with the maxim &#8220;The more you sweat in peacetime, the less you bleed in war.&#8221;  Unfortunately, sometimes we bleed in peacetime.  We need to minimize that and learn from tragic events such as this.</p>\n<p>The picture shows the hatches open outward.  It would be very hard, if not impossible, to blow these.  I wonder if having one escape hatch that opens inward might be a better idea.  Once the AAV was flooded, it would be easier to escape.  Remembering Navy damage control training in flooded compartment simulators as a result of lessoned learned from Pearl Harbor.</p>\n<p>Semper Fi Marines!  I hope lessons are learned and your sacrifice is not in vain.</p>\n",
