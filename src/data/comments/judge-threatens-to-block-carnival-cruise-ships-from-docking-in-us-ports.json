Presumably the gun would handle multiple copies. Raking, rippling delivery of 200-300 Bowditch would surely capture attention. </p>\n<p>But come to think of it, maybe something earlier and more primitive w/smooth bore would be better. Rifling might produce only confetti, a Carnival atmosphere.</p>\n",
