    "content": "<p>“Investigators accuse DK Marine’s owner, Sun Yol Kim, of paying for ‘room salons,’ where the services of prostitutes could be hired, for Monroy at least 10 times…”</p>\n<p>The attitude towards the sex industry in Korea is different than in the US, for sure. Room salons, coffee girls, massage parlors &#8211; this stuff is EVERYWHERE, not segregated in a red-light district (although there are those, too). Underage prostitution is terribly common, too &#8211; girls in elite high schools picking up a little spending money, I was told. Many Korean wives (whom I taught English to) take it for granted that their husbands will, hmm, indulge. </p>\n<p>You can imagine how this atmosphere acts on ordinary straight men from America and elsewhere, right? I mean, the stories I heard, jeepers. As a gay man who wanted to keep my job &#8211; homophobia is pretty rife in Korea &#8211; I kept my distance from the sexual underworld, but I will admit, I would listen to my colleagues if they wanted to talk. 😏</p>\n",
