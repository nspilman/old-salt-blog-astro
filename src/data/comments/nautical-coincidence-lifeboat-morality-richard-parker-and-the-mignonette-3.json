Most sources deny this part of the tale, which is a shame. There apparently was a Clement but he was the son of Henry&#8217;s uncle, also named Henry, in England. It seems likely that Henry, in America, died childless.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Speaking of cabin boys, there was a Henry Spelman who indentured himself in order to get out from under his father, an English sheriff. He and another boy were basically sold to the Powhattan in exchange for grain during the starvation. John Smith at one point suggested Henry was saved by Pocahontas before taking credit himself. Spelman wrote a book, but never mentioned her. He was, I believe, the first man tried for treason in the new colony, for &#8220;speaking ill of the governor before the Indians.&#8221; You and/or I may be related to him, though obviously its a big stretch.. He did marry a native woman. Some people want to be descended from kings; I want to be descended from Henry Spelman.</p>\n",
