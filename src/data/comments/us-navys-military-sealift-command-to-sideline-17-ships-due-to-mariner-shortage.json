    "content": "<p>Laying up all these ships is not going to do much as the EPF’S only have a crew of 22 to 26 people fully manned and most of them will not go back to the big fleet as they think they will. Why they are so short on people is because MSC has forgotten about the mariner And treats them like they are nothing anymore they could care less about the mariners how have been with them for years and let the new mariners do what they want to forcing the old mariners to quit or retire early and they don’t care even though accident have skyrocketed because the newcomers have no idea what they are doing and expect the old timers to teach them without getting anything for it. They really need to look at themselves instead of us mariners.</p>\n",
