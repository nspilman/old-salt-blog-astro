    "content": "<p>An interesting story, was there much loss of life in the explosion?<br />\nWe had two WW1 exploding munitions incidents on the River Medway in Kent, England without any enemy interference. There was the battleship HMS Bulwark which was destroyed and sunk and is now a war grave site marked with named buoys, the other was a passenger ship converted to munitions carrier called HMS Irene which for reasons unknown is not a war grave and is just marked with an isolated danger buoy in the middle of the channel near the Thamesport container terminal. Over 800 officers and crew died in the HMS Bulwark and 377 people were killed in the Irene incident.</p>\n",
