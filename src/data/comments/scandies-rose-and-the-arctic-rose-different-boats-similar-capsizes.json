    "content": "<p>Icing on the Scandies Rose is my guess as well.</p>\n<p>I spent many years dealing with stability on cargo ships. Fishing vessels are another world entirely. Cargo ships, be they container ships, breakbulkers or tankers, load cargo in a safe port and batten down for sea. Fishing vessels leave without cargo and then load their cargo at sea, which from a stability point of view is nuts.</p>\n<p>The USCG approved Stability Booklet on the Arctic Rose was so restrictive as to be totally useless, so it was completely ignored.  </p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Icing, I&#8217;m thinking. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m acquainted with a marine architect here in Seattle, not so long ago retired. One of the reasons he finally burnt out was wrangling with fishing vessel owners over stability booklets. Obviously for fishermen there are sound reasons (leaving aside safety) to pile on more top hamper in various forms. A bigger crane, a few dozen more pots&#8211; all these things help make sometimes marginal economic situations more tenable. D. found himself constantly pushed to make error bars wider in the &#8220;right&#8221; direction, arguing with his clients over cross-purposes, eventually tired of it entirely.</p>\n",
