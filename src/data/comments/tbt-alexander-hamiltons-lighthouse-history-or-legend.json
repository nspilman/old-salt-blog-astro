It was timely for me, after listening to a song by a friend (link below) that references &#8220;Hamilton&#8217;s Light&#8221; in telling a story where the schooner Patriot was lost off Cape Hatteras on January 1, 1813. I did not know that the original Light there has been called Hamilton&#8217;s Light.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reverbnation.com/play_now/31095325?utm_campaign=a_public_songs&#038;utm_medium=unknown&#038;utm_source=page_object_news_item\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.reverbnation.com/play_now/31095325?utm_campaign=a_public_songs&#038;utm_medium=unknown&#038;utm_source=page_object_news_item</a></p>\n",
