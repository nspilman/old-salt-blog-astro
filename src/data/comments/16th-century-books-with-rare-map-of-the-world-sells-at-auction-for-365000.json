    "content": "<p>All the revered explorers used Chinese charts to take them to their &#8220;newly discovered&#8221; destination. Columbus, Magellan et al. It would have been like Elon Musk landing on Mars only to find a McDonalds with a working ice cream machine.</p>\n<p>A fantastic read (and great hint to the family for your Christmas present,) is &#8220;1421: The Year China Discovered The World&#8221; by Gavin Menzies. Its subject is the great expedition by the eunuch admirals, (I kid you not,) in ships, giants of their time, their rudders were ten metres high, that split into two fleets being pushed by the trade winds circumnavigating the globe. (Spoiler alert for the flat earth society.) A recently blown down tree in Australia had some of their pottery discovered that had been buried in the roots. It is a historical and factual read with a story better than fiction and a real twist at the end.</p>\n",
