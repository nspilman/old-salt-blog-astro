And yes, the generators can also drive the electric motors to turn the propellers. </p>\n<p>I sailed on the Star Flyer, the four-masted barquentine, many years ago and she sailed beautifully. Her square sails are set and furled by hydraulic motors in the yards like the Royal Clipper and the Flying Clipper.</p>\n",
