    "content": "<p>The first use of natural gas as a fuel was in LNG carriers with steam plants where they burned the natural gas that boiled-off in transit in the ships&#8217; boiler. 100% efficient with no loss of methane.

Things get problematic with lower pressure medium speed diesels on cruise ships.</p>\n",
