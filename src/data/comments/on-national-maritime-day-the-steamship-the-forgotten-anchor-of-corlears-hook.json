    "content": "<p>There is a interesting book in Rhode Island School of Design.   Written by one Admiral Nelson.  It was a review of designs that had been compiled for the queen.  Alot of the designs were of the wiggle cylinder design used by modelers today.  Their designs were so primitive that I wouldnt be surprised if the cylinders fell off the engine during the trip and were probably scrap at the end of her voyage.</p>\n<p>Yet we dont know what design she used.  Granted paddle boats in the later years used walking beam engines.  They are truly a sight to see if ever one can.</p>\n",
