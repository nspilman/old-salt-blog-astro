    "content": "<p>I sailed on her in the 90&#8217;s when the non-profit was trying to raise money to re-outfit her.  One of the passengers was a former skipper who told me that the Bounty had tremendous leaks even in calm weather.  He did not think it was a good candidate for refitting.  Later she was sold to I believe a plumbing contractor on Long Island who promised to refit her and sail her.  I remember he wound up spending a lot more than he had planned for but lost touch after that.  RIP to the two who passed away.</p>\n",
