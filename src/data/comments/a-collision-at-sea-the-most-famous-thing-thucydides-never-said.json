    "content": "<p>I had heard that quote, and may have used it myself a few times.  So I got a copy of Thucydides Peloponnesian War and read the whole thing, looking for the quote.  I was disappointed that I couldn&#8217;t find it.  I felt that I had missed something, that I wasn&#8217;t looking in the right place or who knows what.  I did scale back my use of the quote because I couldn&#8217;t prove it.  Couldn&#8217;t drag out the book and give you chapter and verse (as it were).<br />\n &#8220;The Peloponnesian War&#8221; has much to recommend it.  l might take another look.<br />\n So thanks.  I feel much better now.<br />\nRegards,   Fox sends. </p>\n<p> Bruce Fox, CAPT USNR-RET</p>\n",
