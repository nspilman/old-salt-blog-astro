    "content": "<p>This is not about politics, this is about just making New York and New Jersey just a little more habitable.   Visiting the Hudson River is as much of an oasis as visiting Central Park or Prospect Park.  Every other inch of New York is plastered with advertising.   There are but a few places where one can stay in the City, to escape the City, to achieve some peace and serenity; the Hudson River is one of them.   Ban this visual cacophony.   And advertisers on this burdensome, bellicose, boorish barge, beware the power of the purse.</p>\n",
