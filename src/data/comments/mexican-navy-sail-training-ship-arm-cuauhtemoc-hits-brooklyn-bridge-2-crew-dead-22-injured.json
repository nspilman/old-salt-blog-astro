We always housed the main t&#8217;gallant mast, even when a low tide might have permitted unhoused passage. As I liked to say, it&#8217;s better to be paranoid than dismasted. I offer no opinion in the Cuauhtémoc matter. But I dread the the likely constant replay of the video(s), just as I dread the Cisne Branco/bridge videos.</p>\n",
