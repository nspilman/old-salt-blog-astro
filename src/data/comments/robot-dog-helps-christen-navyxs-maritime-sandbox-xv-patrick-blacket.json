    "content": "<p>J-P:<br />\nThe XV is intended to have a distinctive appearance, she is not painted pussers grey, but matt back, carrying a large NavyX logo, and the pennant number X01 highlighted in gloss. She will not be a commissioned vessel but will serve under the Blue Ensign, being an unarmed, government-owned vessel simplifies her operation and the way she could be employed.</p>\n<p>A large QR code will be painted on each side of the superstructure to give smartphone users a link to a website of NavyX’s choice. An excellent way to promote public engagement and provide a timely explanation of the work being undertaken. She will attend both RN and NATO exercises around the UK and abroad and is a flexible platform that will provide a broad range of experimentation options for NavyX and wider industry.</p>\n",
