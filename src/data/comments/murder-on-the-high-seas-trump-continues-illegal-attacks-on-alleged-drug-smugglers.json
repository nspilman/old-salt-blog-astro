    "content": "<p>The Trump regime has provided zero evidence that the mariners killed by the US attacks are drug smugglers. And, if they are smugglers there is also no legal justification for killing them except in cases of self defense. The US Coast Guard has a long and successful history of interdicting and arresting drug smugglers without using lethal force. Trump is choosing to murder sailors in international waters solely to distract his idiot followers from his criminal pedophilia documented in the Epstein files.</p>\n",
