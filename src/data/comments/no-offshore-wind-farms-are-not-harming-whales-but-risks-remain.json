    "content": "<p>The scientists blithely ignore the impact of a large amount of poisons encapsulated and sunk around the world in casements designed to last 50 years.  That 50 years is long passed.  One ship was sunk about 100 miles southwest of San Francisco &#8211; where not too long ago whales in distress were spotted.   Those pushing environmental causes ignore what it takes to create and maintain these giant devices in corrosive conditions.   They also ignore biochem war impact vis a vis these ships that were sunk.  It is good to assemble ALL the facts before crusading.</p>\n",
