    "content": "<p>I must say that the history of canoe journeys stretches back many centuries. The Haida in particular voyaged at least as far as Baja California and to characterize them as &#8220;raiding the Puget Sound villages for slaves&#8221; does them a great disservice on so many levels. So for a small hint of their history read Ravens Cry by Christie Harris. As a Haida, as a crew member of the Lady Washington, as an educator I am committed to tell history in all of it&#8217;s complexity.<br />\n    Now on to Mr. Jewitt&#8230; he had a tendency, after the first printing of his story was printed and sold out, to embellish his story to increase sales and to target his audience. He was taken by the Nu Chul Nuth.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Part of the history of these canoe journeys is the Haida from the BC coastline coming down and raiding the Puget Sound villages for slaves.<br />\nThere is a book, &#8220;The Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt&#8221;  which is the memoirs of a sailor who was taken captive in 1803 by a BC coastal Tribe, the Nootkas.<br />\nInteresting reading, although there is speculation that not all is factual.</p>\n",
