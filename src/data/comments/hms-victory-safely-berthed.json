    "content": "<p>Hogging and sagging refers to the effect of an unequal distribution of weight pressing down and buoyancy pushing upward on a ship or boat. Hogging is when there is more weight in the ends causing the bow and stern to droop. Sagging is more weight in the middle causing the bow and stern to go up and the middle of the ship to bend down. Wooden ships have a tendency to hog over time.</p>\n",

That&#8217;s the term they used and how they explained it. I had not heard of the term before then.</p>\n",
