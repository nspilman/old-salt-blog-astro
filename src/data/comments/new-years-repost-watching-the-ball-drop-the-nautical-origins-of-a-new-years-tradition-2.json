It was electronically connected to the ball on nearby Carlton Hill that is visible from Leith Docks. When visibility was poor and the drop could not be seen, charts with circles whose diameter were related to the speed of sound in seconds were used to calibrate the chronometer.<br />\nThe system was also used by hawkers to sell the accurate time to businesses for setting their timepieces that would, for instance, stamp the time for workers clocking on and off.</p>\n<p>A Happy New Year to you all!</p>\n",
