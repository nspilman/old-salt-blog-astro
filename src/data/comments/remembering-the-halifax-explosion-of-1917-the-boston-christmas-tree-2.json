    "content": "<p>When I visited the Bedford Road cemetry in 1981 after joining the Norwegian sailing ship Sorlandet I saw the graves of Titanic victims and the mass graves for those killed in the Halifax explosion, not knowing then what it was about when hitching a lift back to town I asked and the lift took me to a hill above Halifax where I was shown a large lump of metal anchor surrounded by iron railings, I was told it came from one of the ships and that was where it landed and had to stay. Some years later I met the ex submariner and folk singer Tom Lewis and he told me that when housebuilding was going in the area the lump of anchor some 3/4 mile from the harbour was moved and resited but had to be put back as that was where it landed and where it had to stay.</p>\n",
