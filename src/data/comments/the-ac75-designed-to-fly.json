Well, capsizing is also different.</p>\n<p>Looks like about 6kts minimum wind speed to race without much debate. Upper limits seems to create some debate.</p>\n<p>I like the new technology and speed but I also love the mono-hull chess-like competition.</p>\n<p>F1 vs. grand prix racing.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to America&#8217;s Cup.</p>\n",
