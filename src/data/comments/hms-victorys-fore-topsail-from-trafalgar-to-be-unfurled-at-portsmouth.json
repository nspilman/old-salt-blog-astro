    "content": "<p>This tops&#8217;l was displayed in a sail loft at Portsmouth during the 2005 Trafalgar bicentennial celebrations. Only a roped perimeter separated it from visitors. It was a privilege to see it. When his health did not permit him to travel, I stood in for the late-Patrick Tull who had organized a small group to attend assorted Nelson 2005 activities. Seeing Victory and the tops&#8217;l was one event. Others included a Prince Andrew-hosted dinner in Greenwich&#8217;s magnificent Painted Hall, a visit to Lloyd&#8217;s of London&#8217;s impressive Nelson collection, a Prince Philip-hosted dinner at the London Guildhall, and then, serendipitously, I walked into a gallery on the Mall to find Geoff Hunt setting up a Royal Society of Marine Artists show. Great celebration&#8230;</p>\n",
