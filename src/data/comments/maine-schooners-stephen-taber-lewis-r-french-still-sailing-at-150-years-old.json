    "content": "<p>Having sailed for decades , I wanted to experience big historic schooner sailing. The French did not disappoint ! Nothing like it anywhere, Garth Wells is living the dream!  The perfect host, and knowledgeable master, you can learn so much from him.,I spent a lot of time at the wheel, I will never forget that! Thank you Garth , for making that possible. If you like sailing, and history, eating, and a simple way of life, step back in time and go for a trip , A lot of passengers are repeaters, that says a lot. Hello to Garth, can’t believe 18 yrs!!!</p>\n",
