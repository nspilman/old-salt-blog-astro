    "content": "<p>I was flabbergasted to read this post and the report. My first trip to sea in January 1954 found me steering the ship in these very waters.  I was just 17 at the time looked about 14/15 and the Pilot, quite rightfully, questioned my being the on the wheel.  However our Master told him that I was an experienced helmsman from fishing boats on the South Coast of Ireland. </p>\n<p>To read of the behaviour of this Pilot in a vessel ten times the size of ours in 1954 is beyond believe.  Fortunately this must be an exceptionally unusual person and case.  In the 50 years I spent on the Bridge from that child helmsman to Master the Pilots by and large were competent.</p>\n<p>I hope the Chief Pilot has had a Pilots meeting reviewing professional protocols and banning personal cell phone use. Certainly a line handlers problem on a previous occasion should not have resulted in this multi-million event.</p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",
