    "content": "<p>Looking at the hull below the waterline.  It looks as if whom ever that was fabricating was skimping on some of the fabrication.  The hull skin only had adhesion around the box like areas.  Where boats that are built by the loocals on Mount Desert Island (hinkley&#8217;s and others) the box area would have been filled and nnot missing in the centers.  Some of those box areas you can see where it looks as if it were poured in.  The construction up here would have been a sprayed in construction, never poured.  </p>\n<p>I wish the owner the best of luck getting money back.  Alas Ii too have lost money internationally when the company folded from shoddy workmanship.  Only to see that the corporate directors all got fat paychecks and restarted the company elsewhere.  Since it was a new company they had no obligatioon to what they destroyed or past debts that were due.</p>\n",
