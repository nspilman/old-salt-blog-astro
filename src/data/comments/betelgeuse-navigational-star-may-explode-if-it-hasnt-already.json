According to Phil Plait aka Bad Astronomer it&#8217;s exciting because science now has a lot of equipment to measure what is going on. (Scientists are put out by the article because it is so poorly written) It has been dimmer. If you want to panic people use the fact that the North Star Polaris is moving. And in around 2 million years it won&#8217;t be north anymore.</p>\n",
