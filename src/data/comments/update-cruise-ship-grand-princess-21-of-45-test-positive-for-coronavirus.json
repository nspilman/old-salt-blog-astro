Good people are working very hard to resolve a completely new and rather scary virus sweeping the World.  If you have a solution I am sure they would be delighted to hear it. In the meantime move above the pettiness, drop the damn politics and try to wok together helping and caring for each other.<br />\nThere was a meeting this afternoon in Port Everglades, FL by the VP and the State of Florida Administration with the CLIA.<br />\nThe ships crews will have &#8220;enhanced&#8221; checks as will the arriving and  departing passengers.  All this will be helpful no doubt but again the petri dish atmosphere is not resolved by continuing the cruises themselves which are going to places which are unwilling to allow them port entry and landing permission.</p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",
