Hundreds of firefighters on the ground and multiple aerial-firefighting aircraft from both Iran’s IRGC Aerospace Force and Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations assisted with the blaze, while a number of secondary explosions yesterday hampered operations, further spreading the fire to other sections of the port. The death toll from the explosion and result fire currently sits at 65, though it is expected to significantly rise, while over 1,200 people were reported to have been injured.</p>\n<p>Drone footage from the port of Bandar Abbas in Southern Iran, showing a massive crater as well as immense damage to the port following Saturday’s chemical explosion and resulting fire, which was finally brought under control and extinguished early Monday.<br />\n<a href=\"https://x.com/i/status/1916944843680424163\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://x.com/i/status/1916944843680424163</a></p>\n",
