    "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve had a look at the Zong case, Gregson v. Gilbert, 99 English Reporter 629, and come to the conclusion that it is a case of particular, not general, average, in which insureds sued their underwriters for refusal to pay a claim. There was no joint venture of cargo and carrier to implicate the law of general average. Gregson (and his partners) owned both the Zong and her human cargo. Moreover, the jury verdict for the Zong&#8217;s owners was overturned on motion by the underwriters, and a new trial ordered. See, e.g., Marouf Hasian Jr., Domesticated Abolitionism, the &#8221;Human Cargo&#8221; of the Zong, and the British Legal Usage of Dehumanizing Rhetoric, 1783-1807, 76 Western J. of Communication 503 (2012); James Oldham, (2007) Insurance Litigation Involving the Zong and Other British Slave Ships, 1780-1807, 28 J. of Legal History 299 (2007). There seems to be no evidence that a second trial ever took place. As far as can be ascertained then, the underwriters never paid.</p>\n",
