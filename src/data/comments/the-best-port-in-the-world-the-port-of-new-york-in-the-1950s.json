    "content": "<p>Wow Rick that video brought back many memories.  I first arrived in Port of New York at the end of January 1954 as a 17 year old Deck Apprentice in one of those ships.  We docked at Hoboken and I think more Italian was spoken on the piers than English by the longshoremen.  The video says it all organized chaos and not a hard hat or safety vest amongst the lot !!</p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",
