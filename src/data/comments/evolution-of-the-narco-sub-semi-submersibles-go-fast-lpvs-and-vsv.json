    "content": "<p>In the early nineteenth century “guinea boats” were used to smuggle gold from England to France. These were effectively high-speed rowing boats that could cross the Channel in an amazingly short time and were almost impossible to spot or catch by any single sailing craft. Though relatively expensive to produce, the boats were often abandoned after one trip purely for convenience. This is surely the twenty-first century’s equivalent.</p>\n",
