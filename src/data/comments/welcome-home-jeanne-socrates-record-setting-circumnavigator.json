This while Socrates was trying to get in, only a few miles further out. </p>\n<p>But looking at S/V Nereida&#8217;s specs  we see she carries 86 gallons of diesel in her tank plus &#8220;jerry cans in cockpit locker&#8221;  of which there cannot be many. And I suppose there&#8217;s an adequate supply still left after nearly a year and N nm. </p>\n<p>True, we had crew who &#8211;had&#8211; to be back in port by a certain date and so we had to do some motor sailing early and plain old stinky noisy grinding for the entire final day but wow&#8211; we could do better. 🙂</p>\n",

She limps close to Vancouver Island by day, but because of damaged sails she is pushed by the current,  back out to sea at night.
