    "content": "<p>Willy, before fossil fuels were operationalized the idea of traveling across the oceans without sails certainly fit the definition of a fantasy. Then we made it real.</p>\n<p>Ideally we&#8217;d be a little more forward-thinking because then (quite apart from climate change) we&#8217;d have employed fossil fuels as a really terrific stepping stone, given that there&#8217;s a limited supply of fossil fuel to use. Argue over a 200 year supply or a more optimistic 1,000 years of exploitable fossil fuels; whatever the case we&#8217;re going to need a replacement. But as a species we tend not to think more than a few years ahead, let alone more than a lifespan. </p>\n<p>What really we have here is failure of imagination,  I think.</p>\n<p>Also last time I checked vehicles powered by internal combustin engines (the Victorian-technology &#8220;farting thrashers&#8221;  still so popular today) cost money. They&#8217;re not actually free.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Get everyone to go electric vehicles for free.  Get companies to stop being greedy.  Get it so winters will keep people warm in the winters where some of us live in the cold with out burning fossil fuels.  Sound like a fantasy?  That is because it is.  Good luck on stopping global warming.  As it just wont happen.</p>\n",
