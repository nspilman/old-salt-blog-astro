    "content": "<p>When I visited the Bedford Road cemetery in 1981 when joining the Norwegian sailing ship `Sorlandet` I was given a lift back into town and mentioned that I had gone to see the 126 `Titanic` graves but found mass graves to the Halifax explosion what was it the lad said he would take me and show me something out of town, Up on a hill above the town was surrounded by iron railings a very large lump of anchor that had come from one of those ships involved a half mile or so from the basin. The follow up to this is that my friend tom Lewis the maritime singer  told me that they built houses up there and moved the piece of anchor only to be told that is where it landed put it back so today this memorial is rightfully where it landed.</p>\n",
