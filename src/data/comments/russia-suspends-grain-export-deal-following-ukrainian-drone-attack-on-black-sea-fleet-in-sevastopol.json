Three ships were hit including the newly designated flagship Makarov, a minesweeper and something else.  Russian ships will not want to be crowned flagship any more.  There is a video showing the explosive drone boat hitting the Makarov from onboard the boat.  For some reason the video stops at the moment of impact.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/sevastopol-unmanned-surface-vehicles-hit-051052181.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://news.yahoo.com/sevastopol-unmanned-surface-vehicles-hit-051052181.html</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Russia has simultaneously claimed launch from Odesa <i>and</i> from sea lanes established for transit of grain ships.</p>\n<p>Perhaps both are true? But here&#8217;s where Russia is instantly reminded of the costs of concertedly (and clumsily) lying. Not least, lies intended for internal consumption naturally leak into external ears, and those lies are so absurd as to be powerfully destructive on the country&#8217;s credibility elsewhere. It&#8217;s a true conundrum for the &#8220;government&#8221; of Russia; keeping the population onside means losing the overall information war. </p>\n<p>At this stage, what fool would believe <i>any</i> claim by Russia? The well of Russia&#8217;s credibility is bone dry.</p>\n",
