    "content": "<p>Congratulations to Sam Sikkema for keeping this marvelous piece of history alive. I clearly remember  looking at it in the early 50s and marveling at the idea that a 50 year old wooden ship was still plying the seas and was still so beautiful. Now ,68 years later, and still beautiful, this masterpiece of the days of old will continue sail the seas, keeping us in touch with the better years of long ago.<br />\nI wish great success to Sam and know that great success with this venture will be his.</p>\n",
