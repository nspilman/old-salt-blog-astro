    "content": "<p>LCS was a bad idea from the get go. A multi role anything is not good at any one of them, they haven&#8217;t enough crew aboard to perform any real mission, maintenance, or damage control if they did get hit. Basically, LCS is an empty shoe box<br />\nyou throw stuff in when you need to.  Fine. Except you&#8217;ve gotta have six months&#8217; notice of a crisis to get all the pieces up and ready, and delivered, set up and working on board. During my<br />\ndecades of service, both Navy and Army, we rarely got six days&#8217; notice of TSHTF somewhere. When things happen, they happen quick.  After the Navy<br />\nI became a Paratrooper. We were Light Infantry and lacked all the heavy stuff to stop tanks and<br />\nreduce field fortifications. We had our rifles and what we carried. That would be the exact situation LCS would find herself in. You fight with what you brought. Any tin pot with a third hand WWII destroyer could and would put paid to<br />\nany LCS caught out like that. The idea that TSHTF<br />\nand you go meet up with a Tender to be rearmed and restored and be on scene in time to make any difference is just dumb. McNamara dumb.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Many of the features of these ships were good ideas.  Making ships with versatility is a real plus in my book.  Alas trying to use drive systems for pleasure vessels I feel was a step too far.  The Cat Ferry has jet drive that is functional.  The only problem that the locals have seen with the cat ferry is the company cant come up with the monies to keep the boat operational.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the navy should stick to steel hulls that wont have the brittle nature of aluminum</p>\n",
