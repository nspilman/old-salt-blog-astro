    "content": "<p>It seems like the place to start would be &#8220;get these poor things out of salt water.&#8221; No museum ship is going to last long in salt water except by having extreme quantities of money flung at it. </p>\n<p>A few years ago congresspersons in Oregon wrestled congresspersons in Washington, and &#8220;won.&#8221; The upshot is that NOAA vessels previously moored in fresh water (Lake Union and Lake Washington) ended up to Newport, Oregon, where NOAA&#8217;s assets are more swiftly and efficiently corroded. Here the decision process is presumably a bit more streamlined and easier to manage.</p>\n",
