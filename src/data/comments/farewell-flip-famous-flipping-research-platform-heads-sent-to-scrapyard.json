    "content": "<p>Rick, what a too-quiet end to the distinguished career of of an amazing vessel. I remember seeing the news of her launch and what folks hoped to accomplish with her; it was one of those things that filled me with awe, hoping that this strange ship could help answer questions about our maritime environment. It&#8217;s worth a song, for sure &#8212; if you could, would you send me links I could use to craft a song around?</p>\n<p>I finally came back to the Shanty Session at the Noble Maritime Collection this afternoon after shoulder replacement surgery and months of rehab. It was great to be back in the Great Hall, with friends all around, and singing the old (and the newer) songs together. The legends didn&#8217;t simply die with wood planking and hemp &#8212; much can still be celebrated. Like I said, if you can feed me some links about FLIP, I&#8217;d love to try my hand at memorializing her.</p>\n",
