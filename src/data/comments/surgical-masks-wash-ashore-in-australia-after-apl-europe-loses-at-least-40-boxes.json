If you look at the photo in the post is shows three containers in a single block leaning over the side of the ship held by corner castings. The problem often starts when boarding water hits a bottom container on which other containers are stacked. Once the bottom box is crushed the boxes on top have to fall.</p>\n",

It is probably a logistical nightmare to redesign the ship to allow a running bond.  Also containers have to have some way for inspection.  If a running bond was used it would probably hamper the inspection of the containers.  </p>\n<p>Granted the containers that are falling off are the ones above the central hold of the ship.  Perhaps it would be better to extend the tracks that are used to align the containers.</p>\n",
