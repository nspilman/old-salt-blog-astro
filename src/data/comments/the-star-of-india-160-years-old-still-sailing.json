    "content": "<p>My wife and I were married on the Peking at South Street Seaport.  It was built in 1874 and was part of the Flying P line.  The Seaport sent it to Hamburg where it was rebuilt to be part of the Hamburg historical waterfront. There are very early film clips of it sailing around the Horn with loss of sailors during storms.  Fascinating historical ship and a real treat to be able to be married on the poop deck.</p>\n",
