    "content": "<p>One expects for those of us who have held commands of large vessels it was clear that CAPT. Crozier USN would not be reinstated.  To do so would have violated &#8220;the good order and discipline of the Navy&#8221;.  While his heart was clearly in the right place with his deep concern for his crew the method of seeking help and its resulting widespread publication was improper.<br />\nIn addition one surmises that his style of command and dressing like a fighter pilot popularity was important to him.  This may have been a factor which led to his summary and discourteous relieve.<br />\nMost navies reserve command at sea for their &#8220;seaman branch&#8221; not retrain fighter pilots to command their largest ships as the USN one believes does.  Perhaps this incident is an example of why they do so?<br />\nHopefully if CAPT. Crozier remains in the USN he will receive an appointment, while not a ship command, a position suitable to his talents.</p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",
