Still, innocent until proven guilty is a major standard.</p>\n<p>Here in Scotland we had a forest fire many years ago started by flares fired into the hillside. Local yachtsmen competing in a major regatta were declared guilty and an ugly situation arose. It turned out that local children had stolen flares from a temporary chandlery and caused the incident. The community and yachtsmen quickly made up which was itself heartening.</p>\n",
