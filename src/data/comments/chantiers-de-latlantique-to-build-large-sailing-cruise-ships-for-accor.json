    "content": "<p>I sailed on the Tovaritsch in 1992.  She is a 300 foot ship and she handled herself extremely well in the wide variety of sea conditions we experienced.  The five sisters were the culmination of tall ship engineering and were designed to be forgiving ships as the Eagle confirmed surviving the microburst off Bermuda a number of years ago.  I have been on dozen cruise ships since then including in very heavy weather.  The tall ship knifed through the water with its deep hull.  Cruise ships with sails as opposed to a sailing ship that cruises are two different entities.  Obviously I have no knowledge of what their engineers have come up with.  I have serious reservations as to how the ship will handle in heavy weather conditions after sailing on a traditional tall ship and understanding the fundamental difference between that and a cruise ship with sails.</p>\n",
