These ships are extremely expensive to rebuild and maintain.  That is the hard reality of life, and there is no end of other projects that also demand attention.  Thanks to all who tried to save her.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>After a long and fruitless fight to save the ship by a number of organisations in both America and Scotland this result can only be described as cultural vandalism. The dollars being paid to Shipwright LLC would have been better spent transporting this historic vessel to the Clyde in Scotland where she was wanted but where the money was never available to get her there.</p>\n<p>As I say Cultural vandalism the Bishop Museum trustees and Hawaii Harbour Board generally should bow their heads in shame for the way that they particularly have treated this old lady of the sea. I was lucky to be in Oahu and board and photograph her in 1997.</p>\n",
