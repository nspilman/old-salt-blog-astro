    "content": "<p>My son is currently in the society Islands after crossing in his Yacht NAIVASHA the North Atlantic, Caribbean and through Panama and beyond, while he has electronics he also has sextant and paper charts should the electrics fail. When We were in the square rigger SOREN LARSEN on the Cape Horn road in 1991 the last thing we thought of was relying on electronics for navigation. I did meet a Whitbread race yacht that when asked what happens if the electronic navigator fails replied oh we have several spares, sextant? &#8220;Oh there is one under a seat somewhere!!&#8221;<br />\nChris</p>\n",
