    "content": "<p>If they keep the oil warm enough it shouldnt cake up.  The problem with burning bio fuel is that the engine would need to stay running.  Otherwise the engine must switch back to diesel or the injectors will &#8220;cake up&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Caking is a matter of the injectors going cold.  Soot deposits form and render injetors inoperable.  Hence why bio fuel hasnt really taken off in America.  It is ok to use where its warm like Texas*.  Yet bio fuel has its limits in places like the north.  </p>\n<p>Note the reason Texas is refferred is that is where Willie Nelson has a fuel supplier selling bio fuel at the pumps.</p>\n",
