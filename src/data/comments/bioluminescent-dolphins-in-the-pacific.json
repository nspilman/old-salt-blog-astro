    "content": "<p>Loved it<br />\n We where on our extended trip in 1986 on the inter coastal water way  just entering Charleston Harbor. Donna, Lisa and Kenny sat at the bow with their feet over the rail, a dolphin swam next to the boat swimming on its side looking up at the kids. We traveled at 4/5kts for a half hour with the dolphin along side with the kids able to touch the animal with their feet.  We proceeded to the anchorage and looking back we saw the dolphin leaping out of the water putting on a show.  We called him/her Charlie Half Fin since he/she had a clipped dorsal fin.<br />\nwe all felt so connected to the dophen.</p>\n",
