    "content": "<p>I remember being in Montevideo in December 1991 after our historic rounding of Cape Horn when the British registered ships `Soren Larsen` and `Eye of the Wind` afterwards arrived in Montevideo I was then with the `Eye of the Wind` and was one day asked to give a local man a tour of the ship he afterwards asked me to go with him to his museum which was a large collection of items from the `Graf Spee` excellently preserved. If he is still around I would expect him to be one of those pushing for conservation of the eagle which I would whole heartedly agree with. It should also be remembered that the ships commander Lansdorf  also became a victim of the Nazi regime of the day he being of the old school of German mariners.</p>\n",
