    "content": "<p>The Curtis pusher is a very slow flying aircraft.  It has so much lift that it is possible to spin the aircraft around in flight and be able to fly it backwards with out crashing.</p>\n<p>A fact that is overlooked of early aviation.  The Wright Brothers may have taken to the air with their Wright Flyer.  They hoped to make money by holding a patent on wing warping as a means to control an airplane.  This gave birth to the Curtis Flyer that used flaps to control airplanes.  Thankfully he didnt demand everyone to pay him a fee for his design.  Where as the Wrights expected anyone using wing warping were to get a royalty.</p>\n",
