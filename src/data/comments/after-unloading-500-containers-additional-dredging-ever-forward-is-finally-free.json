Oh! but wait no doubt cabotage laws come into play the containers are now being transported between U.S. Ports.  By being removed from this non-U.S. registered vessel and landed in the U. S. an exemption will be necessary to reload them.<br />\nInteresting to see what happens.</p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",
