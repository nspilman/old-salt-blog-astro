    "content": "<p>Another excellent read would be &#8216;We fought them in Gunboats&#8217;, by Lt. Commander Robert Hitchens. RN. It was published posthumously in 1944 after Cmdr. Hichens had been killed during a night action. He was an amazing man, a dinghy and deep water sailor, a motor racing driver, a hill runner and much more. Heroism and deep modesty combined.<br />\nHis son, Anthony Hitchens , has written his biography, &#8216;Gunboat Command.&#8217; which is also a fine book. Wiki has an extensive entry on Robert Hitchens which is very well worth reading.<br />\nI am lucky to have an original copy of his book, bought by my father shortly after the ed of the 39-45 war &#8211; a very well worn and frequently borrowed volume .</p>\n",
