    "content": "<p>I had the good fortune to crew on the Schooner Pioneer with the South Street Seaport Museum, which also owned the Peking at the time.   My wife and I were married on the poop deck of the Peking in August &#8211; and our band played ska, reggae, and a lot of other great music.  Having been fortunate to sail on other tall ships, I can think of nothing more majestic than spending time on a ship that helped make history.  Thanks for sharing!</p>\n",
