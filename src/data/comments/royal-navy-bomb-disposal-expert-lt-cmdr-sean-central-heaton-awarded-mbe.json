    "content": "<p>What I also love about this article is the British sense of humour in nick names. &#8220;Central&#8221; Heaton! We had a joiner called &#8220;Lightning&#8221; because he could never hit the same place twice, a guy called &#8220;The Computer&#8221; because you had to punch information into him, a guy called &#8220;Boomerang&#8221; because he answered every question with &#8220;I&#8217;ll com back to you&#8221; and one called &#8220;ADK&#8221; who was famed for answering questions with &#8220;Ah don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The armed forces are also famous, we had Royal Navy pilots who were enrolled to the Top Gun Academy at Mirimar Base. They were in awe of the helmets  with names such as &#8220;Viper&#8221;, &#8220;Widow Maker&#8221;, &#8220;Assasin&#8221; and &#8220;Terminator&#8221; so they had to come up with their own names. One was &#8220;Dog Breath&#8221; and another was &#8220;Cholmondeley&#8221; which caused a lot of efforts by our American cousins to pronounce properly, I am not sure if it was ever revealed that it was pronounced &#8220;Chumly&#8221;</p>\n",
