    "content": "<p>Way back in 1998 when in the brigantine EYE OF THE WIND we sailed up from Pitcairn to Hiva Oa, we found the graves of Jacques Brel the French singer, Gaugin the Artist two graves apart dived in the pass and sailed round the corner past the inlet where Herman Melville deserted his whaler and then into the next bay where we anchored under a crown of rocks in the same anchorage as Robert Louis Stephenson`s schooner CASCO, pretty wonderful to have been where so many influential men of our time had been. When I was in SEA CLOUD in 1982 we had an Alumni group aboard who were doing a study on Moby Dick, Another connection is that of Captain Adrian Small who was boat steerer in Moby Dick the film made by John Houston, if you go to Youghal in Waterford Ireland today take a drink at the pub and talk the movie and look at the plastic white whale in the harbour with Ahab suitably tethered to it. Happy birthday Herman</p>\n",
