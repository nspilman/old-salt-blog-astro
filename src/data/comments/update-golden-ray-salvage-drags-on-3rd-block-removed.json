Theye were removed as that company wanted to remove the sections in smaller pieces.  There is some one else that has the hand on the trigger (so to speak) that had the first company removed from the site to be replaced by a different salvor company.  How long this group will last if they are not the ones that are actually making the decisions.  As Joe Blow (fictitious name) is the one with his finger on the trigger and may dislike this company as well.</p>\n",
