    "content": "<p>Why do scientists not believe the experienced seamen? We were ridiculed for suggesting that we had experienced the 100 foot wave, the statistical once in every one hundred year wave in the Northern North Sea. We had three in a week and one was 110 feet high, we knew that because of the scaffolding it removed from the Brent Charlie platform in November 1986. Many ships got hammered off South Africa, remember the Ben Cruachan?</p>\n<p>Then the QE2 was hit by one mid-Atlantic personally witnessed by Commodore Warwick and now there was an academic rush. Scientists were all over the phenomena like a rash. The Draupner wave put the cat amongst the pigeons and it was only 85 feet.</p>\n<p>We were also dismissed as idiots for daring to suggest we had seen an auk swimming 75 metres down on the sea floor from our Pisces submersible, compressed into a rugby ball shape, until we sent them the photos and film.</p>\n<p>But then again, what would we know?</p>\n",
