    "content": "<p>There is nothing like sailing on an historic tall ship in NY Harbor.  As soon as you leave the pier you are back in time.  A shout out to the schooner Pioneer crossing aft &#8211; built in 1885 and 102&#8242; overall.   I crewed on her and learned a great deal while having an amazing time.  Sailing out of the harbor under the Verrazano Bridge has everyone craning their necks to see if the masts will make it and then feeling the ocean breeze freshening up with any luck.  Thanks for sharing!</p>\n",
