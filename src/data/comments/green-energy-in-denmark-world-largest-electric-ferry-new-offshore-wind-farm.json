    "content": "<p>Whether Trump actually wants to buy Greenland or not is really a moot point.  What he has done by suggesting it is having a conversation as to why it would be in US best interests to have a stake in the game and pointing out that China and Russia are both becoming an issue in the area.  It is classic Trump to start a controversial dialog just to raise awareness of the situation and to draw attention to what he (and in this case others) believes should be an actionable item.  Denmark obviously doesn&#8217;t agree with the sale, but now they are under the gun not to sell mineral rights to China, who already has a shareholder stake in Greenland Minerals, Inc.</p>\n<p>Who knew it was an issue until Trump wanted to buy Greenland?</p>\n",
