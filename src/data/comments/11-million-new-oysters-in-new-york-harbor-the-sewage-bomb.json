We need to prevent any thing getting into ground water right from the get go.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of information in the news and anyone who can needs to support entities which are working on this sort of project.   We also need to prevent the bad stuff from reaching the oceans.  We cannot continue to use the water bodies of the  world as garbage dumps.   Ginny</p>\n",
