    "content": "<p>Madness.</p>\n<p>Last year they had the Fastnet before Cowes Week which took at least 30 competitors away from Cowes Week itself. That was £800 a boat of badly needed entry fees following the collapse of the low grade sponsor, Lendy.. What you have to remember is the majority of entrants are UK based and the extra 90 miles takes you even further from returning to the Solent which requires more time and either more leave or more expense in returning crew by ferry/flights and the boat by paid crew.</p>\n<p>I am afraid RORC are devoid of joined up thinking.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>This is an interesting change and is safer than sailing the English coast on the inshore routes.  It follows the routing as laid out in BA Chart 5500.  Refer to at the Western Approaches and La Manche charts to see that courses can be sailed to cross southwards after rounding the Fastnet to enter the La Manche/English Channel following the routing system.
