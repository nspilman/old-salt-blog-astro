    "content": "<p>Today (the day after the posting about the Great White Shark Cafe) a man came into Menemsha shop &#8212; since I have old Vineyard books he was looking for a book about JAWS, and he was visiting Menemsha to see where the film was made, etc.     He was born in Scotland, now lives in Switzerland and had just been diving with white sharks in the Rep of South Africa.    We had a very interesting talk and he spoke about the Cafe, and the place where the sharks congregate.  Then we spoke about Basking Sharks which was also fascinating.</p>\n",
