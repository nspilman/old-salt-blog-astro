    "content": "<p>Hermione is such a beautiful ship. Virtually new by most standards. How did she come to be rot filled so very soon after launching? Was the very long build time to blame &#8211; the empty hull allowed to get rain and stagnant water lying in it? Poor materials ? Unlikely in France where fine wood is so valued and grows in such profusion. What was the life span of a working ship in the period of the original Hermione? I suspect the builder would have been in serious trouble from the French Navy of the<br />\ntime had their handiwork mouldered away so quickly.</p>\n",
