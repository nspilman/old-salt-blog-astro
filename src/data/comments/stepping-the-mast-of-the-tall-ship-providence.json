    "content": "<p>We were discussing the origins of the expression stepping or unstepping a mast just this weekend. We could only find that the term is used because the mast rests on a step but no further explanation was given such as why use the word step. My boat has a keel stepped mast but I don&#8217;t think there is actually a step for it to rest on.<br />\nI will find out soon as it is overdue being unstepped for maintenance.</p>\n",
