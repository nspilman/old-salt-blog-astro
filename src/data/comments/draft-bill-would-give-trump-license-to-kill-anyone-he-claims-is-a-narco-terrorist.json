Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by communist aggression. The resolution served as Johnson&#8217;s legal justification for deploying US conventional forces to South Vietnam and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam in early 1965.&#8221;</p>\n",
