    "content": "<p>60 Minutes/CBS has George W  and Jon Meacham recounting the incident. There is a transcript with the video. It was HW Bush and fellow crew members Delaney and White in the plane. They all parachuted out of the plane alive. HW hit his head on the tail bailing out and after landing found his crew mates had not survived. but didn&#8217;t say or possibly know if they died from injuries on the plane before bailing, being shot, hitting the plane as he had or not survived landing in the ocean.  Sorry about taking so long to post. It took me a bit of looking to find where I heard about the account. HW may have given a more detailed account that exists on line or in a memoir/book. Jon Meacham is his Biographer. He didn&#8217;t want his 2 crew members to be forgotten.</p>\n",
