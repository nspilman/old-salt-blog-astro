You get gasoline and propane from cooking diesel.  So the next time you hear a supposed expert say on the news.  Diesel is more expensive than gasoline as there is more gas than diesel.  You too will know the expert is full of BS</p>\n",

That is after about 25 years of it being a brownfield site and the land being &#8216;decontaminated&#8217; before building commenced.<br />\nI did wonder about the oil reclaimed from wrecks in Scapa Flow, which was not nuked, was it pumped straight into the bunkers of the salvage vessel?</p>\n",

In 80F weather, if poured from a bucket (presuming it was pushed out of the bucket), would retain the shape of the bucket for a minute or so.  Bunker oil is great for boilers when they can atomize it to burn.</p>\n<p>In the Live Steam hobby fuel by heat were as follows.<br />\nWood (soft)= 3<br />\nWood (hard)=4<br />\npropane =5<br />\nkerosene = 7<br />\nMotor oil = 11<br />\nIt is only supposition yet it is my guess that bunker oil would be about 25.</p>\n<p>What do these numbers mean.  Well if you wanted to heat a boiler at 100 psi and you used bunker oil?  1 pound of bunker oil would be about 5 pounds of propane to do the same amount of heat.</p>\n<p>My apologies if these calculations are wrong.  I learneed it when  I was 18, alas now I am 60 and my memory is starting to blurr.</p>\n<p>Could it be reused?  I dont know.  Does oil have a radiation life?  In my elementary days there was something about aftter 7 years we would be able to grow crops again.</p>\n",
