    "content": "<p>We have the Queen Mary in Long Beach CA. I&#8217;ve stayed on her three times all on the port side, she&#8217;s tied up on the port side. The Spruce Goose used to be next to her or just up the channel a bit.<br />\nShe&#8217;s a nice boat a little rough around the edges but still fun and interesting. There&#8217;s a restaurant midship and a bar up in the forward cabin at the main deck line.<br />\nNot as fancy as the QEII but she has that funk appeal, the feeling of the 30s &amp; 40s. You can go visit the Battleship USS Iowa in Pedro when you stay on or visit the Queen Mary and soak in the history of LA &amp; Long Beach Harbor along with the San Pedro landing.</p>\n",
