They want to know why they are in Afghanistan and nine other countries killing people for no justification. Average Americans have not a clue as to exactly where we have stuck our fingers and why. The fact that the long arm of the military might be cut short through this virus might be the best thing that could happened to it. I do not wish harm to this servicepersons, I just want the US to stop harming the other 95 percent of the planet. There is a reason we have been identified as the biggest threat to world peace in a poll taken outside our snow globe about five years ago.</p>\n",
