    "content": "<p>Ramsgate in Kent, England has a tidal ball to indicate when there is enough water for vessels to enter the inner (locked) harbour. It is a sort of wicker affair on a mast near the Yacht Club.<br />\nI suspect that it is no longer hoisted or dropped because the harbour is run by the penny-pinching town council. I may be wrong.<br />\nThe nearest Time Ball was at Deal, just to the south.</p>\n",

It was connected by electronic cable to a cannon that fired simultaneously at Edinburgh Castle.
