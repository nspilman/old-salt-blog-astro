    "content": "<p>Coming across several boats overloaded and sinking in the Caribbean while transiting on the surface, we could have very well just marked the location and called the USCG for a rescue.  However, that is not what sailors do, while we had no room onboard and no desire to take a bunch of filthy lice ridden Haitians below decks, we could pull them up the side of the sub, give them water and hose them off, treat any medical issue we could, etc.; until the USCG showed up to transport.  I know the feeling those captains and pilots felt during the Manhattan evacuation.  It is what sailors do.  The USCG should be commended for helping, not hindering the evacuation.  And the real heroes are the survivors that patiently wait their turn.</p>\n",
