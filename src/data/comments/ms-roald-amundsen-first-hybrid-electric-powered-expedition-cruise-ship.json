    "content": "<p>It is not clear what the purpose of the batteries are (unless there is some unmentioned solar power).  Hybrid autos use the batteries to recover otherwise wasted power during braking and to give extra power during acceleration (which allows the use of a smaller, more efficient engine).  I don&#8217;t believe either braking or acceleration are major factors for a cruise ship.</p>\n",
