Yes, the boat is made from petroleum but there is far less carbon footprint in this mode of transportation (and she IS making a vital point) than in a jet plane!    Give her a break and frankly, I think that she should get some major credit, not to mention some major prizes.     Who among us would do a similar trip to make such a statement?  And yes, I have sailed across the Atlantic on a small sail boat, and I no longer fly.    I do take the train for long distances.</p>\n",
