However that stated the Officer involved was duly arrested, tried in Court and an adjudication made.<br />\nI would suggest that other Officers do not act in violation of Maritime Law better to resign and leave the vessel.<br />\nThere was also a report that some Port Pilots do not want to board Russian owned vessels in turn this is an issue that must be decided by the Governments of Countries in accordance with their National Laws.</p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",
