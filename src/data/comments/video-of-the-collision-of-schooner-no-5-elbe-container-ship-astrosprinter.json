The camera shows her responding about 20 degrees before they put the helm down all the way to complete the kamikaze turn across the freighters bow. Looks like they were making about 5-6 kts with plenty steerageway. From here it looks totally avoidable but the schooner capt was obsessed with trying to meet port to port. I think they hired the wrong guy to run that vessel.</p>\n",
