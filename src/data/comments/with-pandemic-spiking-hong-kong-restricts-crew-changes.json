No.) that these crews are unable or unwilling to further organize themselves so that they&#8217;re able to more cohesively face the very coherent, objective and poorly co-aligned ambitions of their employers.</p>\n<p>The fact of these crews in Hong Kong and elsewhere being chained to their ships is a diagnostic of latent, untapped power.</p>\n<p>Even from a perspective only of enlightened self-interest, we ought to do better by them.  Lots of lessons from history on this. </p>\n<p>*Unpolished numbers but easily within an order of magnitude.</p>\n",
