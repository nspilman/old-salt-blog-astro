I tried to get a response from the war graves people but received none so I suspect subterfuge.</p>\n",

These are peoples graves and should be respected.  To monitor the state of them from decay etc. rovs can be used and with no lives endangered.  Off the south coast of Ireland, I was born in Waterford, we have the RMS Luisitania again a grave site.</p>\n<p>Good Watch</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Thank you Peter for sharing your knowledge and experience. I called it an epirb as that is what I imagine would happen if some sort of released signalling device reached the surface. As there was no umbilical they should have some method of communicating distress in case they become trapped in a ghost net or suffered a loss of positioning power.<br />\nWe may never know what became of them but I sincerely hope that if they are not rescued that their demise was sudden rather than long and lingering.</p>\n",
