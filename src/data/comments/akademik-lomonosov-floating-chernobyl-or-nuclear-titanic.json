The United States Navy (USN) has lost two boats while five were lost in the Soviet Navy (one of which sank twice), and two from the Russian Navy. Only three were lost with all hands: the two from the United States Navy (129 and 99 lives lost) and one from the Russian Navy (118 lives lost), accounting for the three largest losses of life in a submarine. All sank as a result of accident except for K-27, which was scuttled in the Kara Sea when proper decommissioning was considered too expensive. The Soviet submarine K-129 carried nuclear ballistic missiles when it was lost with all hands, but as it was a diesel-electric submarine, it is not included in the list.<br />\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sunken_nuclear_submarines\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sunken_nuclear_submarines</a></p>\n",
