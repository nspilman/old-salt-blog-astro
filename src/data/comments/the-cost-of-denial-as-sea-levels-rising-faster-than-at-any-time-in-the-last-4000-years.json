    "content": "<p>There are so many levels to this issue.   The Outer Banks and other barrier islands are on sand that is constantly shifting.  A cursory examination of a current map versus an older one might surprise the viewer.  Putting structures up on shifting sand is a dumb idea made dumber by insurance companies willing to carry them and mitigating the cost among all insured.  We pay for misguided minds building the homes of their dreams on shifting sands.  What could go wrong does.  I lived on a barrier island and moved for several reasons &#8211; incessant flooding being one of them.  The Outer Banks also has some very rough weather and is the boneyard to a lot of wrecks because of it.</p>\n<p>Whatever else applies on the climate change issue is another chapter I am not able to intelligently address.</p>\n",
