    "content": "<p>No one has suggested that this was &#8220;Liebherrs first attempt at putting a crane on ship.&#8221; It is accurate to say that this is the largest shipboard crane ever built by Liebherr. Also, according to Liebherr, the hook block broke at less than half the test weight. The fact they purchased a critical component like the hook block and then failed to ensure that it met minimum specifications says nothing good about Liebherr quality control.</p>\n",

Actually 2 people do have serious but not life threatening injuries. They were in the crane cab. There were a number of injuries treated at the scene. The hook that should have held an overload of 5,500 tons snapped at around 2,600 tons. The ship still is listing and the damage on the quay is chilling. As is seeing the hook assembly slam the edge of the crane cab. Still, I find this big building stuff fascinating.</p>\n",
