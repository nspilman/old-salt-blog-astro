    "content": "<p>A Viking sailing vessel tour taking in visits to the distilleries in The Orkneys and the western Isles of Scotland certainly has appeal. Talisker on Skye might need careful planning as it is exposed to the West winds but I would certainly do Jura and all three distilleries on Islay. No need to do the full distillery tour after the first one (they are all pretty much the same), just go for the tasting.<br />\nWhilst visiting Talisker do take the opportunity to use &#8220;the facilities&#8221; just so you can experience the brown peaty water coming out of the washbasin taps, the source being directly from the hillside behind.</p>\n",
