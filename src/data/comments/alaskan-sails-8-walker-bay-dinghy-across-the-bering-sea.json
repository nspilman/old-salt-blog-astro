The boundary between &#8220;I can do this&#8221; and &#8220;Here Be Dragons&#8221; lies in each of us and can shift from day to day, hour to hour, minute to minute. We have to honor in some way the ones who are willing to push the envelope, or even break through it, even if they fail. They&#8217;re the ones out ahead &#8212; pathbreakers &#8212; who, in their own mad way, help keep our species alive, imagining, and growing.</p>\n",
