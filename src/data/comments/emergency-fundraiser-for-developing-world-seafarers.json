This is exactly what they have been doing for well over 150 years.   I have been a member and donor for about 40 years although I have never actually been in any of their facilities.    Good organization and Anglican so religious but they serve all and not just &#8220;Christians.&#8221;   They provide all sorts of support and assistance in 120 different ports around the world.    Please look them up but don&#8217;t get confused with folks who fly around in airplanes!</p>\n",
