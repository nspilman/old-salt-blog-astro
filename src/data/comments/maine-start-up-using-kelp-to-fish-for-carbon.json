Before the pandemic started, every week there was some one complaining about the kelp harvesters.  Yes kelp grows quickly.  The locals like to use what washes ashore for compost in their gardens.  Tho the kelp is a delicacy with the asian society.  Good for them that they want to eat it.  God knows the locals like the income.</p>\n",
