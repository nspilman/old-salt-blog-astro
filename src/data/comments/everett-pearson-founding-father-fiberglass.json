    "content": "<p>I was around fiberglass boats all my life here on the SoCal coast, of course, and I really did not examine or think about the development of the technology. When I got into my twenties I became a wooden boat aficionado and my friends and I referred to any fiberglass boat as Tupperware or plastic boats. Fiberglass over plywood was OK in our view but traditionally built wooden boats were best. I do feel that way now but it&#8217;s a matter of taste or preference.<br />\nThere are a lot of ugly fiberglass boats and lots of them around when I was a kid and there were some horrible plywood sailboats. I remember the Pearson&#8217;s in the marinas and I sailed on a few, they were nice boats, most or all full keeled, narrow of beam and had nice lines ~ and they sailed well. That&#8217;s more important than the wood/plastic debate.</p>\n",

I&#8217;ve gone to the &#8220;dark side&#8221; with a Catalina 36 (which I love).<br />\nRIP Mr. Pearson</p>\n",
