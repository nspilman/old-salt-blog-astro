Some are of the opinion that transmissions will in any case be terminated soon for security reasons.  Time will tell.  What costly mistakes.  But at least Norwegian reputation and pride has been somewhat recovered by such a professional recovery.<br />\nThe moral is &#8220;Keep a good lookout.&#8221; ?<br />\nAt 1808 the transmission is still live.</p>\n",
