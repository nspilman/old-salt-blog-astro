    "content": "<p>Thank you for a very good recounting of CPO Turpin&#8217;s service to our nation. </p>\n<p>It is a minor point, but the China Relief Campaign Medal mentioned above was awarded by the U.S. Army for service during the Boxer Rebellion.  It is unlikely Turpin received a U.S. Army medal while serving in the U.S. Navy. </p>\n<p>The similarly designated China Relief Expedition Medal was awarded to U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine personnel for service in the 1900-1901 China Relief Expedition during the Boxer Rebellion.  A service member was required to perform duty within the borders of China as part of the China Relief Expedition between May 24, 1900 and May 17, 1901 to be eligible. </p>\n<p>It is noteworthy mainly because U.S. Census records show Turpin as stateside in San Diego in 1900.  Some historians have claimed the Census record as evidence Turpin did not serve abroad during the Boxer Rebellion.  A U.S. Navy China Relief Expedition Medal award would tend to belie that conclusion.</p>\n",
