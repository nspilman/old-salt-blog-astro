    "content": "<p>Re whaling.  There is an old black and white movie titled &#8220;Down to The Sea Again in Ships&#8221;.  It covers 1 voyage of a whaling ship (actual film of one if not the Last voyage of an American sailing vessel from arounf 1920).  Drama aside, it gives an example of the trials and successes of a voyage and hunt from those open long boats.<br />\n In my opinion it is worthwile to sit and watch this film if you can find it. Onec in a blue moon it can be had on the Turner Classic Movie channel.</p>\n",
