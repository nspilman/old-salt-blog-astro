Congress needs to appropriate the funds for the Coast Guard to acquire more heavy icebreakers now!! The U.S. Coast Guard has been known to do more with less for a long time but it is imperative that this needs to change before the USCGC Polar Star and the USCGC  Healy break down and are unable to continue to serve. We need to protect our interests in both arctic regions before it&#8217;s too late!!</p>\n",
