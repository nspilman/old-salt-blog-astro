    "content": "<p>Kansas City news station explained that the passengers are not required to wear flotation jackets. the jackets are stored above the seats over the passengers heads. The area is a man made lake. When the vehicle rolled/capsized it sank around 40 feet, than slid down the side of the dammed area another 40 feet. The National Weather Service had the area in a severe weather advisory issued two days prior. Storms can be hit or miss but they had time to come off the water and didn&#8217;t until it was too late. The Driver died, the Captain is in the hospital. Haven&#8217;t been to the area but apparently there are several companies using &#8216;duck&#8217; boats. Usually we hear about party pontoons crashing into each other. This was families.</p>\n",
