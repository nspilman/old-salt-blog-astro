    "content": "<p>High Rick.  In a search for information on the U.S.S. Ford&#8217;s electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), I came across your very encouraging article explaining that EMALS was the least of Ford&#8217;s problems and it was all a Trump misunderstanding (actually, you called it &#8220;willful ignorance&#8221;).  That was great news because earlier articles I read indicated that &#8211; in contrast to more tractable problems that might be overcome in time &#8211; EMALS suffers from a fundamental and unanticipated problem; namely that there is no way to repair one catapult safely without shutting down all 4 systems.<br />\nBut then I saw this article &#8211; which seems to focus on the stupidity of people who use the wrong term for a supply ship.  That got we wondering if you are just a bone headed smarty pants and that the EMALS issues might be serious afterall.<br />\nCan you let us know which it is?  Thanks.</p>\n",
