    "content": "<p>Nonsense!  The type XXI U boat never used hydrogen peroxide as a fuel, this substance was simply too unstable and dangerous!  Yes, two did see a war patrol but I believe that more than 4 were completed before the war ended.  A number were sunk during their sea trials either by aircraft or mines while others were scuttled by their crews at the war&#8217;s end.<br />\n  The type XXI was the basis for the Russian Whisky class, the French Daphne class and also the Swedish Nordkaperen class subs.  The hull of the U.S. Navy&#8217;s first nuclear sub, the Nautilus was influenced by the class XXI.</p>\n",
