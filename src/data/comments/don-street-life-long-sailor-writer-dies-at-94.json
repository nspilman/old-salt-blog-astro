I consider D.M. Street, Jr. to be one of the finest men, and greatest sailor, I’ve ever met. God bless you, Don.</p>\n",

When navigating in the Caribbean I referred his guides and Imray-Iolaire charts.  One might note however that the sale of Heinekens will decline in West Cork !! </p>\n<p>Good Watch.</p>\n",
