    "content": "<p>Apparently, the two words have the same origin but salon appears to have predated saloon.</p>\n<p>The word comes from the French salon, and it originally had the same meaning, &#8220;living room.&#8221; Later, saloon meant &#8220;hall,&#8221; especially one on a boat or a train. In 1800&#8217;s America, it came to mean &#8220;public house or bar.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/saloon#:~:text=The%20word%20comes%20from%20the,%22public%20house%20or%20bar.%22\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/saloon#:~:text=The%20word%20comes%20from%20the,%22public%20house%20or%20bar.%22</a></p>\n",
