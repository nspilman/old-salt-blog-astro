    "content": "<p>Congratulations to Becky and Nathan!  We have sailed on the French several times, it’s a very special boat! We became friends with Dan and Kathy Pease then.  Garth Wells was the mate.  We sailed with Garth and Jenny also,  great people.  Met a lot of great people along the way.  One interesting thing Dan told me was that about 50% are repeat curtomers.That says a lot! It’s a wonderful vacation, so close to nature!  Great food too. Like minded folks, we made some life long friends too . Penobscot Bay is an incredible place to sail. My hat is off to them for sure.   Can’t wait to meet them! Best of luck to you for sure</p>\n",
