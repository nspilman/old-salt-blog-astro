    "content": "<p>The ship is referred to almost universally as a replica. Google &#8220;Mayflower II &#8221; and count all the references to &#8220;replica.&#8221; Even the 1957 newsreels refer to her as a &#8220;replica.&#8221; I see no reason to redefine the common usage of the word. The definition in use today seems to reflect the following:</p>\n<p>A ship replica is a reconstruction of a no longer existing ship. Replicas can range from authentically reconstructed, fully seaworthy ships, to ships of modern construction that give an impression of a historic vessel. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_replica#:~:text=A%20ship%20replica%20is%20a,impression%20of%20a%20historic%20vessel\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_replica#:~:text=A%20ship%20replica%20is%20a,impression%20of%20a%20historic%20vessel</a>.</p>\n<p>And if it is not a replica, what is it? The museum refers to it as a &#8220;reproduction,&#8221; which is arguably worse than &#8220;replica.&#8221;</p>\n",
