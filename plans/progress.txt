### Session 1 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Task 1 - Set up TypeScript migration script structure

**What was done:**
- Created scripts/migrate/ directory structure
- Created scripts/migrate/types.ts with all required TypeScript interfaces:
  - WordPress REST API types: WPPost, WPCategory, WPTag, WPMedia, WPUser, WPPage
  - Internal migration types: MigrationPost, MigrationPage, MigrationConfig, MigrationStats, LookupMaps
- Verified all required dependencies are already installed (turndown, turndown-plugin-gfm, p-limit, chalk)
- Added npm scripts for type-check and test to package.json
- Verified TypeScript compiles correctly with tsx
- All acceptance criteria met

**Next recommended task:**
- Task 2: Implement WordPress REST API fetchers (api.ts)
  - This is the logical next step as it depends on the types we just created
  - Will need to handle pagination, rate limiting, and build lookup maps
  - Should be straightforward with the types already defined

### Session 2 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Task 2 - Implement WordPress REST API fetchers

**What was done:**
- Created scripts/migrate/api.ts with full WordPress REST API fetching functionality
- Implemented all required fetch functions:
  - fetchPosts: Fetches all blog posts with pagination support
  - fetchCategories: Fetches all categories with pagination
  - fetchTags: Fetches all tags with pagination
  - fetchMedia: Fetches all media items with pagination
  - fetchUsers: Fetches all user information with pagination
  - fetchPages: Fetches all pages with pagination
- All fetch functions properly handle pagination using X-WP-TotalPages header
- Implemented rate limiting with configurable delay between requests
- Created buildLookupMaps function that creates Map<number, Entity> for easy ID lookups
- Created fetchAllData orchestrator that:
  - Fetches all data in parallel using Promise.all for efficiency
  - Builds lookup maps from the fetched data
  - Returns {posts, pages, lookups} structure
- Added comprehensive console logging for progress tracking
- Fixed TypeScript errors (variable shadowing with 'media', config property naming)
- All acceptance criteria met, type-check passes

**Next recommended task:**
- Task 3: Implement HTML to Markdown converter (converter.ts)
  - This depends on the types and will be used with the API data we can now fetch
  - Need to use Turndown library for HTML to Markdown conversion
  - Special handling needed for: images (keep WordPress URLs), YouTube/Vimeo iframes, <!--more--> tags
  - Must generate proper YAML frontmatter for posts and pages
