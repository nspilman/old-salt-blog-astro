### Session 1 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Task 1 - Set up TypeScript migration script structure

**What was done:**
- Created scripts/migrate/ directory structure
- Created scripts/migrate/types.ts with all required TypeScript interfaces:
  - WordPress REST API types: WPPost, WPCategory, WPTag, WPMedia, WPUser, WPPage
  - Internal migration types: MigrationPost, MigrationPage, MigrationConfig, MigrationStats, LookupMaps
- Verified all required dependencies are already installed (turndown, turndown-plugin-gfm, p-limit, chalk)
- Added npm scripts for type-check and test to package.json
- Verified TypeScript compiles correctly with tsx
- All acceptance criteria met

**Next recommended task:**
- Task 2: Implement WordPress REST API fetchers (api.ts)
  - This is the logical next step as it depends on the types we just created
  - Will need to handle pagination, rate limiting, and build lookup maps
  - Should be straightforward with the types already defined

---

### Session 2 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Task 2 - Implement WordPress REST API fetchers

**What was done:**

  - fetchTags: Fetches all tags with pagination
  - fetchMedia: Fetches all media items with pagination
  - fetchUsers: Fetches all user information with pagination
  - fetchPages: Fetches all pages with pagination
- All fetch functions properly handle pagination using X-WP-TotalPages header
- Implemented rate limiting with configurable delay between requests
- Created buildLookupMaps function that creates Map<number, Entity> for easy ID lookups
- Created fetchAllData orchestrator that:
  - Fetches all data in parallel using Promise.all for efficiency
  - Builds lookup maps from the fetched data
  - Returns {posts, pages, lookups} structure
- Added comprehensive console logging for progress tracking
- Fixed TypeScript errors (variable shadowing with 'media', config property naming)
- All acceptance criteria met, type-check passes

**Next recommended task:**
- Task 3: Implement HTML to Markdown converter (converter.ts)
  - This depends on the types and will be used with the API data we can now fetch
  - Need to use Turndown library for HTML to Markdown conversion
  - Special handling needed for: images (keep WordPress URLs), YouTube/Vimeo iframes, <!--more--> tags
  - Must generate proper YAML frontmatter for posts and pages

---

### Session 3 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Task 3 - Implement HTML to Markdown converter

- Created scripts/migrate/converter.ts with complete HTML to Markdown conversion functionality
- Implemented Turndown service with custom rules:
  - Custom iframe rule: Preserves YouTube/Vimeo iframes as raw HTML in markdown
  - Custom image rule: Extracts src only (ignores srcset), keeps original WordPress URLs
  - Custom figure rule: Handles WordPress figure/figcaption elements with captions
- Implemented helper functions:
  - decodeHtmlEntities: Decodes common HTML entities including smart quotes, mdash, hellip, etc.
  - stripMoreTags: Removes WordPress <!--more--> tags and related span elements

  - convertPostToMarkdown: Returns full markdown file content (frontmatter + content)
  - convertPageToMarkdown: Returns full markdown file content (frontmatter + content)
- Created type declaration file for turndown-plugin-gfm since @types package doesn't exist
- Fixed TypeScript errors with smart quotes by using unicode escape sequences
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - Images handled correctly (src only, original URLs kept)
  - YouTube/Vimeo iframes preserved as HTML
  - <!--more--> tags stripped
  - HTML entities decoded properly
  - Frontmatter functions generate valid YAML
  - Featured images use original WordPress URLs

**Next recommended task:**
- Task 4: Implement file writer for markdown output (writer.ts)
  - This will use the converter functions we just created
  - Need to write posts to src/content/blog/{slug}.md
  - Need to write pages to src/content/pages/{slug}.md
  - Must track statistics and handle errors gracefully
  - Write migration-report.json with results

---

### Session 4 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Task 4 - Implement file writer for markdown output

**What was done:**
- Created scripts/migrate/writer.ts with complete file writing functionality

- Features implemented:
  - Automatic directory creation (src/content/blog and src/content/pages)
  - Progress logging with chalk for colored console output (every 10 posts, every 5 pages)
  - Comprehensive error handling - failed posts/pages don't crash the migration
  - Error tracking in stats.errors array with type, slug, and error message
  - Statistics tracking: postsTotal, postsSuccess, postsFailed, pagesTotal, pagesSuccess, pagesFailed
  - Duration calculation in seconds for migration report
  - Console output shows summary with counts and errors
- Uses converter functions (convertPostToMarkdown, convertPageToMarkdown) to generate markdown files
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - Exports writePost, writePage, writeAllPosts, writeAllPages, writeStats
  - Posts written to src/content/blog/{slug}.md
  - Pages written to src/content/pages/{slug}.md
  - writeStats outputs migration-report.json with full stats
  - Error handling in place - logs errors and continues migration
- TypeScript type-checking passes with skipLibCheck

**Next recommended task:**
- Task 5: Create CLI entry point for migration (index.ts)
  - This will orchestrate all the components we've built (api.ts, converter.ts, writer.ts)
  - Need to create MigrationConfig from environment variables or defaults
  - Add progress logging and orchestrate: fetch -> convert -> write
  - Add npm script 'migrate' to package.json

---

### Session 5 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Task 5 - Create CLI entry point for migration

**What was done:**
- Created scripts/migrate/index.ts as the main CLI entry point for the migration
- Implemented loadConfig() function that reads configuration from environment variables with sensible defaults:
  - WP_BASE_URL (default: https://oldsaltblog.com)
  - OUTPUT_DIR (default: src/content)
  - DELAY (default: 100ms)
  - POSTS_PER_PAGE (default: 100)
- Implemented main migrate() function that orchestrates the entire migration process:
  - Step 1: Fetch all data from WordPress using fetchAllData()
  - Step 2: Write posts to disk using writeAllPosts()
  - Step 3: Write pages to disk using writeAllPages()
  - Step 4: Write migration report using writeStats()
- Added comprehensive progress logging with chalk for colored console output:
  - Blue headers for each migration step
  - Green success messages with counts
  - Yellow warnings for errors
  - Summary table showing posts/pages migrated and duration
- Initialized MigrationStats object to track migration progress
- Error handling: Catches and logs fatal errors, exits with code 1 on failure
- Exports migrate() and loadConfig() for potential reuse
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - scripts/migrate/index.ts is the executable entry point
  - MigrationConfig populated from environment variables with defaults
  - Progress logging shows detailed counts and steps
  - Migration orchestrates: fetch -> write (conversion happens in write functions)
  - npm script 'migrate' already exists in package.json (from earlier session)
- TypeScript type-checking passes (only unrelated errors in src/content.config.ts remain)

**Next recommended task:**
- Task 6: Run migration and verify output
  - This is the next logical step - run the migration script we just created
  - Will test the entire migration pipeline end-to-end
  - Need to verify: posts converted correctly, frontmatter valid, images use WP URLs
  - Check that migration completes without crashing
  - Review migration-report.json for any issues


### Session 6 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Task 6 - Run migration and verify output

**What was done:**
- Fixed bug in writer.ts where output paths were incorrectly constructed:
  - Changed from path.join(outputDir, 'src', 'content', 'blog') to path.join(outputDir, 'blog')
  - Changed from path.join(outputDir, 'src', 'content', 'pages') to path.join(outputDir, 'pages')
  - This fixed the issue where files were being written to src/content/src/content/blog/ instead of src/content/blog/
- Ran migration script successfully:
  - Fetched 6814 posts and 20 pages from oldsaltblog.com WordPress REST API
  - Fetched 16 categories, 18150 tags, 7 users, 6927 media items
  - Migration completed in 93 seconds
  - All 6814 posts written to src/content/blog/
  - All 20 pages written to src/content/pages/
  - Zero errors reported
- Verified all acceptance criteria:
  - npm run migrate completes without crashing ✓
  - 6814 posts successfully converted to markdown in src/content/blog/ ✓
  - Frontmatter parses as valid YAML ✓
  - Image URLs in content point to oldsaltblog.com (http://www.oldsaltblog.com/) ✓
  - Featured image URLs point to oldsaltblog.com (https://oldsaltblog.com/) ✓
  - YouTube embeds preserved as raw HTML in output ✓
  - migration-report.json shows complete stats (6814 posts success, 20 pages success, 0 failures) ✓
- Verified sample posts:
  - Checked post with images - images use original WordPress URLs
  - Checked post with YouTube embed - iframe preserved as HTML
  - Checked post with featured image - featuredImage URL uses WordPress URL
  - All frontmatter fields populated correctly (title, date, slug, excerpt, categories, tags, author, description)

**Next recommended task:**
- Task 7: Configure Astro content collections for blog (src/content/config.ts)
  - This is the logical next step now that we have migrated all content
  - Need to define blog collection schema matching our migration frontmatter
  - Schema should include: title, date, slug, excerpt, categories, tags, featuredImage, author, description
  - Will enable Astro to properly type and validate our blog content

### Session 7 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Task 7 - Configure Astro content collections for blog

**What was done:**
- Updated src/content.config.ts to define blog collection with proper schema matching migration frontmatter
- Schema includes all required fields: title, date, slug, excerpt (optional), categories, tags, featuredImage (optional), author, description (optional)
- Made categories and tags use .default([]) to handle posts without tags/categories
- Fixed multiple YAML frontmatter issues in converter.ts:
  - Created escapeYamlString() function to properly escape double quotes and smart quotes (U+201C, U+201D) in YAML strings
  - Added quotes around slug values to handle special characters like % (YAML directive character)
  - Fixed escaping to only escape backslashes and double quotes (not single quotes) since we use double-quoted strings in YAML
- Re-ran migration multiple times to fix all YAML issues
- Deleted example using-mdx.mdx file that didn't match schema
- Verified Astro content collection loads successfully - all 6814 blog posts synced correctly
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - src/content.config.ts defines 'blog' collection with full schema ✓
  - Schema matches frontmatter from migration script ✓
  - Content collection syncs successfully (npm run build starts and loads all 6814 posts) ✓
  - Collection types exported for use in components ✓

**Issues discovered and fixed:**
1. Smart quotes in tags/categories were not escaped properly - fixed by using Unicode escape sequences (\u201C, \u201D)
2. Slugs starting with % broke YAML parsing - fixed by quoting slug values
3. Single quotes were being incorrectly escaped inside double-quoted strings - removed single quote escaping
4. Some posts had no tags field - fixed by adding .default([]) to schema

**Next recommended task:**
- Task 8: Create blog post page template (src/pages/[slug].astro)
  - This is the logical next step now that content collections are configured
  - Need to create dynamic route for /{slug}/ URL structure
  - Display post content with frontmatter fields (title, date, author, categories, tags, featuredImage)
  - Add SEO meta tags
  - Will need to fix existing templates that expect old schema
