### Session 1 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Task 1 - Set up TypeScript migration script structure

**What was done:**
- Created scripts/migrate/ directory structure
- Created scripts/migrate/types.ts with all required TypeScript interfaces:
  - WordPress REST API types: WPPost, WPCategory, WPTag, WPMedia, WPUser, WPPage
  - Internal migration types: MigrationPost, MigrationPage, MigrationConfig, MigrationStats, LookupMaps
- Verified all required dependencies are already installed (turndown, turndown-plugin-gfm, p-limit, chalk)
- Added npm scripts for type-check and test to package.json
- Verified TypeScript compiles correctly with tsx
- All acceptance criteria met

**Next recommended task:**
- Task 2: Implement WordPress REST API fetchers (api.ts)
  - This is the logical next step as it depends on the types we just created
  - Will need to handle pagination, rate limiting, and build lookup maps
  - Should be straightforward with the types already defined
